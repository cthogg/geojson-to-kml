## ROADMAP:

- Get all data on there. ✅
- Get the simple blue plauqe data to organic maps. ✅
- Get listed buildings to organic maps. ✅
- Get the simple data to google maps.
- Get a link to wikipedia for each blue plaque /place of interest. Should then probably save the link in the database /external one. See the thing which I have removed in the commit TODO:.
- Try and make the description and title more interesting with appropriate formatting.
- Try and get pictures and make it more exciting.
- Perhaps, perhaps?? Make a SQLite or postgres database to store the data.
- Postgres is probably better for geo data compared to SQLite... but SQLite is easier to use.
