### AI generated text
This impressive building, known as Chestnuts House, dates back to 1745-1747 and stands as a fine example of Georgian architecture in Walthamstow, London. The structure is constructed with stock brick and red dressings, featuring a pitched tiled roof with a parapet.
The main facade facing Hoe Street consists of 7 bays, with a further recessed bay to the right and an additional wing beyond. The center 3 bays are more closely spaced and set slightly forward, with a pediment above. The central entrance is highlighted by a pedimented doorcase with Doric pilasters, though the door itself is a late 20th century addition.
Observe the decorative brick band between the stories, the main cornice of rubbled brick above the first floor, and the subsidiary cornice to the attic. The windows are segmental-headed, with sash windows and thick glazing bars. A blind semicircular window can be seen above the pediment in the attic.
To the right, there is a 6-bay, 2-story wing that is recessed, with similar architectural treatment. An advanced stable wing of 3 bays is attached to the right, featuring blind relieving arches.
The interior of Chestnuts House has been well-preserved, with a paved stair hall and a fine openwell staircase featuring turned balusters and stucco floral enrichment. Original paneling and cornices can be found throughout, with the main rooms displaying more elaborate molding compared to the simpler servant's areas, which also have a dog-leg turned baluster staircase.
