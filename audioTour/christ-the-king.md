You are an architectural tour guide. Can you describe the listed building in this text and images.
Please can you do so in a way which would interest a person with a lay interest in historical architecture, pointing out specific features on the building to look out for. Please describe the as if you are standing in front of it.

You are standing in front of Church of Christ the King, a magnificent Grade I listed building in Bloomsbury, London. It's a stunning example of Early English Neo-Gothic architecture from the 1850s.

First, let's admire the church's distinctive Bath stone exterior, which gives it that beautiful honey-golden color you can see clearly in both photographs. The building was designed by Raphael Brandon and, interestingly, it's actually incomplete – though you might not realize it at first glance!

Let me point out some spectacular features to look for:

1. The Rose Window: Look at that magnificent circular window in the transept (the cross-section of the church). It's particularly special because it was designed by Archibald Keightley Nicholson and features a dove surrounded by musician angels, cherubim, and seraphim. Below it, you'll see three lancet windows depicting Christ in Majesty.

2. The Spires and Turrets: Notice those distinctive octagonal corner turrets with their pointed spires. These are classic Gothic elements, and if you look closely, you'll see they have beautiful gabled niches worked into them. Each one terminates in what we call "gablets" – small decorative gables.

3. The Windows: The building showcases a wonderful hierarchy of window styles. You can see the paired lancet windows (the tall, pointed arch windows) along the sides, and above them, the clerestory windows that would have flooded the interior with light. What's particularly interesting is the plate tracery in some windows – that's the decorative stonework pattern you can see, particularly in that beautiful rose window.

What's fascinating about this church is what's missing! The western end was never fully completed – it was meant to have two more bays and a grand façade. Even more ambitious, there was supposed to be a crossing tower with a 150-foot spire! The base of this tower was built, and you can see it has mostly blind arcading (decorative arches that don't actually open).

A fun fact that really puts the scale of this church in perspective – the nave is only 13 feet lower than Westminster Abbey's! This wasn't just ambitious architecture; it was cathedral-scale thinking.

Inside there's an extraordinary hammer beam roof with angel decorations and unique snowflake-design bosses (those decorative elements where the beams meet). The church also houses a remarkable organ built by Gray and Davison in 1853, which adds to both its historical and musical significance.

Today, while it was originally built for the Catholic Apostolic Church (also known as the Irvingites), it's used by the Anglican mission Euston Church and Forward in Faith movement, showing how these magnificent buildings can adapt to serve different communities while maintaining their architectural splendor.

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of the church's architecture or history?
