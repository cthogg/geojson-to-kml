### AI generated text
This impressive building in front of us is the former Dillon's Bookshop, located on the corner of Torrington Place, Gower Street, and Malet Street in London. Constructed in 1907-1908, the building was designed by architect Charles Fitzroy Doll in an elaborate Franco-Flemish Gothic style.

The exterior is characterized by its striking red brick façade with terracotta and stone dressings. The steeply pitched, tiled roof features gables and tall chimneys, adding to the building's ornate appearance. Vertical attached columns, recessed rainwater pipes, and horizontal strings create a sense of rhythm and symmetry across the three-story façade.

Particularly noteworthy are the canted, three-light bay windows that span the first and second floors. These are beautifully detailed, with enriched transoms, tracery, and carved aprons featuring mythical beasts, coats of arms, and foliage. Above each bay is a large gable with a carved finial and seated figures in the tympanum.

The corners of the building are marked by octagonal turrets with tiled conical roofs, further enhancing the building's striking silhouette. The ground floor has been modified, but the upper levels retain their ornate architectural features, including the elaborately carved parapets and gargoyles.

The building's impressive wrought and cast-iron railings and gates along Gower Street are also worth noting, with their scroll designs and elaborate floral finials.

This remarkable example of early 20th-century commercial architecture is a testament to the attention to detail and craftsmanship of its time, blending functionality with an exuberant, decorative style.

[[File:Dillons-Gower-St-sign-1996.jpg|thumb|The main entrance to Dillons' flagship [[Gower Street, London|Gower Street]] branch in [[London]] in 1996]]
'''Dillons''' was a British [[bookseller]] founded in 1936, named after its founder and owner [[Una Dillon]]. Originally based in [[Bloomsbury]] in [[London]], the company expanded under subsequent owners [[Pentos]] in the 1980s into a bookselling chain across the United Kingdom. In 1995 Pentos went into receivership and sold Dillons to [[Thorn EMI]], which immediately closed 40 of the 140 Dillons bookstore locations. Of the remaining 100 stores, most kept the name Dillons, while the remainder were [[Hatchards]] and [[Hodges Figgis]].<ref name=Stevenson>{{cite web |last1=Stevenson |first1=Tom |title='Second time lucky' hope of Rymans' buyer| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/second-time-lucky-hope-of-rymans-buyer-1612028.html|work=[[The Independent]]|location=[[London]] |date= 20 March 1995  |access-date=8 March 2020 }}</ref><ref name=Shepherd>{{cite web |last1=Shepherd |first1=John |title=Thorn EMI closes 40 Dillons bookstores| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/thorn-emi-closes-40-dillons-bookstores-1612658.html|work=[[The Independent]]|location=[[London]] |date= 25 March 1995  |access-date=8 March 2020 }}</ref> Within Thorn EMI, Dillons was placed in the [[HMV|HMV Group]], which had been a division of Thorn EMI since 1986.

==History==
===Store Street===
[[File:Store Street, London.JPG|thumbnail|[[Store Street, London]], site of the first Dillons Bookshop in 1936]]
Dillon's Bookshop was founded by [[Una Dillon]] in 1936 at 9 [[Store Street, London|Store Street]], between [[Gower Street, London|Gower Street]] and [[Tottenham Court Road]] in [[Bloomsbury]].<ref name=dnb>{{cite odnb |first=Jean H. |last=Cook |title=Dillon, Agnes Joseph Madeline [Una] (1903–1993) |origyear=2004 |year=2009 }}</ref> Dillon had become involved in the book trade through running bookstalls for the [[Mind (charity)|Central Association for Mental Welfare]] after graduating from [[Bedford College, London]].<ref name=dnb /> Determined to build a career in bookselling she persuaded the owner of a failing bookshop to sell her the business for £800, borrowing £600 off her father and £200 from a friend.<ref name="independent">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-una-Dillon-1455775.html |title=Obituary: Una Dillon |date=1993-04-17 |work=[[The Independent]]|location=London |access-date=2017-04-11 |language=en-GB}}</ref>

Dillon stocked both academic and general titles, believing that specialisation stifled curiosity,<ref name=dnb /> and the shop prospered catering to the needs of staff and students of the nearby [[University of London]].<ref name="independent" /> Dillon would deliver books herself by bicycle within eight hours and the shop began to attract bibliophiles, with regular customers including [[Cecil Day-Lewis]] and [[John Betjeman]], who would also become Dillon's personal friends.<ref name="dnb" />

The outbreak of [[World War II]] saw the nearby University of London and [[Froebel College]] evacuated from London, but instead of closing for the war Dillon maintained contact with her customers and shipped orders to their new locations in [[Cardiff]], [[Leicester]] and [[Hertfordshire]],<ref name="dnb" /> while also building a new customer base with the staff of the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] who were now established in [[Senate House, London|Senate House]].<ref name="independent" /> When her shop suffered bomb damage she temporarily operated from an empty shop opposite.<ref name="dnb" />

===Dillon's University Bookshop===
[[File:Waterstone's Bookshire, Malet Street WC1 - geograph.org.uk - 1567108.jpg|thumb|upright|Dillon's University Bookshop originally occupied just the east end of the building that it would later take over completely]]
After the war Dillon increasingly focused on educational titles and her shop became an important supplier of books to students from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].<ref name="dnb" /> Further expansion was impossible without outside support, however, and Dillon was one of several booksellers approached by the [[University of London]], who were looking to form a partnership to open a bookshop alongside a chemist and a newsagent in a block the university had acquired after the war on [[Torrington Place]], [[Gower Street, London|Gower Street]] and [[Malet Street]].<ref name="dnb" /> The block had been designed by architect [[Charles Fitzroy Doll]] and built in 1908 as a residential building with shops on the ground floor.{{sfn|Maher|1994|p=62}}

Although the initial proposal for a partnership fell through, in 1956 Dillon was again approached by the university, and agreed to use her stock and goodwill from Store Street to purchase a minority stake in a bookshop on the new site, on the understanding that the new shop would bear her name.<ref name="dnb" /> The university contributed £11,000 in capital that it had obtained as an insurance payment for the death in a building accident of a workman who had no relatives.<ref name="independent" />

When it opened in 1956, Dillon's University Bookshop only occupied the small part of the building at 1 Malet St, and in its first year saw turnover of £30,000.<ref name="independent" /> Una Dillon retired as managing director of the business in 1967 – by which time the shop occupied the entire building and had an annual turnover of over £1m – but she remained as a board member until 1977.<ref name="independent" /> Her place as managing director was taken by Peter Stockham. then followed a period when Dillons was controlled by the unions (Actss). Then in 1977, Grant Paton, from Glasgow, was appointed managing director by the then owners, University of London. It was taken over shortly afterwards by [[Pentos]].

===Expansion under Pentos===
Back in private hands by the mid-1980s, the store undertook a major makeover and modernisation, announcing its relaunch with the advertising poster "Foyled again? Try Dillons" displayed prominently on the bus shelter opposite its London rival [[Foyles]].<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-jun-11-mn-45427-story.html Christina Foyle; Managed Noted London Bookshop], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 11 June 1999.</ref>

Inspired by the success of Waterstones, demonstrating the potential for large modern bookshops with a depth of stock, the new owners [[Pentos]] rapidly rolled out the format across the country, ultimately building up a chain of 75 stores. In 1990 Dillons bought [[Hatchards]], based in [[Piccadilly]] and the oldest bookshop in the UK.<ref>{{cite news |title=Last chapter for Pentos Buyer likely for Dillons |url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12660135.last-chapter-for-pentos-buyer-likely-for-dillons/|work=The Herald|location=Glasgow |date=1995-03-02 |access-date=2021-10-17}}</ref> However, having overreached itself financially,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/pentos-dealing-halted-1575269.html |title=Pentos dealing halted |date=1995-02-28 |work=The Independent|location=London |access-date=2017-05-03|language=en-GB}}</ref> Dillons was acquired by Thorn EMI, which already held the HMV chain, for £36 million.<ref>{{Cite web|date=22 October 2011|title=Dillons sold for £36m|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/dillons-sold-for-163-36m-1609830.html|access-date=2 March 2021|website=The Independent|location=London}}</ref>

HMV acquired the larger Waterstones chain in 1998, and the following year the Dillons brand ceased to exist as a separate entity when the branches were rebranded as Waterstones.<ref>{{Cite news|date=15 January 2013|title=Things you may not know about HMV|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/things-you-may-not-know-about-hmv-1.1071273|access-date=2 March 2021|newspaper=The Irish Times}}</ref> A remainder were sold on to the smaller chain [[Ottakar's]], which itself was later taken over by Waterstones in 2006.
