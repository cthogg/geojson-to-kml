Let me give you a tour of this fascinating building - The Lighthouse Methodist Church, which is one of Walthamstow's most distinctive Victorian landmarks.
Look at the tower. What makes this church truly special is that striking lighthouse tower on the corner. It's not something you'd typically expect to find on a church, especially this far inland! Built in 1893, this quirky feature was inspired by the building's patron, Captain King, who ran steamship services to East Africa. Originally, it even had a working revolving light that would beam out during Sunday morning services. Notice the spiral white molding running up the tower and those unusual cross-shaped slit windows - they really enhance the maritime theme.
The building is a wonderful example of late Victorian architecture, combining stock brick with rich red brick details. Look at how the architect, J. Williams Dunford, created such a lively, almost playful façade. You can see those distinctive red brick columns, or ribs, dividing the front into sections. These actually borrowed their style from Salvation Army buildings of the period, where they were meant to give a fortress-like appearance.
There are some lovely architectural details to spot. Above the windows, you can see terracotta decorations with garlands, and if you look up to the gable end, there's an oculus - that round window - with 'AD 1893' carved at the top. The plaques on the front proudly display 'United Methodist' and 'Free Churches', and there's even one that reads 'Have Faith in God' on the lighthouse tower.
Look at the entrance. The doors are all original, and look at that grand central entrance with its pediment supported by those impressive scroll brackets. It's a really confident piece of Victorian civic architecture.
What's particularly interesting is how this building reflects its time - it's more reminiscent of a mission hall than a traditional church, which was quite deliberate. In fact, it was incredibly popular - by 1903, it had congregations of over 1,500 people!
Looking up again The whole composition has this wonderfully asymmetrical, almost whimsical quality, especially with that lighthouse tower breaking up the roofline. It's a Grade II listed building now, and while the interior has been modified over the years, the exterior remains largely as it was when it first opened its doors in 1893.
