Welcome to the Victoria and Albert Museum's magnificent main entrance, designed by Aston Webb and built between 1899 and 1909. This impressive facade showcases a fascinating blend of Renaissance and medieval architectural styles.

Look up at the grand central tower with its distinctive open-work crown topped by a statue of Fame - a feature you might typically see in Scottish Gothic architecture, though here it's blended with Classical details. The main entrance archway below is particularly interesting - it's Romanesque in form but Classical in its ornamentation. Within this arch, you'll spot a statue of Prince Albert, while Queen Victoria appears just above the entrance frame, both sculpted by Alfred Drury.

Notice the beautiful mullioned and transomed windows along the facade - these are Gothic-inspired features. Between the top row of windows, you can see statues of British artists whose works are displayed inside the museum.

The entire facade stretches an impressive 720 feet and is constructed from red brick and Portland stone. Today, you can see some historic pockmarks on the facade - these are actually from bomb fragments from World War II, a reminder of the building's resilience through London's history.
