    "inscription": "Admiral Thomas Hardy\r\n05 April 1769 - 20 September 1839\r\n\r\nHardy was born on 5th April 1769 in Portisham, Dorset.\r\nHe first entered the navy in 1781 on board the brig, HMS Helena.\r\nHe remained with the ship for a short period after which, in 1782,\r\nhe left the navy to attend school for three years. He joined the merchant\r\nnavy for some years and in 1790, decided to rejoin the Royal Navy. His\r\nfirst appointment as midshipman was with HMS Hebe. He was later transferred\r\nto the sloop, HMS Tisphone, and followed the Captain, Anthony Hunt, when he \r\nwas transferred to HMS Amphitrite in 1793.\r\nIn November of that year, he was promoted to Lieutenant and appointed to HMS\r\nMeleager. This ship was part of a squadron off the coast of Genoa under the \r\ncommand of Captain Horatio Nelson. In August 1796, Hardy transferred to HMS\r\nMinerve with Captain Cockburn. At the end of the year, Nelson transferred to\r\nthe Sabina, Hardy, along with Lieutenant Culverhouse, was in charge of a boarding\r\nparty sent to claim her as a prize after her capture. They managed to draw off\r\nthe rest of the Spanish squadron, but the ship was later re-captured after\r\none of her masts was destroyed and Hardy was taken prisoner along with the rest\r\nof the boarding party.\r\n\r\nHe was later repatriated with the Minerve at Gibraltar after an exchange of \r\nprisoners, which included the Captain of the Sabina. Captain Nelson was warm\r\nin praise of the actions of his lieutenants in this action.\r\nShortly after rejoining his ship, Hardy was nearly captured again by the \r\nSpanish when he jumped overboard to save a seaman who was drowning after \r\nfalling out of one of the boats. The current had carried them towards the lead\r\nship of the Spanish squadron in the Gibraltar Straits. Nelson took instant action\r\nby ordering shorten their sail and stand off. Hardy and the seaman were\r\nrescued. A few days later, the ship had joined the British fleet and took part\r\nin the battle of Cape St Vincent on 14 February 1797.\r\nIn the following Maym HMSs Minerve and Lively were patrolling around the bay of\r\nSanta Cruz and found a French brig, the Mutine. On the 29th, longboats\r\nfrom the two ships were sent to capture it under Hardy's command. It\r\nwas successful and Hardy was appointed to command of the prize by Admiral\r\nJervis. He also was promoted to Commander.\r\n\r\nHardy went to the Mediterranean with Nelson, who had been appointed Commander\r\nin Chief. In July 1803, Nelson transferred to HMS Victory and Hardy joined him to \r\nresume his position as Flag Captain.During the following months and years, the\r\nship was kept busy with the blockade of Toulon and continuing pursuit of the \r\nFranco-Spanish fleet across the Atlantic. Hardy, along with Captain Blackwood,\r\nwitnessed Nelson's last will and during the battle of Trafalgar on \r\nOctober 21st 1805, was walking along side his Commander in chief when a \r\nFrench spiner fatally shot Nelson. As Nelson's Chief of Staff, he remained\r\non duty during the remainder of the battle while keeping his dying friend\r\nand Commabder informed of the proceedings. In recognition for these\r\nservices, he was created a baronet. He played a major part in the state\r\nfuneral of Nelson on 9 January 1806 at St Paul's Cathedral.\r\n\r\nHardy was decorated as a Knight Commander of the Order of Bath in\r\nJanuary 1815 and returned to Britain in June of that year. On his return,\r\nhe was appointed to command the Royal Yacht Princess Augusta. He served\r\non her for three years. In August 1819, he was promoted to Commodore and\r\nappointed as Commander in Chief for the South American station. He\r\ntransferred his flag to HMS Superb and his services during the war of\r\nindependence that was being fought in the former Spanish colonies won\r\nhim praise from the Admiralty. He eventually returned to Britain in 1824.\r\n\r\nIn 1830, he was appointed as First Sea Lord at the Admiralty. He\r\nretained this post until 1834. During this period, he was appointed\r\nas Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Bath. At the end of his period\r\nas First Sea Lord, he was appointed as Governor of Greenwich Hospital.\r\nDuring his time as Governor, he introduced many changes to improve the lives\r\nof the pensioners. He was promoted as Vice Admiral in January 1837.\r\nHardy died on 20th September 1839 and was buried in the mausoleum in the \r\ngrounds of Greenwich Hospital. His wife and daughters survived him, but\r\nas he had no male heirs, his baronetcy became extinct.",

First as a Saxon convent, thought to have been founded in 606, it became the Priory of St. Mary for Augustinian canons in 1106. The canons established the famous hospital of St. Thomas that was moved to Lambeth in the 19th century. After the dissolution of the monastery in 1539 the Priory Church became the Parish Church of St. Saviour, in the Diocese of Winchester. In 1905 it was made a Cathedral with its own diocese, to serve the spiritual and material needs of south London's growing population. \r\n\r\nIn monastic times the parish church was in the Chapel of St. Mary Magdalene formerly on the south side of the chancel (to your left) but demolished in 1822 during restoration work on the choir. You are looking down at the East Churchyard which contains the foundations of the 14th-century Lady Chapel and Bishop Andrewes' burial chapel. There also used to be houses built right up to the church. All these were demolished in the 1830s to make way for the approach road to John Rennie's new London Bridge. An outstanding scholar, Bishop Andrewes was part of the committee which translated the Bible into English for King James I in 1611.",

Renamed in October 1982 to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the death of Jeremy Bentham who is recognised as the spiritual founder of University College London. The myth that he was the founder is sustained in a bizarre manner by the college.\r\nHis 'Auto-Icon' as he called it, is in fact his skeleton, dressed in his own clothes and topped with a wax model of his head.\r\nHis actual head is mummified and kept in the college vaults. It is brought out for meetings of the college council and he is recorded as being present but not voting. Above the bar can be seen a copy of the wax head, made by students at the college In renaming the pub after him we are reminded of his greatest ideal, \"The greatest happiness of the greatest numbers.\"\r\n\"A GREAT MAN HAS GONE FROM AMONG US, FULL OF YEARS OF GOOD WORKS AND OF DESERVED HONOURS IN THE HIGHEST DEPARTMENTS IN WHICH THE HUMAN INTELLECT CAN EXERT ITSELF. HE HAS NOT LEFT HIS EQUAL OR HIS SECOND BEHIND HIM\"",

Part of the ground was used for market gardening, but much of it was a marshy waste reclaimed from the river in the sixteenth century  and later used for pigeon shooting, fairs, donkey racing and other amusements.  The famous duel between the Duke of Wellington and the Earl of Wichelsea took place here in 1829.  In 1846, an act authorised the purchase by H.M. Office of Works of 320 acres in Battersea Fields for a public park.  The fields were drained and their level raised by soil excavated from the Victoria Docks.  The cost of embarking and laying out the park was covered by the sale of part of the ground for building.  The park, which is 200 acres in extent, was handed over to the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1887.  Transferred to the London County Council in 1889 and the Greater London Council in 1965.  Since 1986 it has been managed by Wandsworth Borough Council.",

In the Middle Ages farmers from Kent and Surrey used to drive their cattle up to London for sale at Smithfield Market. The fields around the Maze Pond were a focal point where the cattle were grazed and watered.\r\n\"Mr Guy's Hospital for Incurables\" was built on this site in 1725. John Rocque's 1746 Map of London shows the pond still in existence.

He was among the first to appreciate the vital importance of R.D.F (Radar) and of an effective command and control system for his squadrons. They were ready when war came.\r\n\r\nIn the preliminary stages of that war, he thoroughly trained  his minimal forces and conserved them against strong political pressures to disperse an misuse them. His wise and prudent judgement and leadership helped to ensure victory against overwhelming odds and thus prevented  the loss of the Battle of Britain and probably the whole war.\r\n\r\nTo him the people of Britain and of the free world owe largely the way of life and liberties they enjoy today.\r\n",

The 2001 restoration re-established the integrity of the timber frame and as such realigned many of the timers. The wall at ground level along Orford Road was built in 1934 to look as if it was deformed Tudor brickwork. This 1934 architectural conceit, which was executed superbly by the bricklayer, has been retained as part of the history of the house.",

It was rebuilt in preparation of the transfer of services to the Piccadilly line on 4 July 1932.\r\nThis new extension was, together with the existing tracks back to Acton Town, the first experimental section of the Underground’s surface lines to be electrified and operated electric instead of steam trains.\r\nSudbury Hill was to see the full development of the format and style Charles Holden had designed as Sudbury Town station in 1931, which he was to use for the majority of Underground stations during the 1930s.  The main structure consists of a red brick ‘box’, topped with a flat concrete roof.  The high ticket hall is illuminated by a large vertical window within each facade and an Underground roundel, with original graphics, is inset into the glazing above the entrance.  The design of the rest of the building deliberately integrates the overbridge, staircases to platforms and the waiting room accommodation into the overall architectural idiom.\r\nThe station still remains much of the original decor with the use of timber and bronze finishes for seats, poster frames and telephone booths.  However, the original passimeter (ticket booth) has since been replaced by a modern ticketing system.",

It saw the move away from the use of Portland stone, as had been seen on his previous designs for stations such as Ealing Common, towards a more European idiom based on unadorned concrete and brick that was a real change in British architecture of the day.  It is viewed by many many as being one of Britain’s best buildings of the time.\r\nThe main structure consists of a red Buckinghamshire brisk ‘box’, flanked by single storey extension and all topped by concrete flat roof.  Each facade is punctuated by a large vertical window that allows natural daylight to flood in and at night, be illuminated - making the building, as intended, a beacon in suburbia.  The design also integrates the overbridge and other buildings.  The ticket hall still retains much of the original decor including the timber passimeter and, on the platforms, the original designs for concrete fencing and lampposts are still used.

It was the first world exhibition of design, technology and innovation, displaying exhibits from Britain, the British Empire and the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nFor the first time, the site in Hyde Park has been marked. Five recycled glass and concrete plaques now stand on the footprint and former entrance to the building. Early examples of the materials and techniques used in this project were displayed in the Great Exhibition. This public art project commemorates the 160th anniversary of the Great Exhibition.\r\n\r\nDesigned by Joseph Paxton, the Great Exhibition building was nicknamed the 'Crystal Palace'. It was the world's first large-scale prefabricated building. Measuring 1848ft by 108ft, the spectacular structure was built using glass and iron. From where you are standing, it would have spanned roughly 924ft (281 metres) to your left and right.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition presented over 100,000 exhibits, including a black diamond from Brazil, a barometer using leeches, a prototype submarine. Smith & Weston rifles and edible birds nests from Java. The legacy of the Great Exhibition continues to this day.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 staged the landmark project. The Commission continues to support research and cultural projects with the profits from the exhibition.",

Members approaching the House of Commons through this archway passed down the Cloister, which is built against the other side of this wall, ascended a flight of steps leading from the South West corner of the Cloister to a vestibule attached to the west front of St Stephen's Chapel, & entered the building by the Western doorways.\r\nKing Charles I passed through this archway. when on the 4th January 1641-2, he attempted to arrest in the House of Commons the five Members of Parliament.\r\nThis access to the House of Commons fell into disuse after the year 1680. A doorway was then cut through the centre of the South wall of this Hall which led to the entrance into the House of Commons through the West doors of St Stephen's Chapel. a route which remained in use until that building was destroyed by the fire of the 16th October 1834",

To commemorate the Great Fire of London 1666.  the fire burnt from 2 to 5 September, devastating two-thirds of the city, and destroying 13,200 houses, 87 churches, and 52 Livery Company Halls.  The Monument, a freestanding fluted Doric column topped by a flaming copper urn, is 61m/202ft in height, being equal to the distance westward from the site of the bakery in Puddin Lane where the fire first broke out.  It's central shaft originally housed lenses for a zenith telescope, and its balcony, reached by an internal spiral staircase of 311 steps, affords panoramic views of the city.  The allegorical sculpture on the pedestal above was executed by Caius Gabriel Cibber and shows Charles II coming to assist the slumped figure of the City of London.  St Magnus the Martyr  Fish Hill Street, ot the south, leads to St Magnus the Martyr, a Wren church, alongside which is the ancient street which led to the medieval London Bridge",

The pub is named after Lieutenant-General John Manners the eldest son of the 3rd Duke of Rutland.  Manners did not survive his father so he was known by his father's subsidiary title, Marquis of Granby.  Granby served as overall commander of the British troops on the battlefield in the Seven Year's War during the 18th century.  He was subsequently rewarded with the post of Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in 1766.  Granby was very popular with his troops often rewarding his men from his own pocket; some of the beneficiaries set themselves up as publicans naming their inns in his honour.  The Marquis of Granby is best known today for supposedly having more pubs named after him than any other person.  Here, at Romney Street, The Marquis of Granby is a historic pub with parliamentary connections; it houses a division bell that still rings today to call MPs back to Parliament.",

The station was heavily redeveloped during that period, resulting in the demolition of the original c1870 highly ornate facade. The sign is typical of those designed for use on the Underground during the late 1920s and early 1930s when much thought was given to the standardisation of  sign design and typefaces used.  The sign displays the ones heavy timber frames used – In the early 1930s Charles Holden developed a slimmer bronze frame for signs used on new and reconstructed stations. It appears that many older stations that received new signs at this time continued to have the timber framed versions.\r\n\r\nThe pale yellow background was also commonly used – along with the use of the purposely designed Johnston black lettering that works so well in this situation being both legible and authoritative. The style of the arrow, the flight of which appears to pierce the ring of the roundel, is also indicative of the sign’s age. This device, commonly known as ‘Mexican arrow’, was used on signs from the mid-1920s until the 1960s as a unique graphic tool and also added familiarity to the brand London Transport. The use of four flights to the arrow dates it to the years either side of 1930. By c1932 it was used with three flights and later decades saw the number gradually drop to two, then one and finally none.\r\n\r\nThe site was donated by Mr. A H Rolph",

    "inscription": "Railway Heritage Feature\r\n\r\nRichmond Station sign \r\n(c1935-38)\r\n\r\nThis vitreous enamel sign stood, for many years, outside Richmond Richmond mainline station. Photographic evidence shows it in place by the late 1930s and it appears to have been removed during the 1970s.  The date of manufacture can certainly be better understood given the overall design and various styles of lettering and logos it shows.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1930s, when the new London Transport (formed in 1933) experimented with various designs of signs, most used his pale yellow background with the maroon border.  The arrow at the base of the sign was known as a ‘Mexican arrow’ and this example, with three flights on the arrow, dates it to post 1933, as prior to that date it would have had four flights. The sign also uses colour blocks as background to the text and this was increasingly used as a device by the Underground during this period. The design of some signs was further standardised when, in 1938, LT issued the first ‘Standard Signs Manual’.\r\n\r\nRichmond was owned and primarily served by the Southern Railway who, during this period developed their own ‘house style’ that included this “sunshine” style of lined out lettering. The underground logo, using the company’s Johnston typeface, has the distinctive white bands (or “ribbons”) above and below the letters. Then, as now, Richmond was served by the district line. The “LMS” lettering refers to the London Midland & Scottish Railway, another of the ‘big four’ railway companies that had been formed in 1923, and ran the North London Railway services between Richmond and Broad Street. This service is now provided by London Overground\r\n\r\nThe sign is a fascinating reminder of an earlier period of ‘co-ordination’ of elements of London's transport service that finally came to fruition with the formation of TfL. LU acquired the sign in 2008 from a private collector, who had salvaged the sign when it was removed, and is displayed here as part of LU’s heritage.",

In September of that year more than 500 people died in Soho from the disease.  Snow had studied cholera in the 1848-9 epidemic in South London and developed a novel theory that polluted drinking water caused the disease.  He recognised that cholera cases were clustered around the water pump located here and showed it was the cause of the epidemic.  His theory initially met with some disbelief but he convinced the parish council to remove the pump’s handle on the 8th September 1854, to prevent its further use.  Removal of the pump handle has become an international symbol of public health.  The John Snow Society was founded in 1992 to commemorate Dr Snow’s work.  The original pump was situated outside the site where the John Snow public house now stands and this replica has been returned to its historic location, previously marked by a pink granite kerbstone.",

The railway quickly saw the benefits to expansion beyond London and had reached Harrow by 1880 and Pinner by 1885.  As the popularity of the Pinner extension grew local developers started to build housing alongside the line and in 1912 the board agreed to build a new station at North Harrow to serve these developments.  In the years that followed, this development became known as 'Metro-land'.  The original station, consisting only of the wooden shelter you are currently standing in, opened in 1915.  Due to increased demand a much improved station opened in 1931 to a design by Charles Clark, Chief Architect for the Metropolitan Railway.  This forms the current station which remains true to the original design.  This commemorative plaque was unveiled by London Underground's Managing Director, Mike Brown, on 20th March 2015 to celebrate the centenary of this station. ",

    "inscription": "Manor House station Architect: Adams, Holden & Pearson (Charles Holden) 1932  Opening on 19 September 1932, this was the first station on the northern extension of the Piccadilly line beyond Finsbury Park.  The station has very little prominence at street level with only limited canopy structures over the park-side entrances.  There were also originally subways that served now demolished tram loading shelters designed so to make best use of space and Holden took great care in the details and finishes to features such as the central columns.  The ceiling, decorated in a pattern of circular mouldings with inset lighting, compliments the unusual shape of the ticket hall.  The platforms were lined to give an elliptical, or egg shaped, profile to enable the recessing of equipement and furniture to give clear lines of sight.  The platforms tiles were originally made by Carter's Poole Potter in Dorset and are similar to other adjacent stations apart from the different coloured border tiles - here they are blue.  Also of note are the bronze ventilation grilles that depict a styalised play on the station name.   These were designed by Harold Stabler R.D.I., a notable artist and designer, who was eleected a \"Royal Designer for Industry\" in 1936.  He was closely connected with the Poole Pottery.  In 2006 a modernisation of the station resulted in the platform wall tilies being sensitively replicated according to the original design.  In addition the crude strip lighting that had disfigured the ticket hall was removed.",

The mortgage was transferred during the following year to Oliver Humphries and later to a carpenter named Kendrick.  The present tavern was a simple alehouse without an inn sign. It was during this era that the reigning sovereign, George III, began to be effected by metal illness, and for a while he stayed privately in Queen Square under the care of Dr. Willis.  The doctor’s treatment which was temporarily successful, was helped by the King’s Consort, Queen Charlotte, who rented a small underground cellar beneath the present tavern in which She stored special delicacies for her sick husband.  When the alehouse became a tavern later in George’s reign , it was named the Queen’s Larder in Charlotte’s honour.  The Queen’s Larder stands in a neighbourhood that is famous for its hospitals and its Foundling Home.   Writing of the area R.I. Stevenson once observed that it seemed to have been set aside for “the humanities of life and the alleviation of all hard destinies”",

The imposing monument known locally as the 'Martys' Memorial (unveiled in October 1888) commemorates three of Kent's Protestant martyrs burned at the stake in 1555. One of the martyrs, a local linen weaver named Christopher Wild, was publickly burned at Dartford Brent on 17th July 1555. This is the second Martyrs' Memorial to occupy the site. The first was erected in the 1850s but suffered extensive erosion after only 40 years. Richard Trevithick, inventor of the steam locomotive, died at Dartford on 22 April 1833, and is buried here in an unmarked grave. Other notable residents buried here are: Jihn Hall (millwright and engineer); John Dunkin (antiquary and Dartford historian); James Gibson, who died in 1810 aged 106.",

To the right, the gable wall of the hall has doors which led to the buttery, pantry and kitchen, and it has a magnificent rose window. \r\n\r\nBelow the hall was a vaulted cellar, where goods such as wine could be stored, with a passage to the river wharf. The hall would have been lavishly decorated, and was often used to entertain royal guests, such as James I of Scotland and Joan Beaufort, who held their wedding feast here in 1424.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the palace was arranged around two courtyards, and housed many buildings, including a prison, brewhouse and butchery. As the Bishop's private retreat from the stresses of medieval governance, the palace also had a tennis court, bowling alley and pleasure gardens. \r\n\r\nThe palace remained in use until the 17th century, when it was divided into tenements and warehouses. The ruins were rediscovered in the 19th century following a fire, and were finally revealed in the 1980s during redevelopment of the area.",

However, this part of the meander remained a bit of a rural backwater until the first Hammersmith Bridge was built in 1827.

The station was originally named 'Acton Green' and was renamed to 'Chiswick Park' on 1 March 1910.  The original station was demolished in 1931 to accommodate the new Piccadilly line tracks, although the Piccadilly line has never served this station, and the new building opened in 1933.  The new station was designed by Charles Holden in a modern European style using brick, reinforced concrete and glass.  Similar to the station at Arnos Grove that Holden designed for the eastern Piccadilly line extension, the station's predominant feature is the tall semi-circular ticket hall.  Externally the brick walls of the ticket hall are punctuated with panels of clerestory windows and the structure is capped with a flat concrete slab roof.  To make the station's location visible from Chiswick High Road the station was also provided with a square brick tower surmounted by the roundel and the stations name.  The ticket hall once housed a central passimeter, whcih has now been replaced with the brick built ticket office accommodation which has altered the appearance of the grandiose hall.  The station was Grade II listed on 18 February 1987.",

The damage resulted in the tunnel being closed immediately for repairs to stop leaks and potential flooding. Had the tunnel been more severely damaged, the resulting closure would have had a major long-term impact on travel across the river. As the tunnel formed a much-relied-upon cross-river link connecting housing in the south and the industry and docks in the north, it was an essential part of the war effort. Preliminary repairs to stem the inflow of water were successful. By early 1941 the repairs had been completed and the tunnel fully reopened to the public. The repairs included the exposed metal ring segment lining which you can see here today.  ",

Goods wagons were pulled by horses along a track of cast iron plates laid on stone sleepers, some of which are set in the wall below. The gauge was 4'2. It opened in 1803, following the passing of the Surrey Iron Railway Act in 1801, and closed in 1846, the victim of the success of newer railways, powered by steam.",

    "inscription": "SOUTH CROXTED ROAD BUS STOP\r\nThis wooden bus shelter is an old tram stop relocated to this site in 1961. Its installation was a part of a much wider negotiation between the Dulwich Estate and the London Borough of Camberwell about new Council Housing sites.\r\nEarly in 1960 the tenant in the old house at 110 Alleyn Road, Mrs Edwards, agreed to give up the land from her garden in return for a five-year extension on her lease (the house now on the site dates from the mid-1970s). The Dulwich Estate meeting minutes say that the land will be given to Camberwell at no cost but that the Council would be responsible for the payment of all paving charges, legal cost, surveyors fees, and the cost of setting back and reconstructing the fences. Unfortunately, there is no mention of the shelter itself or where it came from.\r\nA deed dedicating \"a piece of land fronting No 110 Alleyn Road, for use as a bus draw-in and shelter\" was signed in November 1960. The shelter and its site now belongs to Southwark, which incorporated the Borough of Camberwell in 1965. The Dulwich Society secured CGS funding in 2005 and 2015 to repair the shelter. This work is now complete.\r\n\r\nAlthough there had been some development on the west side of the southern end of South Croxted Road as far as Church Parade in the 1880s, the road's extension as far as the Park Hall shops had to wait for the demolition of the old 'Manor House'. The grounds of this historic 18th Century house occupied the area between Alleyn Road and Clive Road. Edward Van Vliet, a builder from South Norwood who had acquired the 'Manor House Estate' in 1890, built the final section of the road in 1897-98. The road was not made up (tarmaced) until just before the First World War and the Camberwell Vestry were obliged to water it regularly in the summer to keep the dust down. The water carts were kept under the viaduct arches off Burbage Road.\r\n\r\nHistoric postcards confirm that there were unnumbered horse drawn buses running along the road from around 1900. It seems likely that they were owned by the Thomas Tilling bus company, who had a large stable nearby in Gipsy Road at the rear of the Paxton Hotel. The route was probably from Crystal Palace to Herne Hill and Brixton. Tillings were beginning to run motor buses from 1904 but there is no record of when they started to use them in South Croxted Road.\r\n\r\nThere was no bus regulation at that time - anyone could set up a bus company, and moor buses effectively offered a much lower cost entry to bus operation than horse drawn ones. Bus drivers, known as 'pirates' used to compete with each other to pick up passengers and, unsurprisingly, it resulted in some aggressive, and dangerous, driving. Several residents raised the problem with the Dulwich Estate through 1912 and a January 1914 letter to the Times sums it up very well. Headed \"TRAFFIC NUISANCE - INVASION OF DULWICH\", the letter pointed out the \"potential serious injury to health and property caused by the rapid passage of heavy motor traffic\" and went on to say \"This suburb has recently been invaded by the motor-omnibus, and from morning till night the houses are shaken to their foundations.' \r\n\r\nAt the beginning of November 1908, the daily unnumbered route operating between Brixton Station and South Croydon, which ran along South Croxted Road, was allocated route number 3. Later in the month the route was extended to run between Oxford Circus and the Swan & Sugar Loaf at South Croydon. From April 1909 it was extended as far as Purley on Sundays. There were a number of route changes between 1910 and World War One and, in August 1914, it was extended from Crystal Palace to Upper Norwood. By 1918, the bus ran from Camden Town to Crystal Palace. In December 1924, when the London-Traffic Act created a new system of route numbering etc on London buses, the 3 was joined by the 3A, which stopped at Brixton. The latter was withdrawn in 1934 only to re-appear just before the outbreak World War Two, when-route 3 was replaced on Sundays by a new 3A route, running from Crystal Palace to Oxford Circus and on to Mill Hill and Edgware station. This was withdrawn on 15 October 1939 as a wartime economy. Route 3 returned to 7-day operation and remained virtually unchanged until relatively recently when, because of increasing traffic and concerns over traffic pollution, the northern part of the route was reduced in length it now runs from Crystal Palace to Trafalgar Square.\r\n\r\nThis information sign was erected by the Dulwich Society in 2018. The support of the Mary Boast fund is gratefully acknowledged. Further information is available on the Society's Website\r\nwww.dulwichsociety.com",
