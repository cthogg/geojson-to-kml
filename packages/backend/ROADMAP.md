## ROADMAP:

- Get a script to take in a list of listed building numbers and output a file with the data.
- The file should be JSON file.
- Should output also the list file to the /frontend repo.

- Also to output the KML file too with the appropriate links to the pages.
- Add documentation.
- Output the data to an artifact?.
- Get the simple data to google maps.
- Get a link to wikipedia for each blue plaque /place of interest. Should then probably save the link in the database /external one. See the thing which I have removed in the commit.
- Try and make the description and title more interesting with appropriate formatting.
- Try and get pictures and make it more exciting.
- Perhaps, perhaps?? Make a SQLite or postgres database to store the data.
- Postgres is probably better for geo data compared to SQLite... but SQLite is easier to use.
