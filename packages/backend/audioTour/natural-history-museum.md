Welcome! You're standing before one of London's most magnificent Victorian buildings - the Natural History Museum. Look at its stunning cathedral-like entrance with those two soaring 58-meter towers topped with spires. The entire building is clothed in beautiful buff and blue terracotta, featuring intricate carvings of animals and plants. Notice how the extinct species are carved on the east wing, while living creatures adorn the west. The grand entrance has a pair of round-arched doors, and above them you'll see detailed animal carvings and five round-arched windows. It's a perfect example of German Romanesque architecture, designed by Alfred Waterhouse in 1881.
