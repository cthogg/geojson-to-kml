Welcome to the Vestry House Museum, a beautifully preserved historic building in the heart of Walthamstow. This former parish workhouse, dating back to 1730, now serves as a local history museum.

As you look at the building, notice the striking plum brick exterior with red dressings, giving it a distinctive appearance. The two-story south facade features a central main entrance with an inscribed plaque above it, flanked by five bays of segmental-headed windows with flush frames and 12-paned sashes.

The moulded timber eaves cornice adds a touch of elegance to the roofline, which features a tiled hipped double-pitched roof with pantiles on the northern extension. The north wing is lower in height and has a doorcase imported from the nearby Church Hill House, with its intricate waterleaf capitals and arched entryway.

As you step inside, take a moment to admire the original turned baluster staircase and the simple yet well-preserved paneling in the entrance hall, which includes a 17th-century mantelpiece and other imported period features.

This building seamlessly blends its historical character with its current role as a museum, providing a fascinating glimpse into Walthamstow's past.

The building became a museum in 1931.<ref name=WalthamForestCouncil /><ref name="WalthamForestGuardian">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian-series.co.uk/news/13652020.Museum_s_dark_past_as_parish_workhouse_unveiled/|title=Museum's dark past as parish workhouse unveiled|last=Glanvill|first=Natalie|date=8 September 2015|access-date=23 September 2018|publisher=Waltham Forest Guardian}}</ref>
