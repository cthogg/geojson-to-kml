Brick, stuccoed to street frontage. Roof concealed behind shallow parapet.PLAN. Narrow frontage incorporates deep side corridor plan leading to separate bars to right hand side and to rear, the servery on the right-hand side connecting the different areas.EXTERIOR. Five storeys, three bays, with entrances to left and right flanked by red granite pilasters with larvikite bases and terminations.and with curved timber and glass frontage between. Windows to second, third and fourth floors flanked by flat pilasters and sub-Corinthian columns. Moulded imposts to the fifth floor window pilasters; over the fifth floor windows, tympana with vermiculated detail in the centre. Plain parapet.INTERIOR. Left side wall to corridor with mahogany panelling, pilasters and mirrors with etched and polished details of urns, cornucopias, swags and foliage. On right, similarly decorated glass in a screen delineating three separate drinking areas. Over the entrance to each is a broken pediment. Between these openings, similarly detailed screens, and a doorway in the screen between the two front bars. Contemporary bar counter with panelled and flat pilasters. Bar back altered in lower parts; one section canted forward with doors and etched and polished glass and with a clock over. Further towards the rear the bar back has a broad section with a segmental pediment and carved frieze. Large rear room  with walling incorporating panelling and mirrors. Cased iron columns interrupt the bar counter at two points. Richly decorated Lincrusta ceiling throughout. Staircase to first floor with ornate, scrolled ironwork balustrade. Modestly decorated cast-iron balusters to staircase from first to second floor.A  mid-C19, metropolitan mid-terrace public house, remodelled during the great public house boom at the turn of the century. The little altered plan form with its separate drinking areas and the associated high-quality wood and glass work is a remarkable and rare survival, thought to be the best surviving example of the plan type to retain its c.1900 fittings.Source: T.

Architect A Beresford Pite. Builders Foster & Dicksee of Rugby.  Carved stonework by Farmer & Brindley.  Roof extended 1913 by Pite; extended to rear and to N in 1923, again by Pite. The extension to the west (Nos. 194-8 Euston Road), added in 1932 by WH Gunton, does not form part of this listing.     \n\n                    \n\n\n    \n        Reasons for Designation\n    \n    \n        No. 30 Euston Square is designated at Grade II* for the following principal reasons:\n*     Architectural interest: a distinctive Edwardian office building designed in a scholarly and inventive Greek manner\n*     Authorship: a major work by the distinguished architect A Beresford Pite\n*     Materials and craftsmanship: fine-quality stonework with carved decoration by Farmer & Brindley, the noted firm of architectural sculptors; elaborate ironwork \n*     Interiors: the entrance hall is one of the most remarkable tiled interiors in an Edwardian commercial building; good office fittings, chimneypieces and stairs; extensive survival of tiled finishes\n*     The 1923 extension, also by Pite, is a carefully considered adjunct to the earlier block, with the same high-quality stonework and ironwork\n  \n\n    \n\n                    \n\n\n        \n            History\n        \n        \n            This was the national headquarters of the London Edinburgh & Glasgow Assurance Company, which specialised in welfare insurance for low-income workers and their families.  The LE&GAC became part of the National Amalgamated Approved Society in 1912, a joint venture by a number of assurance societies, after which the building became the NAAS headquarters.  Welfare insurance companies became obsolete following the National Insurance Act (1946) and the advent of the National Health Service (1948), after which the building was acquired by the Government as the premises of the Ministry of National Insurance, and subsequently the Department of Health & Social Security.  The LE&GAC building is regarded as the first and only scholarly building in the Greek style since the work of CR Cockerell (1788-1863), and considered to be one of the most important works of the distinguished architect Arthur Beresford Pite (1861-1934).  It was intended as the first stage of a much larger scheme with a long elevation in Euston Road, but Pite was not retained to complete the last phase, built in 1932 to the design of WH Gunton (Nos 194-198 Euston Road).  \n        \n        \n            Details\n        \n        \n            MATERIALS: Load bearing Portland stone and brick masonry; steel and concrete floors; slate roofs; windows steel or timber casements.PLAN:  Comprises a long rectangular block facing E into Euston Square and Melton Street with a short S return into Euston Road, and a deep rear wing on the N side forming an L-plan.  The internal plan comprises an entrance hall to the S leading through to a large open L-plan office.  The first floor has a board room above the entrance hall, followed by a series of offices along a corridor, and an open-plan office in the rear wing.  The floors above have open-plan offices.  The attic, which originally contained a club room, dining room and a caretaker's flat, is now open plan. There are 3 stairs: at the rear of the entrance hall serving the Euston Road entrance, with a lift and spiral stair adjacent; in the N entrance bay, and in the SW corner of the rear wing. EXTERIOR: Four storeys, attic and basement, with rusticated ground floor, an enriched band between ground and first floors and a bracketed cornice at attic level. The front (E) elevation of 1906-8 has 9 principal bays arranged 3-3-3, plus a recessed entrance bay to the N.  The piers to the ground-floor flanking bays break forward to form pedestals supporting a giant order of attached fluted Ionic columns in the Bassae order (derived from the interior of the Temple of Apollo Epicurius at Bassae), carrying an entablature breaking forward above the columns.  Second-floor windows have roundels on aprons and a moulded band beneath; those to third floor have pediments with keystones.  The main entrance in the penultimate bay to the south has a porch with square granite pillars supporting an enriched frieze and segmental hood, and upswept wrought-iron gates attached to piers with cast-iron wreath hinges.  The three central bays have paired windows to each bay; those at first and second floors divided by giant order of Ionic columns and set within a moulded frame, with cornice above.  The third floor has tripartite windows divided by Ionic columns, flanked by pilasters.  The S return to Euston Road is similar to the flanking bays of the main elevation except that the columns support a straight entablature and a pediment, and the first-floor windows have cast-iron balconies.  Entrance has glazed timber door with iron grilles.  The attic storey, originally rising above the outer flanking bays only, is in the form of an open loggia with Ionic columns.  Stonework details are derived from Greek stele heads, sarcophagi and other sepulchral monuments.  Above the central bays are three triangular gables, added 1913, each with a Serliana.  The N entrance bay has a slightly bowed porch with plain transom and mullion detail, and glazed timber doors with iron grilles.  Above, a round-arched recess rises through two floors, with Diocletian windows at top and bottom, and a mezzanine window with paired round arches separated by an Ionic half-column. This bay terminates with a complex attic feature with three small rectangular windows, a tiny Diocletian window and plain transoms and mullions.     The 1923 extension, also designed in the Greek idiom, is 3 storeys plus a set-back attic and a mansard roof.  Façade of 2 bays, with pilastered ground-floor windows; upper-floor windows are set under broken pediments with stylised Ionic drops to the upper floors, separated by roundel spandrel panels. INTERIOR: The entrance hall has a glazed timber lobby in the form of a kiosk with canted sides (glazing replaced), antifixae and an urn finial.  The walls and ceiling are lavishly finished in green and cream Doulton Parian ware tiles with moulded relief patterns, the ceiling has elongated console brackets.  The elaborate tiled chimneypiece has a black marble moulded surround and black and white tiled slips and fireback; the overmantel has three roundels with the arms of London, Edinburgh and Glasgow, surmounted by a stylised Greek entablature and pediment with antefixae. The black and white mosaic floor is laid out in grid pattern with large central roundel of guilloches containing the 12 signs of the zodiac, in centre of which a roundel of letters reads \"Founded Anno Domini MDCCCLXXXI\" encircling the intertwined initials LEG'.  A black marble wall tablet records names of company members who fell in the Great War.  A pair of arches leads through to the office, which has a beamed plaster ceiling supported on series of paired arches clad in green and white relief tiles, similar to entrance hall.  The walls are clad in brown and dark yellow tiles to dado height, and cream and yellow tiles above. The first-floor offices have oak panelled doors with pedimented architraves.  The board room has three-quarter height oak panelling, a coffered plaster ceiling and ribbed frieze, and a handsome chimneypiece in the Greek style with white marble surround and yellow and black marble slips, by Farmer & Brindley.  Windows are set into arched recesses.  Two other offices have oak chimneypieces. There are glazed doors to either end of the corridor. The rear wing has green and cream tiled piers and brown tiled dados, matching those to ground floor office; the third floor also has these features.  The attic storey has no original features except for one fireplace. The S stair has a closed string, carved drop finials, heavy handrail and turned balusters, and unusual newel posts in form of fluted obelisks.  The inner string has brown and yellow tiling.  The N stair has a close string and elongated finials with rounded caps, and triangular stick balusters set in groups of three; the SW stair has a simple handrail attached to the wall; both stairwells are clad in bands of banded brown and cream glazed bricks.  The N extension has no interior features of interest. SUBSIDIARY FEATURES: Elaborate iron railings with Ionic column piers on low plinth.  Euston Road entrance has stone gate piers with anthemion heads and iron gates of similar design to the main entrance porch; gates also to N entrance.

    "wikipedia_text": "30 Euston Square is a building located at the corner of Euston Road and Melton Street, London NW1.  Originally built as the headquarters of an assurance company, it has since been converted to form the headquarters of the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP).  Its architectural style is Greek Revival.  The first phase, built in 1906–08, was designed by Arthur Beresford Pite, and the 1932 extension is by W. H. Gunton.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe original part of the building, with the address 1–9 Melton Street, was constructed in 1906–08 as the headquarters of the London, Edinburgh and Glasgow Assurance Company to a design by Arthur Beresford Pite.  In 1910 the insurance company became part of the Pearl Life Assurance Company, which was one of the initial members of the National Amalgamated Approved Society (NAAS). in 1913 Pite extended the roof of the building, and in 1923 he made a further extension to the north end of the building.  The final phase of the building, with the address 194–198 Euston Road, was built in 1932 on the south side of the original building; this was designed by W. H. Gunton. The building continued to be the headquarters of the NAAS until approved societies were abolished under the terms of the National Insurance Act 1946.  From 1948 it was owned by the government, and subsequently served a number of purposes, including being a local office of the Department of Health and Social Security*.  It was transferred to private ownership in the 1990s, but was virtually unused from that time.  It was later acquired by the RCGP, and refurbished to act as their headquarters. It opened for this purpose in late October 2012.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe original building is constructed in load-bearing Portland stone and brick masonry, with slate roofs; the 1932 extension is steel framed with stone cladding. The original building, facing Melton Street, is in four storeys with an attic and basement, the ground floor being rusticated.  It is in Greek Revival style, the main front being decorated with a type of Ionic column derived from those at the Temple of Apollo Epicurius at Bassae. The 1932 extension is also in Greek Revival style. The entrance hall is decorated internally with green and cream Doulton Parian Ware tiles.  The parts of the building designed by Pite were designated as a Grade II* listed building on 14 May 1974, but Gunton's extension is excluded from the listing.\n\n\n== Present day ==\nSince coming under the ownership of the RCGP, the entire building has been given the address of 30 Euston Square.  Its internal conversion has been carried out to make as little alteration as possible to the 1906–08 phase of the building.  The main changes have been in the 1932 phase, where examination suites and study-bedrooms have been created. Other facilities include a 300-seat auditorium with an exhibition area, meeting rooms, private dining rooms and state rooms with a rooftop terrace.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External Sites ==\nOfficial 30 Euston Square website"

On its consecration in\n          1852 the Ecclesiologist described it as \"the most artistically\n          correct new church yet consecrated in London\". Norman Shaw \n          worshipped here for 42 years and described it as \"the beau\n          ideal of a town church\".\n          (The Builder: 11 August 1855: 372; The Builder: 28 July 1858:\n          354-5; The Builder: 3 November 1866: 818; The Builder: 1 March\n          1884: 322; Thomas E Sedgwick, with J T Micklethwaite, R Norman\n          Shaw et al.: Description and History of the Church of St Mary\n          Magdalene: London: -1902; Survey of London: Vol. XXI,       \n          Tottenham Court Road and Neighbourhood, St Pancras III:     \n          London: -1949: 140).

    "wikipedia_text": "St Christopher's Chapel is the chapel of Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, England. It is a grade II* listed building and is noted for its highly decorated interior.\n\n\n== History ==\nGreat Ormond Street Hospital was built from 1871 to 1876, and the chapel was completed in 1875. It had been designed by Edward Middleton Barry who donated his work to the hospital in memory of one of his children who had died in infancy. The chapel cost £60,000 to build. The chapel is a small rectangle with an apse at its east end. Its interior is highly decorated. The chapel was consecrated on 18 November 1875 by Canon Alfred Barry, later Bishop of Sydney and Primate of Australia.\nOn 10 March 1980, the chapel was designated a grade II* listed building.\nDue to its listed status, the chapel could not be demolished when the old hospital building was knocked down in the 1980s. It was decided that the whole chapel would be moved to a new site. This was done by encasing the chapel in a large, water-proof box and underpinning with a concrete raft. Having emptied the interior of all its furniture and removed the stained-glass windows, the now encased chapel was lowered from the first floor to the ground floor. It was then moved by hydraulic rams to its new location; this is \"thought to be the largest en bloc transportation of a structure ever undertaken\". Six years after it was moved and after extensive renovation, the chapel was re-opened on 14 February 1994 by Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\n\n=== Present ===\n\nThe chapel is open at all times. There is a service of morning prayer at 10:30 am Monday to Friday and a service of Holy Communion on Wednesdays.\nAlong the rear of the chapel is a row of teddy bears and other soft toys, provided by families of ill children, known as the Teddy Bear Choir. In addition, the chapel has a prayer tree where messages of hope and support can be written for sick children at the hospital and placed on the tree.\n\n\n== Interior ==\n\nThe chapel has been described as of the Franco-Italianate style and was influenced by the Renaissance Revival. The chapel \"is divided by four columns, and has a central dome, with an apse at the east end\". The terrazzo floor was designed by Antonio Salviati, an Italian mosaicist, and is said to be influenced by a pavement in St Mark's Basilica, Venice.\nThe interior is highly decorated with many of its images referring to childhood. The central dome is \"painted with musician angels around the rim and pelican in piety\" in its centre. The apse windows are stained glass designed by Clayton and Bell, and depict the childhood of Jesus Christ. The ceiling of the apse is decorated with eight angels (Faith, Truth, Patience, Purity, Obedience, Charity, Honour and Hope) with a central roundel depicting the Lamb and flag.\nThere are a number of Bible quotes with accompanying murals decorating the walls. These include \"Suffer little children to come unto me\" (Luke 18:16) and \"feed my lambs + feed my sheep\" (John 21:16). Above the door it states: \"I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the House of the Lord\" (Psalm 122:1).\n\n\n== Memorials ==\nThere are a number of memorial plaques on the walls of the chapel. They include:\n\nSir James Matthew Barrie, 1st Baronet (1860–1937), novelist and playwright, author of Peter Pan. He gave the copyright to the Peter Pan works to Great Ormond Street Hospital in 1929.\nWilliam Henry Barry (1823–1880), who endowed the chapel\nCharles Dickens, author and early fundraiser for the hospital.\nLt Col Alexander Simpson-Smith, RAMC (1900–1942). He was a surgeon at the hospital but volunteered for the British Army during the Second World War. He died in 1942 while serving in Egypt.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nGreat Ormond Street Hospital chaplaincy"

    "wikipedia_text": "Freemasons' Hall in London is the headquarters of the United Grand Lodge of England and the Supreme Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons of England, as well as being a meeting place for many Masonic Lodges in the London area. It is located in Great Queen Street between Holborn and Covent Garden and has been a Masonic meeting place since 1775. \nParts of the building are open to the public daily, and its preserved classic Art Deco style, together with its regular use as a film and television location, have made it a tourist destination.\nIn 1846, the World Evangelical Alliance was founded here.\n\n\n== Original concept ==\nIn 1775 the premier Grand Lodge purchased a house fronting the street, behind which was a garden and a second house. A competition was held for the design of a Grand Hall to link the two houses. The front house was the Freemasons' Tavern, the back house was to become offices and meeting rooms. The winning design was by Thomas Sandby.\n\n\n== Current building ==\n\nThe current building, the third on this site, was built between 1927 and 1933 in the Art Deco style to the designs of architects Henry Victor Ashley and F. Winton Newman as a memorial to the 3,225 Freemasons who died on active service in World War I.\nIt is an imposing Art Deco building, covering two and a quarter acres (0.9 ha). Initially known as the Masonic Peace Memorial, the name was changed to Freemasons' Hall at the outbreak of the World War II in 1939. The financing for building the hall was raised by the Masonic Million Memorial Fund. This fund raised over £1 million. It is a Grade II* listed building, both internally and externally. \n\n\n== Points of interest ==\n\n\n=== Grand Temple ===\n\nCentral to the present building is the Grand Temple, meeting place for Grand Lodge, Grand Chapter  and a majority of the lodges in the Metropolitan Grand Lodge of London, as well as the annual meetings of a number of the Home Counties Provincial Grand Lodges, and for other Masonic degrees and orders to hold their annual meetings.\nMany non-Masonic organisations also use the Grand Temple for numerous events as diverse as Fashion shows and Polytechnic award ceremonies. Bronze doors, designed by Walter Gilbert each weighing one and a quarter tonnes, open on to a Chamber 123 feet (37 m) long, 90 feet (27 m) wide and 62 feet (19 m) high capable of seating 1,700.\nThe ceiling cove is of Mosaic work and in addition to figures and symbols from Masonic ritual includes, in the corner, figures representing the four cardinal virtues – Prudence, Temperance, Fortitude, and Justice – and the Arms of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn (second youngest son of Queen Victoria) Grand Master 1901–1939, at whose suggestion the Masonic Peace Memorial was built. \nA large pipe organ, built by leading organ builders Henry Willis & Sons, was installed in 1933. Some 80 years later it was restored by Harrison and Harrison of Durham, the work being funded by the Supreme Grand Chapter. The restoration was completed in 2015, and included the provision of a new \"Grand\" section of the instrument housed in a matching new case immediately behind and above the console, thus creating three structures in place of the original two. The inaugural recital on the restored instrument was given on 30 September 2015 by Dr Thomas Trotter, organist of Birmingham Town Hall and St Margaret's, Westminster.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Other Temples ===\n\nIn addition to the Grand Temple, there are a further 26 masonic temples (formal lodge meeting rooms) within the building, used by Lodges and Chapters. All are highly ornate in their various art deco styles, and no two are identical. Amongst the temples which are of particular note, Temple No 1 was very large (seating up to 600) and contained a series of portraits of former Grand Masters. However, the temple was converted into a conference space, by removing the furnishings and Willis pipe organ (though the portraits remain).\nTemple No 3, although of no unusual style in itself, contains a nineteenth-century chamber organ of note (fully restored around 2012); Temple No 10 (where the designers had additional height and space due to its location beneath the large clock tower) is built in a style which combines classic art deco with Egyptian design, and includes an impressive high domed ceiling, and also a Willis pipe organ (awaiting restoration); Temple No 11 was largely funded by donations from Japan and the Far East, and is consequently decorated in a lavish style, dominated by stylised Chrysanthemums, the national flower of Japan; Temple No 12 is known as the Burma Temple for similar reasons, and is decorated with stylised Burmese artwork, and a plaque recording the contributions of Freemasons from British Burma.\nTemple No 16 has a distinctive and highly decorated barrel vault ceiling; Temple No 17 was largely funded by the Freemasons of Buckinghamshire, and has a very large carved swan (the symbol of Buckinghamshire) on one wall; it also enjoys a more than usually ornate decorative style, with extensive oak panelling, and is used in particular by the most ancient lodges in London, including the three remaining lodges (of four originals) which pre-date 1717 and the formation of the Grand Lodge itself; until 2018, Temple No 23 was the smallest (seating approximately 35 people) and contained a series of portraits of former Grand Secretaries, but in that year this temple was renamed \"The Kent Room\" and made available for public examination as part of the Library and Museum of Freemasonry (although it can also still be used for lodge meetings); at the same time, three brand new small temples were created (with a capacity of around 20 people in each), numbered as Temples 25, 26, and 27, as provision for meetings of very small Lodges; these new temples were created out of space that was formerly two residential flats, as the number of residential staff living in the building has greatly reduced.\nIn addition to these 26 Temples, and the Grand Temple, there are several very simple and plain temples reserved for 'Lodges of Instruction' and 'Lodges of Rehearsal'. Unlike the Grand Temple and the Kent Room (of which public tours are available daily) the other temples (and the rehearsal temples) are not normally open to the public, as they are in constant demand by private London Lodges and Chapters for their regular meetings. Approximately 1800 lodges and chapters meet regularly in London, and a high proportion of these meet at Freemasons' Hall.\n\n\n=== Museum of Freemasonry ===\n\nThe Museum of Freemasonry is a museum, library and archive based in Freemasons' Hall covering Freemasonry and other fraternal orders. The Museum is a Charitable Trust registered with the Charity Commission (Registered Charity number 1058497).\nIn 2007 the collection of the Museum of Freemasonry was recognised through the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council’s Designation Scheme as being of outstanding quality and significance and of national and international importance.\nThe Museum is open to the general public and entry is free of charge. The Museum has a collection of Masonic artworks, ceremonial objects and regalia, as well as everyday objects with Masonic decoration, including clocks, furniture, glassware, jewellery, porcelain, pottery and silver. \nThe Library is open to the public for reference use and users are required to register. The Library contains a comprehensive collection of printed books and manuscripts on every facet of Freemasonry in England, as well as material on Freemasonry elsewhere in the world, and on subjects associated with Freemasonry or with mystical and esoteric traditions, including the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia archives. The Library catalogue is available online. In addition to its core Masonic collections, The Museum of Freemasonry holds a wide selection of items relating to Friendly Societies such as the Oddfellows, Foresters and many other societies both current and no longer in existence. A large collection of Friendly Societies books, especially relating to the Oddfellows and the Foresters, are also held by the Library.\nThe Museum provides a genealogical enquiry service. However, there is no complete alphabetical index of Freemasons publicly available. \nThe Museum of Freemasonry also presents workshops, events, and a major thematic exhibition, as well as several smaller exhibitions during the course of the year. Admission to all exhibitions is free.\n\n\n=== Other facilities ===\n\nIn addition to the Grand Temple, the other temples, and the Library and Museum, the building contains extensive administrative offices, storage space for the property of the many hundreds of lodges meeting in the building, a masonic shop (open to the public during normal trading hours), board rooms, workshops, archives, a café-bar and an entire floor of charities administration, where the combined masonic charities have their administration.\nThe Metropolitan Grand Lodge of London is also administered from the building. It has around 40,000 Freemasons as members, which makes it the largest of the Masonic provinces. \n\n\n=== Architectural fittings ===\nThroughout the building Robert Adams (Victor) range of floor springs are used to control the doors, including the \"Sceptre Victor.\" Windows are also controlled by Robert Adams geared fan light operators.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIn 2016, a part of the film Assassin's Creed was filmed in the Grand Temple. Re-labeled as \"The Grand Templar Hall\", the Temple is used as the antagonist's location for his award ceremony towards the end of the film. The Hall is seen sporting double Templar Crosses on the facade of the Temple.\nLike Sandby's Grand Hall, the Grand Temple is also used for concerts and musical events – having excellent acoustics and clear sight-lines. In September 2014, Freemasons' Hall hosted several fashion shows as a part of London Fashion Week 2014.\nThe building is used both internally and externally as a stand-in for Thames House (the home of MI5) in the TV series Spooks and in the TV series Spy and has also featured extensively in the long-running series of TV films Agatha Christie's Poirot. The building makes frequent one-off appearances in episodes of other television series, such as its extensive use in Hustle, series 5, episode 2. Both its exterior and interior were used in an episode of New Tricks, and the interior has been used for the film adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy where Freemasons' Hall becomes the temple in which the \"Jatravartid\" people pray for \"the coming of the Great White Handkerchief\". It has also been used in many other feature films, including Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London, The Wings of the Dove, Johnny English, Sherlock Holmes, and the television adaptation of The Line of Beauty. The building has also featured as a backdrop in music videos, including extensive use (internally and externally) in the music video for Westlife's cover of Mandy.\nThe 2013 crypto-thriller The Sword of Moses by Dominic Selwood has numerous scenes set in Freemasons' Hall.\nIn 2022 The Late Late Show with James Corden filmed four episodes in Freemasons' Hall for a London week.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFreemasonry\nMark Masons' Hall, London\nList of Masonic libraries\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nHistory of Freemasons' Hall\nWebsite of the Museum of Freemasonry"

    "wikipedia_text": "Congress House is the headquarters of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), a British organisation that represents most of the UK's trade unions. It is also an events venue, Congress Centre.\nIn 1948, David du Roi Aberdeen won an architectural competition to design the new TUC headquarters building in Great Russell Street, London. Staff began to move into the offices in 1956. Congress House was officially opened on 27 March 1958 along with the unveiling of a giant pietà-style statue of a woman holding her dead son. Carved in place in the internal courtyard by Jacob Epstein, it was intended as a memorial to the dead trade unionists of both world wars.\nThe front of the building is dominated by a bronze sculpture by Bernard Meadows representing the spirit of trade unionism with the strong helping the weak. The main facing material of the façade is polished grey Cornish granite.\nCongress House was one of the earliest post-war buildings to be listed, at Grade II*, in 1988.\nIn 2015, an ETFE roof was installed over the internal courtyard which enabled the glass roof of the conference centre below to be reinstated and affords protection to the Epstein statue.\nIn 2018, an extensive redevelopment of the rear of the building was carried out, creating a new entrance, reception, offices and staff facilities. Known as 'The Rookery', the new development includes a public artwork by German artist Eva Berendes inspired by traditional trade union badges.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Congress House, Great Russell Street, London at Wikimedia Commons\n\nTUC's webpage with details of the history of the building"

    "wikipedia_text": "The London Palladium () is a Grade II* West End theatre located on Argyll Street, London, in Soho. The theatre was designed by Frank Matcham and opened in 1910. The auditorium holds 2,286 people. Hundreds of stars have played there, many with televised performances. Between 1955 and 1969 Sunday Night at the London Palladium was staged at the venue, produced for the ITV network. The show included a performance by the Beatles on 13 October 1963; one newspaper's headlines in the following days coined the term \"Beatlemania\" to describe the hysterical interest in the band.\nWhile the theatre hosts resident shows, it is also able to host one-off performances, such as concerts, TV specials and Christmas pantomimes. It has hosted the Royal Variety Performance 43 times, most recently in 2019.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nWalter Gibbons, an early moving-pictures manager, intended for the Palladium, in 1910, to compete with Sir Edward Moss's London Hippodrome and Sir Oswald Stoll's London Coliseum. The facade (on the site of Argyll House, demolished in the 1860s, from which the pub opposite took the name The Argyll Arms), dates back to the 19th century. Formerly it was a temporary wooden building called Corinthian Bazaar, which featured an aviary and aimed to attract customers from the recently closed Pantheon Bazaar (now the site of Marks & Spencers) in Oxford Street. The theatre was rebuilt a year later by Fredrick Hengler, the son of a tightrope walker, as a circus arena for entertainments that included promenade concerts, pantomimes and an aquatic display in a flooded ring. It then became the National Skating Palace – a skating rink with real ice. However, the rink failed and the Palladium was redesigned by Frank Matcham, a famous theatrical architect who also designed the Coliseum, on the site that had previously housed Hengler's Circus.\nThe theatre retains many of its original features and was Grade II* listed in September 1960. The building now carries Heritage Foundation commemorative plaques honouring Lew Grade and Frankie Vaughan.\nThe Palladium had its own telephone system so the occupants of boxes could call one another. It also had a revolving stage.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1910 to 1928 ===\nThe theatre started out as The Palladium, a premier venue for variety performances. Pantomimes were also featured there. In 1926, the pantomime starred Lennie Dean as Cinderella, of which footage has survived. The theatre is especially linked to the Royal Variety Performances, where many were, and still are, held. In 1928, for three months the Palladium also ran as a cinema. Following this 'cine-variety' episode the theatre fell dark for a short period in the autumn of 1928.\n\n\n=== The George Black era ===\nFrom 3 September 1928, the Palladium reopened under the directorship of the impresario/producer George Black as part of the General Theatre Corporation (GTC). When Black took control the theatre was close to bankruptcy. He revived its fortunes by returning to the original ethos of the Palladium by staging large variety shows, with a capital 'V' – and as well as headlining Britain's homegrown acts he brought over big American stars such as Duke Ellington and his Orchestra (on 12 June 1933, his first ever concert hall performance), Adelaide Hall, Louis Armstrong and Ethel Waters for two-week engagements. Before too long, under Black's management the Palladium was soon gaining praise again as 'The World's Leading Variety Theatre'. In 1935, Black initiated the Crazy Gang revues at the Palladium (for which he is chiefly remembered) with Life Begins at Oxford Circus. The revues continued at the Palladium as an annual event until they transferred to the Victoria Palace theatre in 1940. Black managed the Palladium until his death in 1945.\nThe climax of the 1935 Alfred Hitchcock spy thriller The 39 Steps was filmed at the Palladium.\n\n\n==== Second World War ====\nThe theatre was hit by an unexploded German parachute mine on 11 May 1941. The device had fallen through the roof, becoming lodged over the stage. A Royal Navy bomb disposal team was sent to deal with it. After the mine was located, the fuse locking ring had to be turned to allow access to the fuse itself. Rather disconcertingly, the fuse began ticking as soon as it was touched. This caused a rapid evacuation of the immediate area, but the mine did not detonate. The two team members cautiously returned, extracted the fuse and removed other hazardous components, rendering the mine 'safe'. It was then lowered to the stage and disposed of. The George Medal for gallantry and undaunted devotion to duty was given to Sub Lieutenant Graham Maurice Wright for his action in the Palladium on that night. He was later killed, on 19 August 1941, while en route for Gibraltar on board the torpedoed troopship SS Aguila.\n\n\n=== The Val Parnell era ===\nVal Parnell took over as managing director after George Black's death in 1945. He adopted a controversial, but very successful, policy of presenting high-priced, big-name American acts at the top of the bill. Among many, the list included Carmen Miranda, Judy Garland, Sophie Tucker, Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney, Channing Pollock, the Andrews Sisters with Vic Schoen and his orchestra, Bob Hope, Liza Minnelli, Lena Horne, Ella Fitzgerald, Peggy Lee, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Frankie Laine and Johnnie Ray, freezing out many British stars of the day, who were relegated to second-billing.\nFrom 1955 to 1967, the theatre was the setting for the top-rated ITV Network variety show Sunday Night at the London Palladium hosted first by Tommy Trinder, followed by Bruce Forsyth, Norman Vaughan, and Jimmy Tarbuck. The programme was broadcast live every week by ATV, which was owned by the famous theatrical impresario Lew Grade. Production was by Val Parnell. Six programmes aired as special episodes in the United States between May and August 1966 on NBC. British stars on the show included Cliff Richard and the Shadows, Petula Clark, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. The Beatles' publicist, Tony Barrow, said that after the band's first appearance on the show on 13 October 1963, Beatlemania took off in the UK. Their performance was watched by 15 million viewers. One national paper's headlines in the following days coined the term \"Beatlemania\" to describe the phenomenal and increasingly hysterical interest in the Beatles – and it stuck.\nParnell became associated with a property development company and began to sell Moss Empires' theatres for redevelopment. When it became known in 1966 that this fate awaited the London Palladium, The Victoria Palace and even the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, Prince Littler organised a take-over to save the theatres and Val Parnell retired to live in France. The new managing director of Stoll-Moss was Louis Benjamin, who took on the role while continuing as MD of Pye Records within the ATV Group.\nBy 1965, the Wine Society was operating out of a cellar under the Palladium. Additionally, it was also using one at Joiner Street under London Bridge Station and one at St James's Bond in Rotherhithe (which flooded at high tide). In 1968, Sammy Davis Jr. starred in Golden Boy, the first book musical to be produced in the venue. A Johnny Cash album was recorded there in 1968, but Columbia Records never released it. Bootlegs of the performance are in circulation. Jose Feliciano also recorded a hit USA gold status double LP for RCA records called \"Alive Alive O!\" in April 1969\n\n\n=== Post-Parnell ===\n On 6 December 1970 Dorothy Squires gave a concert at the Palladium, recorded for an LP release the following year.\nIn January 1973, glam rock band Slade played a gig in the theatre which resulted in the venue's balcony nearly collapsing. \nIn July 1974, singer Cass Elliott performed for two weeks. 48 hours after her final performance she died in her sleep in her rented flat in Mayfair. Also in 1974, Josephine Baker performed in the Royal Variety Performance. The 1991 film The Josephine Baker Story implied that, like Cass Elliott, she died after a show there, but this is not true. She actually died in Paris four days after a show there.\nBing Crosby performed for two weeks at the Palladium starting on 21 June 1976. The resulting live album Bing Crosby Live at the London Palladium reached No. 9 in the UK album charts in November 1977.\nIn October 1976, Marvin Gaye recorded a live concert at the venue. The performance documented on the resulting double LP, entitled Live at the London Palladium and released in 1977. \nIn 1981, the cellars of the Palladium housed a waxworks museum, aptly called \"The Palladium Cellars\", headlined by a Yul Bryner live projection automaton, as the cowboy Gunslinger from Westworld.\nIn the late 1980s, the Palladium was once again the setting for the popular ITV variety show, Live From the Palladium, compered by Jimmy Tarbuck. During this time, the theatre was under the ownership of the Stoll Moss Theatres Group, and the management of Margaret and David Locke, who were both major shareholders of Stoll Moss at the time.\nIn 1988, the Edinburgh Gang Show appeared as part of the British Musical Hall Society's Silver Jubilee.\nIn 1991, a new production of the Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat opened starring Jason Donovan in the title role with Linzi Hateley as the Narrator. Phillip Schofield later replaced Donovan in the title role.\nIn 1994, Cameron Mackintosh produced a new revival of Lionel Bart's musical Oliver!, directed by Sam Mendes. It starred Jonathan Pryce as Fagin and Sally Dexter as Nancy.\nIn 1998, Arlene Phillips directed and choreographed a stage musical adaptation of Saturday Night Fever starring Adam Garcia and Ben Richards.\n\n\n=== The 21st Century & the Really Useful Group ===\n\nIn 2000, ownership of the theatre changed once again when Stoll Moss was acquired by Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group. From 3 May 2000 to 5 January 2002, the Palladium played The King and I starring Elaine Paige and Jason Scott Lee. This production was a West End transfer of the hugely successful 1996 Broadway production. Before the opening, the box office had already taken in excess of £7 million in ticket sales. This version of the show was a lavish affair, with new dialogue and music added, while the original material was updated. During the run, Josie Lawrence played the role of Anna and Paul Nakauchi and Keo Woolford played the role of the King, respectively. After the production closed, the famous (but outdated) revolving stage was removed to make way for more modern technology.\nFrom April 2002 to 4 September 2005, the Palladium hosted a theatrical version of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang with songscore by the Sherman Brothers as a successor to The King & I, directed by Adrian Noble and choreographed by Gillian Lynne. The original cast included Michael Ball, Emma Williams, Anton Rodgers, Nichola McAuliffe, Brian Blessed and Richard O'Brien. Throughout its three-and-a-half-year run at the venue, the production starred many celebrities. This show proved to be the most successful in the theatre's long history and reunited, 50 years later, the show's choreographer Gillian Lynne, with the theatre in which she had appeared as the Palladium's Star Dancer during the early 50s. \nOn 1 November 2004 and 22 November singer-songwriter Jackson Browne performed two concerts during his solo acoustic tour. For Christmas 2005–06, the venue staged Bill Kenwright's production of Scrooge – The Musical which closed on 14 January 2006. The show starred Tommy Steele, making a return to the Palladium. From February 2006, the theatre played host to a new musical production entitled Sinatra At The London Palladium, which featured a live band, large screen projections and dancers performing Frank Sinatra's greatest hits.\n\nLloyd Webber and David Ian's production of The Sound of Music opened at the Palladium in November 2006. The production ran for just over two years, before closing on 21 February 2009. It starred Connie Fisher and Summer Strallen as Maria, Simon Shepherd, Alexander Hanson and Simon MacCorkindale as Captain Von Trapp and Lesley Garrett and Margaret Preece as the Mother Abbess. A production of Sister Act the Musical opened on 2 June 2009, starring Patina Miller as Deloris, Sheila Hancock as Mother Superior, Ian Lavender as Monsignor Howard, Chris Jarman as Shank, Ako Mitchell as Eddie, Katie Rowley Jones as Sister Mary Robert, Claire Greenway as Sister Mary Patrick and Julia Sutton as Sister Mary Lazarus.\nRufus Wainwright held two sold out Judy Garland tribute concerts at the theatre on 18 and 25 February 2007. On 20 May 2007 the London Palladium hosted the 2007 BAFTA awards, which were broadcast on BBC television, and in 2010 the BAFTA Television Awards returned to the Palladium. While the Theatre has a resident show, it is still able to have one-off performances; this is enabled by the scenery of the resident show being designed to be easily removed. For example, the set of Sister Act was able to be hoisted completely above the stage out of view in an area called the Fly Loft.\nThe London Palladium turned 100 years old on Boxing Day 2010, and a one-hour television special entitled '100 Years of the Palladium' aired on BBC Two on 31 December 2010. Sir Elton John performed at the venue in September 2013 in a special show where he was presented with the Brit Awards Icon, subsequently broadcast on ITV1. Robbie Williams promoted his new album Swings Both Ways, the UK's 1000th No. 1 album, with a one-night performance on 8 November 2013 that was filmed for television broadcast (BBC One). He was joined by members of the cast of The Muppet Show (Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo, Statler and Waldorf), Lily Allen, Rufus Wainwright, his father, a children's choir and a 30-piece orchestra. Invited guests included Adele and One Direction.\nFrom 2011 to 2012, the Palladium became home to Andrew Lloyd Webber's new production of The Wizard of Oz which featured new songs by Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice and starred Michael Crawford, Danielle Hope, Hannah Waddingham, Russell Grant, Sophie Evans and Des O'Connor. This was followed by a return season of Scrooge: The Musical starring Tommy Steele. In 2013 it became home to a revival of A Chorus Line starring John Partridge, Scarlett Strallen and Leigh Zimmerman. \n\nSince 2013, excluding 2014, 2015 and 2016, Britain's Got Talent have held Judges' auditions at the Palladium as one part of their audition tour which usually lasts from mid-January to late-February.\nIn 2014, Really Useful Group split in two, and the entity owning the theatre became the Really Useful Theatres Group.

    "wikipedia_text": "The Fitzrovia Chapel is located at Pearson Square, in London's W1 area, standing in the centre of the Fitzroy Place development, bordered by Mortimer Street, Cleveland Street, Nassau Street and Riding House Street in Fitzrovia, Westminster. \nDesigned by John Loughborough Pearson , the chapel was built 1891–92 with its interior completed 32 years after his death in 1929, the works being overseen by his son Frank Loughborough Pearson (1864–1947).\nBuilt in the central courtyard of the former Middlesex Hospital, which was rebuilt in 1929–35 before being demolished in 2008–15, the hospital chapel was preserved as a Grade II* listed building and renamed as the Fitzrovia Chapel.\nThe chapel is noted for its opulent Gothic Revival-style and mosaic interior.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe building now known as the Fitzrovia Chapel was built in 1891–92 as the Middlesex Hospital Chapel. Between 1929 and 1935 the decaying 18th-century hospital building was gradually demolished and rebuilt around the chapel.\nAfter the Middlesex Hospital was amalgamated into University College Hospital, its hospital buildings other than the chapel were completely demolished 2008–15, being replaced by a new residential development. The listed structure was preserved throughout the demolition, and today the chapel stands within Pearson Square, a privately owned public space named after the chapel's architect, belonging to Jones Lang LaSalle.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe chapel is noted as a fine example of Gothic Revival architecture, designed by John Loughborough Pearson in the Italian Gothic-style. The interior of the chapel features a rib vaulted ceiling richly decorated with polychrome marble and mosaics. The mosaics were completed in the 1930s by Maurice Richard Josey, assisted by his son John Leonard Josey.\nThe ceiling mosaic depicts blue stars against a gold background representing the firmament. The wall mosaics are lined with green onyx and a zigzag pattern. In the arched chancel there is a Cosmatesque pillar piscina. Set into an ogee arch is an aumbry adorned with an image of the Pelican in her Piety carved in white marble, erected in memory of Prince Francis of Teck, younger brother of Queen Mary, who died in 1910. Set into roundels beneath the arches are sculpted busts of the Twelve Apostles and the Old Testament prophets. The organ gallery at the chapel's west end is surmounted by an arch decorated with a mosaic inscription of words from the Gloria in excelsis Deo:\n\nGLORIA IN EXCELSIS DEO ET IN TERRA PAX HOMINIBUS BONÆ VOLUNTATIS(GLORY BE TO GOD IN THE HIGHEST AND ON EARTH PEACE TO MEN OF GOODWILL)\nThe baptismal font is carved from a solid block of green marble and is adorned with the symbols of the Four Evangelists. The inscription, \"Nipson anomemata me monan opsin\", is a palindrome in Ancient Greek as inscribed on a holy water font outside the Church of Hagia Sophia, Constantinople, in medieval times:\n\nΝίψον ἀνομήματα, μὴ μόναν ὄψιν (Wash the sins, not only the face)\nUnusually, the chapel is aligned approximately on a north–south axis instead of the traditional alignment towards the liturgical east.\n\n\n=== Interior features ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notable people commemorated at the Fitzrovia Chapel ==\n\nDiana Beck, the first female neurosurgeon.\nRudyard Kipling\nPrince Francis of Teck\n\n\n== The Fitzrovia Chapel Foundation ==\nThe Fitzrovia Chapel is managed by a charity, the Fitzrovia Chapel Foundation.

    "wikipedia_text": "66 Portland Place is an office building in Marylebone in Central London, near the boundary with Fitzrovia. Located on the corner of Portland Place and Weymouth Street, it serves as the headquarters of the Royal Institute of British Architects (\"RIBA\").\n\n\n== History ==\nRIBA had been housed at 9 Conduit Street from 1859. However, the growth of the institute had necessitated a move to larger quarters, with a competition being announced in 1929 to design a new RIBA building. The commission attracted 284 entries; a high number compared to the comparative modesty of the construction, but perhaps not surprising given the building's future purpose.  The winning design was by George Grey Wornum.\nConstruction began in 1932, with the foundation stone laid on 28 June 1933 by Thomas, Lord Howard de Walden, a noted patron of the arts.  The building was officially opened on 8 November 1934 by the then King and Queen, George V and Mary.\nOn 14 September 1970, thirty-seven years after its construction, the building was listed grade II* (the second highest category in England and Wales).\nIn 2012 the Royal Institute of British Architects began a feasibility study about amending or moving out of the building. In 2024, the RIBA announced a £85 million refurbishment by Benedetti Architects, with the building due to close from 1 June 2025 for two and a half years. \n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe building is designed primarily in the Art Deco style, blended with late neoclassical (also known as Imperial Neoclassical, after the works of Sir Edwin Lutyens and Sir Herbert Baker). Externally, the Art Deco elements manifest themselves in the bronze doors, architectural motifs, and trans-storey main window.  The rustication and bay-regularity exhibit the elements of classicism.\n\n\n== References =="

The existing building represents the toleration shown to French Huguenots in England over several centuries;\n\n    \n\n                    \n\n\n        \n            History\n        \n        \n            In the late 1540s, scholars and theologians welcomed in Reformation England included John à Lasco, a reformer of Polish origin, who held services at Lambeth Palace for refugees. His project for the establishment of a reformed church for foreign worshippers met with encouragement from Archbishop Cranmer and Edward, Duke of Somerset, Lord Protector of the young Edward VI. On 24 July 1550, Edward VI signed letters patent for the foundation of the Strangers’ Church in London for those ‘banished and cast out from their own country for the sake of the Gospel of Christ’; the charter required that the appointment of ministers should be approved by the sovereign. The use of St Augustine’s Chapel in Austin Friars in the City of London was authorised. The church grew rapidly, with French, Flemish and German-speaking members. Within three months the French Huguenot congregation transferred to the chapel of St Anthony’s Hospital in Threadneedle Street, nearby. During the reign of the Catholic Mary I, services were suspended, to be resumed in 1560 following the accession of Elizabeth I; Elizabeth appointed Edmund Grindal, Bishop of London, as superintendent, allaying doubts about the wisdom of allowing a freedom of worship to a foreign church. In 1572, the Massacre of St Bartholomew’s Day and the persecution of Protestants which followed brought a new wave of refugees, who were received by the French churches established at London, Canterbury, Norwich, Southampton, Rye and Winchelsea. During the C17 pressure was exerted on the French churches to conform with the Church of England, particularly by Archibishop Laud; though some churches did adopt a translation of the English Book of Common Prayer, the Threadneedle Street church retained its constitution and service. In 1685, the revocation of the 1598 Edict of Nantes, which had allowed some freedom of worship to Protestants, led to the flight of about half a million Huguenots, with between 40,000 and 50,000 arriving in Britain. In London, numerous French churches were established, mainly in those areas with large Huguenot populations. The principal church serving Spitalfields, home to a community of weavers, was Threadneedle Street, whilst Westminster, where Huguenots included tailors, goldsmiths, silversmiths, gunmakers and watchmakers, was principally served by the conformist Savoy Church. The Great Fire of London of 1666 destroyed the Threadneedle Street church, which was one of the first churches to be rebuilt, opening for worship in 1669. By the early C18 there were more than 30 Huguenot churches in London and more than 20 outside London; in 1687 the Threadneedle Street church received permission to build a chapel of ease to accommodate its burgeoning congregation. The Huguenots were generally well-received in England, enjoying royal protection, though occasionally the competition created by the skill and industry of the French craftsmen, and their reluctance to conform to the rules of the livery companies, led to difficulties. Integration gradually led to the closing of French churches; by 1841 there were only three left in London, two being conformist. It was in 1841 that the Threadneedle Street church, the only remaining non-conformist French church in London, was obliged to give up its building, to allow for rebuilding in Threadneedle Street, and the congregation moved to a site in St Martin’s le Grand, remaining until 1887 when the church was demolished to make way for an extension to the headquarters of the General Post Office.  Temporary quarters were found, first at the Athenaeum Hall in Tottenham Court Road, and then at a chapel behind 7 Soho Square, whilst the construction of the new church building was underway.  A freehold site for the new church, then occupied by two houses, 8 and 9 Soho Square, was found, at a cost of £10,500. In March 1889 the consistory petitioned the Attorney General for permission to purchase the site and erect a new church accommodating a congregation of 400; permission was given in October 1890, the foundation stone was laid on 28 October 1891 and the building was dedicated on 25 March 1893. The architect chosen for the work was Aston (later Sir Aston) Webb (1849-1930), who in 1886 had redesigned the Victoria Law Courts, Birmingham, and in 1891 won the competition to complete the Victoria and Albert Museum; Webb’s designs for public buildings would include the Admiralty Arch (designed 1905-1907; built 1908-1911) and the re-fronting of Buckingham Palace (1913). Webb built few new churches, though he undertook a number of restoration projects. The French Protestant School in Great Marlborough Street (built in 1897-1898, now demolished) would also be designed by Webb. The builders of the church were Messrs Higgs and Hill, whose tender was for £10,194. A notice in The Builder (27 June 1891) notes an unusual feature of the design: ‘Owing to the nature of the site, hemmed in by houses, the church is nowhere displayed externally’. It has been suggested that discretion was a requirement of the design, but the principal reason for this is likely to have been practical: by being placed to the rear, the church is able to obtain light on three sides, whilst the presbytery and library are lit from the front. Certainly the design gives little outward indication of the function of the building, which looks more like an office building than a church. The existence of the French Protestant Church’s library is first mentioned in 1613-1615, when the church council minutes record the decision to collect subscriptions for ‘the establishment and erection of the library’. The material, housed in a dedicated library designed by Webb, now contains some 1400 early printed volumes; besides church records and manuscripts, are many books representing legacies, gifts, and acquisitions, reflecting the history and interests of the Huguenot congregation. In 1950 a carved panel by J Prangnelli was inserted into the tympanum above the main entrance, commemorating the 400th anniversary of the church’s foundation. The building has otherwise seen little significant alteration.Today, the French Protestant Church in Soho Square, together with the Dutch Church in Austin Friars - rebuilt in 1950-1954 – survive as the direct descendants of the Strangers’ Church founded in 1550. The church in Soho Square is the only remaining French Protestant church in use in Britain, though regular services are held for French Protestants in the crypt of Canterbury Cathedral.\n        \n        \n            Details\n        \n        \n            Church, 1891-1893, by Aston (later Sir Aston) Webb, for the consistory of the French Protestant Church. In Free Franco-Flemish Gothic, with late Romanesque elements. The builders were Messrs Higgs and Hill. The modelling for the Doulton terracotta was done by William Aumonier.MATERIALS: the exterior of the building is of blue Luton brick with red Doulton terracotta dressings and lavish enrichments. The steeply-pitched roofs are slated; the stepped gable ends are marked by terracotta scrolling, above which rise tall brick stacks with terracotta capping. The church interior is mainly faced in buff terracotta, with some slightly darker brickwork. The windows of the south frontage hold horned timber sashes; though the 1970 List entry notes small-pane iron casements, the illustration in The Builder (27 June 1891) appears to show sash frames, as do early photographs. The church windows are leaded, in geometric patterns.PLAN: the building occupies a rectangular plot stretching back from the south-facing street frontage. The church itself, accessed directly from a central passage, occupies the rear part of the building, being set on a north/south axis. The nave rises through two stages, flanked by side aisles, with a semicircular apse to the north. The front range of the building is taken up by the library and the presbytery: the library is to the west of the entrance, and the presbytery, accessed by a staircase to the east of the entrance, is arranged one room deep over the three upper storeys. EXTERIOR: built over four storeys with basement, the principal frontage is five main bays wide, subdivided into nine window bays on the upper floors. The ground floor, which is faced in terracotta with brick bands to the jambs of the openings, contains five round-headed arches; the largest, to the central entrance, is enriched with shafts, and with cusping to the outer arch. The tympanum contains J Prangnelli’s 1950 commemorative carving; this depicts the arrival of the first Huguenots by sea, and the signing of the 1550 charter, with a Huguenot cross above. The basket-arched double doors are of timber, carved with linenfold panels. A secondary entrance to the east is framed by a single order, the doorway enriched by acanthus moulding; there are double doors with glazed panels. The linked openings to either side of the main entrance are framed by arches with flower mouldings resting on pilasters; the windows are divided into two arched lights by a central mullion. Within a frieze at first-floor level is gilded lettering reading ‘EGLISE PROTESTANTE FRANCAISE DE LONDRES’. Above, a central canted bay rises through three storeys to the gable, which is faced with buff terracotta with brick banding; a stepped arcade of niches surrounds the canted attic window, with a cross final to the apex. To either side rise shallow tower-like projections with pyramidal roofs. The windows in the upper storeys have terracotta frames with engaged shafts and decorative mouldings; those to the first floor are segmental-arched and those to the second floor are flat-arched. Small paired square-headed windows to the outer bays have leaded lights. The upper windows to the towers have aprons decorated with classical French swag and drop motifs. The centre of the roof is crowned by a cupola with a leaded lantern.The north of the building is not intended for public viewing, and is very much plainer. The rear of the presbytery is of stock brick, with tall stock brick stacks. Further north, the upper part of the nave of the church rises above the flat roofs of the side aisles. The walls are of stock brick, with buff terracotta frames to the graduated tripartite clerestory windows, which have round-headed arches. Set in the tops of the side aisles are the glass oculi which light the aisles, with modern covers. INTERIOR: within the front doors are glazed inner doors set in a terracotta archway. Beyond is the narrow barrel-vaulted ENTRANCE HALL leading to the church: this serves as an introduction to the church interior, being faced with buff terracotta; to either side are niches in the form of fireplaces, with moulded basket-arched openings, containing original radiators. There is a terrazza floor. An iron lantern is thought to be original. Round-headed archways give access to the library to the west, and a waiting room to the east. At the north end, another round-headed archway, with glazed double doors, leads into the church.Entering the CHURCH, the impression the interior gives of spaciousness filled with light includes an element of a surprise, given its situation at the rear of this enclosed site. The effect is created by the tall clerestory windows, the apse pierced by five lights, top-lights to the vaults of the aisles, and above all to the use of pale buff terracotta for the internal facing. The four-bay nave is separated from the aisles by an arcade of Romanesque arches, the compound piers having shafts defined by moulded bases and capitals, the shafts themselves dying into the piers. Above, a narrow passage runs around the clerestory, its balustrade swelling into small corbelled balconies between the arches. Each trio of clerestory windows is set within a round-headed arch with angled reveals; the windows heads have complex mouldings of scrolls and small bosses.  Around the entrance to the church are graduated panels with cinquefoil heads, beneath a shallow arch. Above the balcony, a high oriel window with leaded ogee lights allows the interior of the church to be viewed from the presbytery, and a doorway from the balcony gives access. Moulded letters beneath the window read: ‘LE TEMPLE DU SEIGNEUR JESUS’. The nave has an austere wagon roof of sequoia wood, with a band of undulating terracotta moulding running beneath it. A high arch with moulded imposts frames the apse, which is in three stages, the windows being in the upper stage. The apse is fitted with semi-circular choir stalls with panelled fronts, the pastor’s seat being at the centre; two additional reading desks in the same manner are located elsewhere. Above are two round-headed arched openings above, one blind, the other containing the 1893 organ by William Hill. The organ pipes are set in timber cases between the arches and the windows above. Between the pipes is a panel with a plain timber cross, placed in 1964 to cover the original cross in moulded terracotta, which is understood to be surrounded by angels and with the Ten Commandments and the Lord’s Prayer in French; this remains in situ, though hidden.  Shafts framing the windows rise to the radiating ribs of the semi-domed roof, terminating in six timber crown finials, said to be a reminder of Edward VI’s role in the foundation of the church.  To the front of the apse is the integrated pulpit in buff and black terracotta, wide and low with a bowed front, with steps to either side; moulded letters along the front read: ‘IN CHRISTO VITA ET LIBERTAS’. The vaulted aisles have ribbed saucer domes with gadrooned bosses, and central leaded lights set above octagonal frames. The aisle walls are banded with brick, and have arched radiator niches. The floor is of timber parquet, with boards in the seating area. The church retains its original sequoia pews, with moulded ends. The communion table is C19, with Tudor Gothic detailing, and is thought to be part of the early furnishings of the building, though not designed for it. The slender terracotta font with scrolled feet and a shallow basin was installed in 1950 on the 400th anniversary of the church’s foundation, and has a dedication to John à Lasco. Near the entrance is a First World War memorial timber tablet in the form of an aedicule, designed by Adrien Montagu in 1920, brought from the demolished French Protestant School, commemorating four students. Beside it is the school’s bell. A handwritten memorial in a glass-fronted case commemorates members of the congregation lost during both the First and Second World Wars. To either side of the apse are small vestries, accessed by heavy planked doors with moulded fillets. A winding stair from the eastern vestry leads to the aisle roof, and the rear access to the presbytery.  The LIBRARY to the south-west is lined on three sides with fitted bookcases and cupboards, original to the building and designed by Aston Webb. The restrained Gothic detailing is more English in character than decoration elsewhere in the church building. There is a central tier of glazed bookcases, with cupboards above and below, those above having trefoil-headed panels and those below having plain panels. The arched doorway has leaf carving to the spandrels, with trefoil panelling above. The wall containing the windows does not have bookcases, but between the windows is a safe in a timber case made to match with trefoil panelling. The fireplace has tiles surrounding a cast-iron grate with a floral panel, set within a bolection-moulded fire-surround; above is a moulded frame within which is set a royal coat of arms in carved and painted timber, though to belong to the late Stuart period; the 1970 List entry notes that at that time there were two coats of arms in the building, but the location of the other is not now known. The waiting room, set between the main entrance hall and the presbytery, has a timber floor and a small cast-iron chimneypiece with an eared panel beneath the shelf. To the east is the entrance hall of the PRESBYTERY, which has a terrazzo floor. The stair leading to the living accommodation has turned balusters and a moulded handrail, both elements becoming plainer between the second and third floors. There is a modern door at the entrance to the living accommodation. The style of the presbytery interior shows the influence of the Queen Anne Revival, in its restrained joinery and features, the majority of which survive, including chimneypieces, panelled doors and fitted cupboards. On the first floor is a double sitting room, divided by multi-panelled double doors set within a panelled opening framed by pilasters; the ceilings have moulded cornices. Both rooms have substantial chimneypieces of Georgian inspiration with Aesthetic Movement tiled cheeks, the example to the W having an integral overmantel glass within a Classical surround. Access to the balcony of the church is gained from a passage running behind these rooms. To the east is a small kitchen with modern fittings. One second-floor bedroom has a chimneypiece with a moulded frieze of interlocking curves. The bedrooms on the third floor have plainer doors with unmoulded panels, and small cast-iron chimneypieces similar to that in the waiting room. The BASEMENT probably originated as the cellars of the C18 houses formerly standing on the site, but these have been greatly adapted for the use of the church building. The southern part of the basement has been converted to a church hall, being a single open space with a parquet floor. The basement contains a boiler room, and modern kitchen and toilet facilities.SUBSIDIARY FEATUREAlong the front of the basement area runs a low wall of banded brick and terracotta. The piers have pedimented caps, with domes topping the gate piers. Between the piers are semi-circular openings containing wrought-iron railings. The gates are thought not to be original.\n\n        \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n    \n        Legacy\n    \n    \n        The contents of this record have been generated from a legacy data system.\n    \n    \n        \n            Legacy System number:\n            \n                427241\n            \n        \n        \n            Legacy System:\n            \n                LBS\n            \n        \n    \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n                    Sources\n                \n                \n                    Books and journalsJaulmes, Y (author), The French Protestant Church of London and the Huguenots, (1993)Pevsner, N, Bradley, S, The Buildings of England: London 6 Westminster, (2003), 394WebsitesOxford Dictionary of National Biography entry for John (Jean) à Lasco, accessed 27 February 2017 from http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/16081'Soho Square Area: Portland Estate, Nos. 8 and 9 Soho Square, The French Protestant Church', in Survey of London: Volumes 33 and 34, St Anne Soho, ed.

    "wikipedia_text": "The French Protestant Church of London (Église protestante française de Londres) is a Reformed/Presbyterian church that has catered to the French-speaking community of London since 1550. It is the last remaining Huguenot church of London. Its current temple in Soho Square is a Grade II* listed building designed by Aston Webb and erected in 1891–93.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Church was founded by a Royal Charter of King Edward VI on 24 July 1550.\nAt the request of the Huguenots of London, in 1560 John Calvin sent a trusted emissary from Geneva, pastor Nicolas des Gallars, to help provide the young congregation its Reformed theology and Presbyterian organisation.\nIn 1700, at the height of the French refugee population following the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, 23 Huguenot places of worship existed in London. The Church's temple is the only one that is active today: the French Protestant Church in Brighton (opened in 1887) closed in 2008.\n\n\n== Organisation ==\nThe Church is a registered charity under English law. A related charity, The French Huguenot Church of London Charitable Trust, provides funds for the Church and other charitable objects.\nStéphane Desmarais has been the pastor of the Church since 1 September 2013. He is the 72nd French-speaking pastor of the Church since 1550, and the 70th pastor appointed to this office since Nicolas des Gallars in 1560.\nThe governing body of the Church is the Consistory. Its members are co-opted and tacitly approved by the congregation. The pastor is a member of the Consistory ex officio.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nYves Jaulmes, The French Protestant Church of London and the Huguenots: from the Church's foundation to the present day, published by the French Protestant Church of London, 1993, p. 59 ISBN 0952120607.\nManifesto, (or Declaration of Principles), of the French Protestant Church of London, Founded by Charter of Edward VI. 24th July, A.D. 1550.

    "wikipedia_text": "13 Soho Square is a Grade II* listed building in Soho Square, London. It was built between 1768 and 1769, with earlier woodwork around 1677. The building was home to a number of notable residents, including the merchant and Whig politician Sir Isaac Rebow, the Jacobite George Mackenzie, 3rd Earl of Cromartie, and the physician George Leman Tuthill. In the 1970s and 80s 13 Soho Square was the home of Richard Williams Animation, where a number of award-winning films were made, including the short film A Christmas Carol, which won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short in 1972.\n\n\n== History ==\n13 Soho Square was built between 1768 and 1769, with earlier woodwork around 1677. It is a three-storey building, stucco faced, with a slate roof and a mansard attic.\nThe merchant and Whig politician Sir Isaac Rebow lived at No 13 Soho Square from 1696 until at least 1703. Other notable inhabitants include the Jacobite George Mackenzie, 3rd Earl of Cromartie who lived there from 1716 to 1760. Mackenzie joined the Jacobite rising of 1745 and was taken prisoner in Sutherland after the Battle of Littleferry. The physician George Leman Tuthill gave public lectures at 13 Soho Square from 1811 to 1821.\nThe building was the home of Richard Williams Animation during the 1970s and 1980s, where a number of award-winning films were made, including the Academy Award-winning short film A Christmas Carol, which won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short in 1972. In 1973 Williams closed down the studio and brought Hollywood animation veterans Art Babbitt, Grim Natwick and Ken Harris to train a new generation of young animators at 13 Soho Square.\n13 Soho Square was listed Grade II* in 1978. Surviving period features worthy of note include a stone staircase in the interior dating to 1768–69 with a wrought iron balustrade.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of London\n\n\n== References =="

In next bay a late C18 bombe-shaped altar table metal gilt painted and very fine mahogany and gilt gradine and reredos with fixed tabernacle with inlaid door, late C18 and said to be from another London Catholic chapel of the date. Also carved painted statue of the Virgin above under reused late C19 bed tester. Next bay has carved wooden confessional box as above, fixed pulpit square on plan, of carved variegated marbles in neo-Renaissance style, attached to wall neo-Renaissance carved mahogany backboard and tester, probably a gift of 1901 (inscription). Next bay has a fixed marble altar c1900 with wooden statue of St John Bosco, by Delapre, maker.\nOn the south side from the first bay of the narthex a three storey statuary marble altar to the Virgin, elaborate reredos with Corinthian order supporting an elaborate pedimented and scrolled attic and marble statue of the Virgin of Lourdes, possibly a gift of 1892. Next bay has a fixed alabaster altar in High Victorian Gothic style with polychromatic frontal of stylises leaves, spars etc. Tripartite panel painting above fixed afgainst wall forming shallow reredos below fixed picture, Christ with Martha and Mary. All contained under Ionic columns supporting segmental pediment of late C18 date, the reredos of the altar of the 1793 church. Next bay, fixed marble altar and reredos with columns supporting segmental pediment with fixed painting of St Joseph and the Christ Child and inscription to dedication of reredos of 1892. Next bay has fixed wooden altar with attached thin marble panel within elaborate gilt frame and central flaming Sacred Heart against sunburst, late C18 from the gallery of the previous church. A reredos of plinth supporting semi-detached pairs of lotus columns supporting triangular pediment, all late C18. Fixed painted wood statue of Christ by Mayer and Co. of Munich, c1860. On the south side also is a domed side chapel, square on plan, with no access available. This is dedicated to the Lady of Sorrows and is said to contain a Pieta by Theodore Phyffers, Sculptor, c1860.\nThe Sanctuary arch is expressed through two storeys with enriched compound Corinthian pilasters. Initial half-bay and apsed plan lit from pair of windows north and south but no lighting at east end. Stencilled lettered quotations in frieze of entablature and either side of fixed marble panel of St Patrick in attic storey. Gilt and green stencilled decoration to coffer ceiling. Fixed marble communion rails neo-Renaissance in style, with pair of gilt metal gates. At Sanctuary level the floor is laid in marble of Byzantine inspiration. There is a detached working altar made from the mensa of the original high altar, which survives as a dwarf wall in the original position with a half reredos. Above the altar C18 hanging picture of Crucifixion after Van Dyck. Marble lining on south and round apse c1930? Two doorcases of similar date incorporating the harp of Ireland to standard C18 classical design. In north bay a polished wood classical probably C18 organ case within its own niche. A single bank of fixed choir benches on south.\nHISTORY: Existing building replaces a late C18 building adapted for Catholic worship and used since 1802 and retains late C18 Roman Catholic church monuments and altars of great rarity. The church has a strong claim to be the first Roman Catholic Church in England dedicated to St Patrick as required by a large late C18 and C19 Irish population in this part of London. The architects were one of the unsuccessful competitors for the Brompton Oratory and the Italian Renaissance style is comparatively rare for church architecture in the last decade of the C19.[\"Survey of London.

    "wikipedia_text": "St Patrick's Church is a large Roman Catholic parish church in Soho Square, London. St Pat's (as it is informally known) was consecrated as a chapel in a building behind Carlisle House on 29 September 1792, one of the first Catholic buildings allowed in Great Britain after the Reformation.\nThe present church building was built between 1891 and 1893, to designs by John Kelly of Leeds, and replaced the earlier and smaller chapel built by Father Arthur O'Leary in the 1790s. The church has an unusual longish shape due to plot constrictions given at that time. The building is constructed out of bricks with a bell-tower. It is Grade II* listed. The main entrance has a Roman-style porch with Corinthian columns. Above the entrance is an inscription: VT CHRISTIANI ITA ET ROMANI SITIS (\"Ut christiani ita et romani sitis\", i.e. “Be ye Christians as those of the Roman Church”). It is a quotation taken from the writings of St. Patrick.\nThe building was closed for renovation and refurbishment between 28 February 2010 and 31 May 2011. During the renovations, services were held in the nearby Chapel of St Barnabas, at The House of St Barnabas.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further  reading ==\nMarcantonio, Alfredo.

Completed 1814; erected 1816.  The sculptor was Richard Westmacott the younger.  A bronze figure on a granite pedestal.  Fox is seated (the reason for this is thought to be that he was too portly to appear dignified standing) dressed in consular robes and sandals.  With his right hand he holds the Magna Carta; the seal of the scroll closely imitates the original in the British Museum.  On each face of the pedestal, a recessed panel.  On the north face, in Roman letters made of brass (two of which are slightly damaged): 'CHARLES JAMES FOX / ERECTED / MDCCCXVI'.  Three steps and plinth of Portland stone. HISTORY: Charles James Fox (1749-1806), politician, was born into an influential political family, the son of Henry Fox, 1st Baron Holland, and Lady Caroline Lennox.  Fox was given unusual freedom from an early age; he decided to enroll at Eton, where he excelled as a classical scholar.  He then went to Oxford, but left without a degree, embarking instead on a grand tour which lasted from 1766 to 1768, during which he formed connections with European leaders in fashion, politics and letters.  On his return, at the age of nineteen, he became MP for Midhurst; in 1780 he was elected MP for Westminster, retaining the seat, with brief interruption, until his death.Throughout his career, Fox was to champion causes associated with liberty - he was in favour of American independence and the French Revolution, and supported the abolition of the slave trade and Catholic emancipation - but his taste for gambling, drinking, and romantic intrigue earned him a reputation for excessive freedom, resulting in personal immorality and political recklessness.  Nevertheless, his professional rise was swift, initially in Lord North's government.  Influenced by Edmund Burke, Fox was increasingly convinced that George III wished to undermine parliamentary government, and he became a leading figure in the whig party.  His support for America in its War of Independence made him many enemies, notably the king and Lord North.  Nevertheless, in 1783 Fox joined with North in a short-lived coalition.  Thereafter, Fox led the opposition to the new prime minister, William Pitt the younger.  Fox was eloquent in his support for the French Revolution, and his criticism of Britain's war with France, though he was shocked by the eventual violence of the Revolution.  On Pitt's death in February 1806, Lord Grenville formed a 'ministry of all the talents', in which Fox was foreign minister.  His brief tenure was clouded by failed negotiations for peace with Napoleon, towards whom he had once been sympathetic.  Fox died in September 1806.  Fox had been a consistent opponent of the slave trade, 'a practice so enormous, so savage, and so repugnant to all laws human and divine', that he said he 'should prefer the abolition of it to any political good that can be gained or even wished, for the Party or the country'.  One of his last political acts was to move a resolution for the general abolition of the slave trade, asserting on 10 June 1806 that, 'this House, conceiving the African slave trade to be contrary to the principles of justice, humanity, and sound policy, will, with all practicable expedition, proceed to take effectual measures for abolishing the said trade'.  The House of Commons voted overwhelmingly in favour of the resolution, and the Lords assented on 25 June.  For his political supporters, the abolition of the slave trade came to be emblematic of the liberty so dear to Fox.  Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford, built a temple of liberty at Woburn Abbey dedicated to Fox; the first pediment proposed for the unfinished temple after Russell's death in 1802 showed a slave being crowned with the cap of liberty.  Fox's memorial in Westminster Abbey, erected in 1822, shows the politician on his deathbed, supported by Liberty, to whom he appeals on behalf of the slave kneeling at his feet.  The committee appointed to arrange Fox's memorial raised £12,450 (his friends having already paid for his funeral in Westminster Abbey, cleared his debts, and given his wife a pension); it was decided that besides the marble monument in Westminster Abbey, a bronze statue should be erected.  Richard Westmacott the younger was sculptor of both.  The statue was completed in April 1814, and a number of possible sites were considered.  Bloomsbury Square, suggested by the 6th Duke of Bedford, was chosen as being in an area associated with the whigs; Fox sits looking down Bloomsbury Place towards the statue of his friend the 5th Duke of Bedford, also by Westmacott.  The statue was unveiled on 19 June 1816.  A bronzed plaster cast was placed in the entrance hall of Holland House, the Fox family's London house.  The statue was restored in 2006 to mark the bicentenary of Fox's death.SOURCES:\nNB Penny, 'The Whig Cult of Fox in Early Nineteenth-Century Sculpture', Past and Present, no. 70 (Feb 1976), 94-105\nDictionary of National Biography\nM Dresser, 'Set in Stone?

    "wikipedia_text": "The statue of Charles James Fox stands at the north end of Bloomsbury Square in the London borough of Camden. Erected in 1816, the sculptor was Richard Westmacott. It commemorates the Whig politician who died in 1806. Fox is shown in the garb of a Roman senator.  The statue is a Grade II* listed structure.\n\n\n== History ==\nCharles James Fox (24 January 1749 – 13 September 1806), enjoyed a political career of nearly forty years. Rarely holding office, he championed a range of liberal causes, including American independence, the French Revolution, Catholic Emancipation and the abolition of slavery. Personally dissolute, with weaknesses for women, gambling and alcohol, he died, heavily in debt, at the age of 57. His career has been described as of \"almost unrelieved failure\" but his generosity of mind, his famed charm and his \"genius for friendship\" left his many friends and admirers desolate at his death. As well as paying for his funeral, clearing his debts, and funding a pension for his widow, they raised the considerable sum of £12,450 for a memorial. The sum was sufficient to allow for two, a statue in Westminster Abbey, and that located in Bloomsbury Square. The site was given by John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford, son of Fox's great friend, the 5th Duke. The sculptor was Richard Westmacott and the statue was completed in 1814 and raised in 1816.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe statue is of bronze and shows Fox in the robes of a Roman senator. He is seated, reputedly as his friends considered that a realistic portrayal of a standing Fox would have appeared undignified, due to his corpulence. Fox holds a copy of Magna Carta, symbolising his commitment to liberty. The statue stands on a granite plinth which is carved with Fox's full name and the date of the statue's erection. The plinth itself is raised on a four-staged pedestal base. The statue is 2.74 metres (9.0 ft) high and the plinth it stands on is 2.43 metres (8.0 ft).\nThe statue was designated a Grade II listed structure in 1951. It was promoted to a Grade II* listing on 23 August 2008, UNESCO's International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition, though the statue does not explicitly reference Fox's championing of the abolitionist cause. \n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nBlackwood, John (1989).

    "wikipedia_text": "St George the Martyr Holborn is an Anglican  church located at the south end of Queen Square, Holborn, in the London Borough of Camden. It is dedicated to  Saint George, and was originally so-called to distinguish it from the later nearby church of St. George's Bloomsbury, with which it shared a burial ground (now St George's Gardens). While the historical name remains its formal designation, it is today known simply as St George's Holborn.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe church was built in 1703–06 by Arthur Tooley, as a chapel of ease to St Andrew, Holborn. Tooley was paid £3,500 to build the chapel and two houses by a group of fifteen trustees including Sir Streynsham Master. It was later bought by the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches  and became a parish church in 1723, receiving the dedication to St George, in honour of Streynsham Master's governorship of Fort St George in India.\nThe antiquary William Stukeley was the rector from 1747 to his death there in 1765.\nThe church was remodelled in the early nineteenth century by J.B. Papworth, who added a bell-tower and two frontages to what had previously been a plain brick building, and once again in 1867–69 by S. S.Teulon, who almost entirely changed the exterior, removed the galleries and added the present columns and roof.\nAfter the death of Joseph Stalin the Rev. Stanley Evans, M.A. gave a memorial service in his honour on March 13, 1953.\nIt was at this church that Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath married on Bloomsday in 1956.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nThe church was designated a Grade II* listed building on 24 October 1951.\n\n\n=== Organ ===\nThe organ has been listed as a historic instrument by the British Institute of Organ Studies. The first organ was erected in 1773; it has been rebuilt over the years.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHTB network\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSt George's Holborn homepage\nDiocese of London"

    "wikipedia_text": "The Kimpton Fitzroy London is a historic five-star hotel, located on Russell Square, Bloomsbury, in the London Borough of Camden. From its opening in 1900 until 2018, it was known as the Hotel Russell.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Hotel Russell was built in 1898 by the architect Charles Fitzroy Doll and opened in 1900. It is distinctively clad in decorative thé-au-lait (\"tea with milk\") terracotta and was based on the Château de Madrid near the Bois de Boulogne in Paris.\nIts restaurant, which was originally named after the architect but is now called Neptune, is said to be almost identical to the RMS Titanic's dining room, which he designed. Also in the hotel is \"Lucky George\", a bronze dragon on the second floor stairs. An identical copy was on the Titanic.\nKnown for its palatial design, the hotel's fixtures and fittings included an ornate Pyrenean marble staircase and an interior sunken garden. Each room was fitted with an en-suite bathroom, a great innovation at the time. A sister hotel by the same architect, the Imperial Hotel, was also built on Russell Square, but it was demolished in the late 1960s.\nThe life-size statues of four Queens - Elizabeth I, Mary II, Anne and Victoria - above the main entrance were the work of the sculptor Henry Charles Fehr. The façade, by Doll, incorporates the coats of arms of the world's nations (as they were in 1898) in the spandrels of the first floor.\nThe hotel was one of the few that were not taken over by the War Office during the Second World War. It survived the war largely intact, but the magnificent dome that stood on the roof was badly damaged in an air raid of 1941 and not replaced.\nCampaign for Better Transport, then known as 'Transport 2000' was launched on 6 February 1973 with a press conference at the Hotel Russell, London.\nThe Russell Group of universities is named after Hotel Russell, where the first informal meetings took place.\nOn 16 April 2018, the hotel reopened as The Principal London after an extensive renovation by the Principal Hotel Company. In July 2018, the Principal Hotel Company sold 12 hotels in its portfolio (including The Principal London) to Covivio Hotels, which then licensed their management to InterContinental Hotels Group. The hotel was renamed the Kimpton Fitzroy London on 24 October 2018.\nThe interior features contemporary design by lead designer Tara Bernerd & Partners. The bedrooms are decorated with a design by British textile artist Kit Miles.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe Hotel Russell is mentioned in Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Cats during the song \"The Journey to the Heaviside Layer\".\nThe Hotel Russell is used as a location in the 1981 miniseries Kessler.\nThe Kimpton Fitzroy London appeared on Top Chef: World All-Stars as the accommodation of the season's contestants.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nHotels in London\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website"

In situ reinforced concrete and precast mullions with a cladding of prefabricated bronze-anodised aluminium panels and window sections.  In plan the building makes a strong barrier to the traffic of Bedford Way while extending the concept of flexible teaching space already explored at the University of East Anglia, Norwich.  Six storeys above ground, with three basement storeys, in 1999 numbered 1-9.  Flat, paved roof.  Long spinal range, with wing to rear, and footings for a second incorporated in 1990-3 library extension.  Large basement includes lecture theatre, the Logan Hall, under forecourt facing Lasdun's extension to the School of Oriental and African Studies opposite; conference facilities, students' union and service entrance. Split-level entrance hall gives on to library, drama studio and bookshop, with flexible teaching areas above, mainly facing street, and tutorial rooms, mainly facing courtyard and in wing.  The elevational treatment is in Lasdun's mature language of strata and towers, a grid of aluminium panels and glazing set over concrete plinth on western elevation, with massively over-scaled concrete staircase towers.  On the eastern elevation to Bedford Way, the entrance floors are set back behind exposed frame, and has cut-back corners which demonstrate the smooth, sharp concrete particularly forcefully.  The quality of finishes is exceptional, and the contrasting texture of materials unique in Lasdun's surviving work.  The single spur that was built is highly sculptural, with a striking silhouette of angular concrete escape stairs rising above the floor levels and curtain walling.  A similar system of anodised aluminium and glass was adopted by Lasdun for his extension, but with more pronounced glazing bars, and with three pyramidal roof lights that are the clearest indication of the new work.  Entrance doors in anodised aluminium surrounds.  New entrance on Bedford Way, reached up steps, installed by Lasdun in 1993. INTERIORS.  The interiors are simple, but the quality of concrete finishes is exemplary throughout.  The upper teaching spaces were designed to be flexible, and continue to be altered regularly - a tribute to the success of the original concept.  The areas of special interest are the lift lobbies, where Lasdun's finishes can be seen at their best, and the entrance hall and principal stair to the lecture theatre.  This staircase, in a deep well in which are set giant columns, is a version in smooth concrete with brick treds of his earlier ceremonial stair at the Royal College of Physicians in Regent's Park (LB Camden, grade I), with concrete walls and balustrade.  The entrance hall, with pavioured floors, is on two main levels, corresponding to the different level of Bedford Way and the square behind.  Separate stairs lead to bookshop on lower level. While the University of London was discouraged from further expansion in the post-war years it was appreciated that certain departments such as Education, Law and the School of Oriental and African Studies required enlarged facilities.  Lasdun was commissioned by the University of London in 1960 to develop the concept of a spinal range along Bedford Way and to its north which had been published by Sir Leslie Martin and Trevor Dannatt the year before.  His task was to integrate the new buildings within an existing urban fabric, whose pattern of Georgian squares was belatedly being appreciated.  Lasdun's scheme preserved more terraces than had the earlier proposals, and created a new square between his two buildings, much of it formed over the basement lecture theatre.  For him, the relationship between the spine building and the SOAS pavilion is paramount.The building was formally opened by the Queen in 1977.  `Lasdun's architecture carries absolute conviction', Architectural Review, March 1980, p.148.  Although a building constructed to a grid, it is Lasdun's interest in planes and interpenetrating masses and belief in pure form and modelling.  His synthesis of the modern movement of the 1930s, inspired by working with Wells Coates and Berthold Lubetkin, and his unique understanding of the formalism of the later generation of the New Brutalists makes him a comparable figure with Louis Kahn and is demonstrated particularly well here.  This building forms a contrasting mass to the square pavilion of Lasdun's extension to the School of Oriental and African Studies, with which it forms an exceptionally strong group.Architects' Journal, 5 March 1959, p.336\nArchitects' Journal, 14 June 1967, p.1384\nBuilding Design, 15 October 1976\nArchitects' Journal, 12 December 1990, p.11\nArchitectural Review, March 1980, pp.145-54\nBridget Cherry and Nikolaus Pevsner, The Buildings of England, London North, London, Penguin Books, 1998, pp.279-80\n\n        \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n    \n        Legacy\n    \n    \n        The contents of this record have been generated from a legacy data system.\n    \n    \n        \n            Legacy System number:\n            \n                486897\n            \n        \n        \n            Legacy System:\n            \n                LBS\n            \n        \n    \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n                    Sources\n                \n                \n                    Books and journals'Architects Journal' in 5 March, (1959), 336'Architects Journal' in 14 June, (1967), 1384'Architects Journal' in 12 December, (1990), 11'Building Design' in 15 October, (1976)\n                \n\n\n\n                    \n                        \n\n\n    \n        Legal\n    \n\n\n    \n        This building is listed under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as amended for its special architectural or historic interest.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n\n            \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n            \n                Map\n            \n            \n                This map is for quick reference purposes only and may not be to scale.

Converted and refurbished 2001 by Denton Corker Marshall with interior design by Philippe Starck.    \n\n                    \n\n\n    \n        Reasons for Designation\n    \n    \n        The Sanderson Hotel, built as Sanderson House in 1957-60 by Reginald Uren of Slater, Moberly and Uren, is listed at Grade II* for the following principal reasons:\n* Architectural interest: an outstanding work by an important mid-C20 architect, applying the International Modernist idiom to a large-scale commercial building with exceptional rigour and finesse;\n* Artistic interest: one of the best British applications of the US concept of the 'art building', with artworks by Jupp Dernback-Mayen and John Piper skilfully incorporated into the overall architectural programme;\n* Historic interest: built as the headquarters Arthur Sanderson and Sons, one of the UK's leading firms of decorative designers and manufacturers during the mid-C20.\n\n    \n\n                    \n\n\n        \n            History\n        \n        \n            The firm of Sanderson was established in 1860 by Arthur Sanderson, an importer of luxury European wallpapers. It transferred its operations from Islington to Marylebone in 1865, and by 1869 was commissioning its own designs in addition to its imported wares. In the course of the C20, Sandersons established itself as one of London's most fashionable suppliers of wallpapers, textiles and paints. New showrooms and offices, designed by Sir Albert Richardson, were built in Wells Street in the early 1930s, but by the mid-50s the company - granted a Royal Warrant in 1951 after its papers had been used to decorate the Royal Festival Hall - was ready to build on a larger scale. The architects Slater, Moberly and Uren, who had lately completed the flagship John Lewis store on Oxford Street, were commissioned to design a new headquarters and showroom building to replace Sandersons' original premises in Berners Street. The design was influenced by US corporate architecture such as the Seagram and Lever buildings in New York, while the close collaboration between principal architect Reginald Uren, landscape architect Phillip Hicks, interior designer Beverley Pick and artists John Piper and Jupp Dernbach-Mayern places it in the Bauhaus-inspired tradition of the 'art building'. Work commenced in 1957 and was completed in time for the company's centenary in 1960. Sandersons finally vacated the site in 1992, and in 2001 the building was converted into a hotel by architects Denton Corker Marshall and interior designer Philippe Starck.Reginald Uren (1906-88) was born in New Zealand, and trained in London under Charles Holden. He made his name in 1933 by winning the competition for the new Hornsey Town Hall with a pioneering Dudok-inspired Modernist design; in 1936 he joined the partnership of Slater and Moberly, surveyors to the Berners estate, whose previous commissions included the Bourne and Hollingsworth store on Oxford Street (1925-7). The firm's later works include the Peter Jones store on Sloane Square (1936-9, with William Crabtree and CH Reilly) and the abovementioned John Lewis building on Oxford Street (1939-55).\n\n        \n        \n            Details\n        \n        \n            MATERIALS: in-situ concrete frame, with columns placed on a 27ft grid. Curtain-walled exterior with hollow aluminium mullions carrying the services. Solid areas (to ends of main block and to rear) faced in brick, Portland stone and glazed faience.PLAN: the building comprises three main wings set around a central courtyard. The wings are only 45ft deep to allow for maximum daylight penetration to the showrooms. The front (east) range to Berners Street is of seven storeys, with an nine-storey tower block at right-angles to the south and a lower five-storey wing parallel to this to the north. The west side of the courtyard is enclosed by a three-storey link range overlooking Wells Mews. As originally built, the middle part of the building, including the courtyard, formed part of the vehicle circulation, with the central garden forming an island between 'in' and 'out' routes which led via ramps to the basement car park. To the south was the main retail entrance, with lobby, lifts and stair rising up to the showrooms. The latter, totalling 34,000 sq ft, occupied much of the first, second and third floors and included - in the tower area - a double-height display space surrounded by a gallery. A second entrance to the north gave access to the trade counter, with a separate stair and lifts behind leading directly to the offices and studios on the upper floors.Under the hotel conversion of 2001, the whole of the ground floor was enclosed to form an enlarged lobby, bar and restaurant; vehicle access is now only possible from Wells Mews to the rear. The open-plan first floor was subdivided to form a spa, gym and guest bedrooms, with further bedrooms occupying the whole of the floors above. Features belonging to this phase are too recent to form part of the building's special interest.EXTERIORS: the 230ft front to Berners Street is a continuous sheer slab of curtain walling that 'floats' above the recessed ground floor. A 4ft 6in module determines the proportions. Windows are aluminium-framed sliding sashes, with spandrel panels of opaque fired glass - turquoise on the first floor, grey above. Sharply-profiled aluminium mullions run unbroken from the first to the sixth floor. The seventh floor is set back as a penthouse with a floating cornice above. The entrance is off-centre to the left, on the axis of the tower, and is marked by a deep cantilevered canopy and lettered fascia; the glazing immediately behind is set slightly deeper between the mullions to give further emphasis, especially in oblique views. The ground-floor columns, set 9ft back behind the cantilevered upper storeys, are sheathed in black Kellymount marble; the spaces between are now infilled with frameless glass panels (not of special interest). The service stairwells at either end are faced in Portland stone, with green slate panels marking the exit doors.The tower block and the north wing are treated in a similar fashion to the Berners Street range. In contrast to the crystalline purity of the front elevation, the rear elevation to Wells Mews presents a zigzag building line and an assortment of different shapes and materials, with blue-green faience cladding to the ends of the tower block and the north range, and brown brick used for the lower elements between. In the centre are two large entrances to the car park, and to the left is a delivery bay with a canopied pedestrian entrance alongside.INTERIORS: the entrance lobby was remodelled and much enlarged during the 2001 conversion. Its principal surviving feature is an abstract marble and glass mosaic by Jupp Dernbach-Mayen, which clads the outer wall of the lift enclosure. Affixed to this is a plaque commemorating the laying of the foundation stone by Ivan Sanderson on 1st May 1957. The remaining fittings here belong to the Philippe Starck scheme, and are too recent to form part of the special interest of the building. To the rear of the lobby is the principal stair, a flying structure with open timber treads and a slender balustrade of polished aluminium. Behind is a large (32ft by 21ft) back-lit stained glass mural designed by John Piper - his largest secular work - and executed by Patrick Reyntiens, displaying stylised plant forms against blocks of brilliant colour. The stair rises only as far as the first floor; more modest concrete stairs at the ends of the building give access to the upper levels. The former showrooms, offices and studios here have been thoroughly remodelled to form the hotel's spa, gym and guest rooms, and contain no known features of special interest.At the heart of the building is a courtyard, surrounded by marble-clad columns like those at the front, and now glazed in to form an open-air extension to the hotel's restaurant and bar. The central feature - restored during the 2001 alterations - is an 'architectural garden' designed by Philip Hicks with sculpture by Dernbach-Mayen. The design is of Japanese inspiration, with a raised area containing gravel, moss and boulders surrounded by slate paving, planting and a rectangular fountain pool. To the rear is a mural featuring slabs of polished grey marble shot through with veins of coloured mosaic. To the fore is a marble plinth bearing a bowl-like sculpture in polished black basalt.\n        \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n    \n        Legacy\n    \n    \n        The contents of this record have been generated from a legacy data system.\n    \n    \n        \n            Legacy System number:\n            \n                430062\n            \n        \n        \n            Legacy System:\n            \n                LBS\n            \n        \n    \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n                    Sources\n                \n                \n                    Books and journalsNairn,  I, Modern Buildings in London, (1964), 33-4Pevsner, N, Cherry, B, The Buildings of England: London 3 North West, (1991), 631'The Builder' in , (8 April 1960)'The Builder' in The Builder, (11 November 1960)'Architectural Review' in , (June 1960)'Architect and Building News' in , (4 May 1960)'Architecture d'aujourd'hui' in Nuits glamour et cantine de luxe, (September/October 2000)'Architect's Journal' in , (3 March 1960)'The Builder' in The Builder, (1 August 1958)'Contract Journal' in , (25 February 1960)'Interbuild' in , (March 1960)\n                \n\n\n\n                    \n                        \n\n\n    \n        Legal\n    \n\n\n    \n        This building is listed under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as amended for its special architectural or historic interest.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n\n            \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n            \n                Map\n            \n            \n                This map is for quick reference purposes only and may not be to scale.

    "wikipedia_text": "The Sanderson Hotel is a hotel on Berners Street, London, built in 1958 as the new headquarters and showroom for Arthur Sanderson and Sons, manufacturers of wallpaper, fabrics and paint, for the company's centennial. The building was designed by architect Reginald Uren, of the architectural firm, Slater and Uren. The original design allowed for dynamic room configurations. The building surrounds a courtyard with a Japanese garden designed by Philip Hicks. The Sanderson building was listed Grade II* by English Heritage in 1991. After refurbishment by Philippe Starck and Denton Corker Marshall, it was reopened by Morgans Hotel Group as the Sanderson Hotel on 25 April 2000.\nIn 2019 the hotel was sold to Vivion, a real estate firm backed by the Israeli tycoon Amir Dayan.\nThe hotel occupies the site of 54 Berners Street, known for the Berners Street Hoax of 1810.\n\n\n== Design features ==\nThe building was constructed with a modernist steel and glass frontage that is seen in the opening footage of the Danger Man television series. The courtyard garden, situated on top of an underground car park, fronted the wholesale trade sales area to the right; the retail areas were to the left and centre. The courtyard garden, designed by landscape architect Philip Hicks, was recreated for the hotel and has been included on the English Heritage register of Parks and Gardens of Historic Interest; originally open to the sky, it was glazed over in the hotel conversion.\nThe lobby has both lifts and a grand flying staircase which rises against a large backlit stained glass mural masking the lift shafts; this is the largest secular work by John Piper. The first floor was devoted to wallpaper displays and its lengthy retail counter allowed for conversion to a long bar. The second floor was reserved for fabric displays, while the third floor held management offices and an interior design studio.\nAfter refurbishment as a hotel, each room had a sleigh bed with a reproduction of the 1895 painting The Cloud by  Prince Eugen bolted to the ceiling above, and a pair of penis-shaped dumbbells. The rooms were redesigned in 2014 by Tim Andreas.\nThe hotel's Malaysian-European restaurant Suka was designed by India Mahdavi with furnishings by Tom Dixon.\n\n\n== Popular culture ==\nIn summer 2009, weekly live music sessions in the Sanderson's courtyard called 'Sanderson Predicts' featured new artists, including both Marina & The Diamonds and Little Boots performing before they were big stars.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSanderson Hotel"

Britain in the Thirties; A.D.Profile.Since the early C20, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) has grown into a public service broadcaster of international repute. Aiming to inform, educate and entertain, the BBC plays a prominent role in British life and culture. The BBC was formed on 18 October 1922 as a Company, with the responsibility to provide a public radio broadcast service in Britain. It is the world’s oldest national broadcaster. The BBC’s first broadcast was a news bulletin on 14 November 1922. At first the daily six hours of news and entertainment programmes reached perhaps only tens of thousands of listeners. The Company’s growing national importance was recognised when it became a public corporation by Royal Charter on 1 January 1927. Expansion of the BBC’s transmission station network, continuing increases in airtime and growth in the number of people owning a radio set licence meant that, by 1939, BBC programming was listened to in about 75% of British households. The BBC began broadcasting the world’s first regularly-scheduled high-definition television service on 2 November 1936. By the time of the BBC’s centenary in 2022, its radio, television and online services were being used by on average five million adults every minute of the day and night.Listing NGR: TQ2888481593\n\n        \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n    \n        Legacy\n    \n    \n        The contents of this record have been generated from a legacy data system.\n    \n    \n        \n            Legacy System number:\n            \n                424540\n            \n        \n        \n            Legacy System:\n            \n                LBS\n            \n        \n    \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n                    Sources\n                \n                \n                    Books and journalsHendy, D, The BBC.

    "wikipedia_text": "Broadcasting House is the headquarters of the BBC, in Portland Place and Langham Place, London. The first radio broadcast from the building was made on 15 March 1932, and the building was officially opened two months later, on 15 May. The main building is in Art Deco style, with a facing of Portland stone over a steel frame. It is a Grade II* listed building and includes the BBC Radio Theatre, where music and speech programmes are recorded in front of a studio audience.\nAs part of a major consolidation of the BBC's property portfolio in London, Broadcasting House has been extensively renovated and extended. This involved the demolition of post-war extensions on the eastern side of the building, replaced by a new wing completed in 2005. The wing was named the \"John Peel Wing\" in 2012, after the disc jockey. BBC London, BBC Arabic Television and BBC Persian Television are housed in the new wing, which also contains the reception area for BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 1Xtra (the studios themselves are in the new extension to the main building). Since February 2024 BBC Radio 2 and BBC Radio 6 Music have moved in, opposite the BBC Radio 1 studios on the 8th floor. This was created by converting office space, after the decision to move out of Wogan House was made. \nThe main building was refurbished, and an extension built to the rear. The radio stations BBC Radio 3, BBC Radio 4, BBC Radio 4 Extra and the BBC World Service transferred to refurbished studios within the building. The extension links the old building with the John Peel Wing, and includes a new combined newsroom for BBC News, with studios for the BBC News channel, BBC World News and other news programming. The move of news operations from BBC Television Centre was completed in March 2013.\nThe official name of the building is Broadcasting House but the BBC now also uses the term “new Broadcasting House” (with a lowercase 'n') in its publicity referring to the new extension rather than the whole building, with the original building known as “old Broadcasting House”.\n\n\n== Construction ==\n\nConstruction of Broadcasting House began in 1928, with programmes gradually transferring to the building. On 15 March 1932, the first musical programme was given by the bandleader Henry Hall and the BBC Dance Orchestra. Hall also wrote and performed, with his dance band, Radio Times, the name of the BBC's schedule publication.\nThe first news bulletin was read by Stuart Hibberd on 18 March. The last transmission from Savoy Hill was on 14 May, and Broadcasting House officially opened on 15 May 1932. George Val Myer designed the building in collaboration with the BBC's civil engineer, M. T. Tudsbery. The interiors were the work of Raymond McGrath, an Australian-Irish architect. He directed a team that included Serge Chermayeff and Wells Coates and designed the vaudeville studio, the associated green and dressing rooms, and the dance and chamber music studios in a flowing Art Deco style.\n\nThe building is built in two parts. Dispensing with the oft-found central light-well of contemporary buildings this size, the central core containing the recording studios was a windowless structure built of brick. (Structural brick rather than steel framing was used in order to reduce noise transmission both from without and between studios.) The surrounding outer portion, designed for offices and ancillary spaces, is steel-framed and faced with Portland stone. While the outer portion had plenty of windows, the inner core required special sound-dampened ventilation systems.\nThere were two areas where right of ancient lights would cause height restrictions. While the rights on the southern side ceased to be a problem after the owners of those rights gave concessions, the rights on the eastern side were dealt with by sloping the roof away from the street from the fourth floor up. This not only affected the floor plan of the structure, but meant that the interior recording tower could not be built to the top floor. (Thus, one studio on the top floor was actually outside the central studio core structure.)\nUnderground structures, including a hundred-year-old sewer, also presented problems during construction. The building is above the Bakerloo line of the London Underground: the Victoria line was tunnelled beneath in the 1960s, and presented problems for construction of the Egton Wing (see below). Noise from passing trains is audible within the radio theatre but generally imperceptible in recordings. The ground floor was fitted with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the street, as the BBC believed that to finance such a project (costing £25 million in today's money), they would need to let the ground floor as a retail unit. The rapid expansion of the BBC meant this never occurred.\nThe original building is a Grade II* listed building.\n\n\n== Renovation ==\nBeginning in 2003, Broadcasting House underwent a major renovation during the BBC's W1 Programme, with the aim of refurbishing the building and combining a number of the BBC's operations in a new extension. This houses the television and radio operations of BBC News, relocated from Television Centre, and the BBC World Service, which relocated from Bush House on 12 July 2012. Many of the BBC's national radio stations are also broadcast from the building, with the exception of BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra which have moved to Salford Quays. The building work was completed in two phases. It began with the demolition of two post-war extensions to the original building.\n\n\"The redevelopment was part of a wider cost-saving strategy to consolidate the BBC's property portfolio and centralise its London operation. This will ultimately produce savings of more than £700m over the remaining 21-year life of the BBC lease on Broadcasting House.\"\n\n\n=== First phase ===\n\nThe first phase consisted of the renovation of the original building, which was starting to show its age and needed structural repair, and a new wing to the east.\nIn the old building, the sloped \"cat slide\" slate roof was removed and many of the rooms stripped back to their walls, although much of the Art Deco architecture was retained and preserved. Much of the work focused on the lower walls and ceilings, which did not include Art Deco features. The reception area was renovated to include a new desk while retaining the message and statue as an attention piece. Many rooms had ceilings removed, such as the south tower, and new reinforcement joists were added.\n\nThe new Egton Wing is roughly the same shape as the main building, with a modern design and window arrangement but retaining features such as Portland stone. Towards the rear a large block was created in the side, mirroring that created in the main building when the sloping roof was removed.\nThe design of the extension, intended to equal the original in \"architectural creativity\", was carried out by MacCormac Jamieson Prichard. Construction was completed in 2005, with the refurbished Broadcasting House and new Egton wing opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 April 2006 as part of her 80th birthday celebrations. All areas of the Egton Wing were fully fitted out and completed by 2007.\nIn 2012, it was announced by the then Director-General Mark Thompson that the Egton Wing would be renamed the 'John Peel Wing' to commemorate the late Radio 1 disc jockey, whom he described as a \"great radio talent\". Thompson described the wing as a \"fitting tribute to a man who personified so much of what the BBC stands for\".\n\nIt houses BBC London, BBC Arabic Television and BBC Persian Television, together with the reception area for BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 1Xtra.\n\n\n=== Second phase ===\n\nThe second phase was the creation of the large wing to the rear of the building, joining the two buildings, and creating a plaza between them. The original architects were replaced for not agreeing to cost-related revisions, as Sir Richard MacCormac was unwilling to sacrifice the quality of his design. Construction was completed by Bovis Lend Lease in 2010, and control handed over to the BBC in 2011. While the rebuilding process was under way, many BBC radio stations moved to other buildings near Portland Place.\nThe extension contains the BBC News and Journalism departments, and state-of-the-art technical equipment and new studios to house the BBC News bulletins on television, the BBC News Channel and BBC World News, the BBC Arabic Television service and the BBC Persian Television service. At the heart of this is a new newsroom, the largest live newsroom in the world.\nA walkway above the newsroom allows the public to view the work of journalists, connecting the foyer to the Radio Theatre and a new café for staff and the public. Complemented by the outdoor plaza, which could act as an outdoor arena and theatre, this is designed to engage the public with the television and radio making process. The extension is glass-covered in the plaza area and curved to contrast both wings either side and to continue the glass on both sides high up the building. On the Portland Place side, it continues the same use of Portland stone and glass as with the John Peel Wing.\nOn Monday 18 March 2013 at 1 pm, following the BBC News Channel's final broadcast from Television Centre, the first news programme from Broadcasting House was aired: the BBC News at One, on BBC One and the BBC News Channel. BBC World News was the first of BBC's news services to move into the new building on Monday 14 January 2013, beginning with GMT at noon.\nQueen Elizabeth II officially opened the extension on 7 June 2013. The second phase development won the 'Programme of the Year' award at the 2013 annual awards of the Association for Project Management.\n\n\n== Studios ==\n\n\n=== Original ===\nWhen built, Broadcasting House contained 22 radio studios for all programme genres, in the art-deco style with an emphasis on both looks and practicality. The practicality of the studios diminished rapidly as a result of the changing nature of broadcasting and changes in the required uses of the studios. These studios and their original intended roles were:\n\n\n=== Current ===\nFollowing the rebuild and refurbishment, several studios have been added and the studio structure changed dramatically. The current studios are:\n\n\n==== Radio studios ====\n\n\n==== Television studios ====\n\nUntil programmes air information is subject to change. All times listed are either Greenwich Mean Time or British Summer Time depending on what is being used in London.\n\n\n== Artworks ==\n\nThe building showcases works of art, most prominently the statues of Prospero and Ariel (from Shakespeare's The Tempest) by Eric Gill. Their choice was fitting since Prospero was a magician and scholar, and Ariel a spirit of the air, in which radio waves travel. There was, reportedly, controversy over some features of the statues when built and they were said to have been modified.  They were reported to have been sculpted by Gill as God and Man, rather than Prospero and Ariel, and that there is a small carved picture of a beautiful girl on the back of Prospero.  Additional carvings of Ariel are on the exterior in many bas-reliefs, some by Gill, others by Gilbert Bayes. The reception area contains a statue of 'The sower' by Gill.\nThe statues of Prospero and Ariel have attracted controversy in recent years, due to evidence that Gill engaged in pedophilia, and that the sculptor's sexuality might be reflected in the statue. The BBC has declined to remove the statue, citing Gill's status as one of the preeminent British artists of the 20th century. On 13 January 2022, the statue was vandalized by a man wielding a hammer, who wrote \"Time to go was 1989\" and \"noose all paedos\" on the statue.\nSeveral works of art were commissioned by the BBC for the refurbishment of Broadcasting House, at an overall cost of more than £4 million. Among these is World, a pavement artwork by the Canadian-born architect and artist Mark Pimlott. According to the BBC, the work \"reflects the global dimension of the BBC’s broadcasting and consists of over 750 stone flags inscribed with place names from around the world, as well as those from history, mythology and fantasy. The artwork is enhanced by elegant steel lines of longitude and latitude, a subtle scheme of small embedded lights and some audio installation linked to key output from the World Service.\"\nOn the roof of the John Peel wing, mirroring the radio mast, is Breathing, a cone-shaped glass structure reaching into the sky to the same height as the mast. It was sculpted by Jaume Plensa as a memorial to journalists killed in the line of duty. It includes words from a poem by James Fenton and is illuminated day and night. At 10 pm daily, in line with the BBC News at Ten, a column of light shines 900 metres (3,000 ft) into the sky. It was officially unveiled on 16 June 2008, by the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.\n\n\n== Broadcasting House in literature ==\nThe earliest use of Broadcasting House as a setting in fiction would seem to be in the 1934 detective novel Death at Broadcasting House by Val Gielgud and Holt Marvell (Eric Maschwitz), where an actor is found strangled in Studio 7C. Broadcasting House is a central feature in Penelope Fitzgerald's novel Human Voices, published in 1980, where the lead characters work for the BBC during the Second World War. It is also the work place of Alexander Wedderburn in A. S. Byatt's 1995 novel Still Life, and Sam Bell in Ben Elton's 1999 novel Inconceivable, and also that of the evil nazi-sympathiser Ezzy Pound in Michael Paraskos's 2016 novel In Search of Sixpence. The building is well realised as a setting in Nicola Upson's 2015 mystery novel London Rain.\n\n\n== George Orwell ==\n\nThe head of BBC history, Robert Seatter, has said George Orwell in his novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949), \"reputedly based his notorious Room 101 from the novel \"on a room he had worked in whilst at the BBC.\"\nOn 7 November 2017, a statue of Orwell, sculpted by the British sculptor Martin Jennings, was unveiled, outside Broadcasting House. The wall behind the statue is inscribed with the following phrase: \"If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear\". These are words from his proposed preface to Animal Farm and a rallying cry for the idea of free speech in an open society.\n\n\n== MI5 involvement ==\nIn 1985 it was revealed by The Observer that MI5 had had a special office in the building from 1937 for the purpose of vetting BBC employees for national security purposes.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of BBC properties\nBBC Television Centre\nBush House\nGranada TV Studios, Manchester\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nBroadcasting House at BBC Online\nHistory of the BBC – Broadcasting House at BBC Online\nPress Office Key Facts – 1932 Broadcasting House at BBC Online\nBroadcasting House – a potted history\nOld BBC Radio Broadcasting Equipment and Memories – Broadcasting House in 1932\nHistoric England. \"Details from listed building database (1265570)\".

Some C18, C19 and C20 alterations. It is the survival of early fabric that warrants the higher grade. To the rear is a C19 outbuilding, originally a workshop, used in the mid-1970s by the then newly-formed Sex Pistols and retaining related graffiti.\n    \n\n                    \n\n\n    \n        Reasons for Designation\n    \n    \n        No 6 Denmark Street, a terraced house of c1690, with former workshop to the rear, is listed at Grade II* for the following principal reasons:\n*  Architectural interest: the building is a rare, well-preserved, example of its type, reflecting the architectural fashions of the late C17, and preceding the patterns of urban terraced housing which followed in subsequent centuries;\n*  Level of survival: the building retains its historic floor-plan and much of its original exterior and interior character with a hierarchy of original panelling, plasterwork and joinery, as well as later fabric of historic note;\n*  Historic interest (building type): forming part of an early domestic terrace, with a later workshop to the rear, the building demonstrates evolving patterns of occupation in this central London location;\n*  Historic interest (music industry): the graffiti of John Lydon in the outbuilding to the rear is a rare example of the cultural phenomenon of Punk Rock, captured in the physical fabric of a building; it is also a wider testament to Denmark Street's C20 history at the heart of British popular music production during one of its most creative and influential periods.\n\n    \n\n                    \n\n\n        \n            History\n        \n        \n            No 6 Denmark Street is one of eight surviving late-C17 terraced houses built as part of the development of Denmark Street between 1686 and 1691.Situated in the Parish of St Giles, the name of Denmark Street commemorates the marriage in 1683 of Princess, later Queen, Anne, younger daughter of James, Duke of York, to Prince George of Denmark. The street is aligned from east to west from the corner of the churchyard of St Giles-in-the-Fields to Charing Cross Road, and runs across the site of the former St Giles Hospital.The street was developed by Samuel Fortrey and Jaques Wiseman. In 1686 Fortrey and Wiseman presented a petition to the Westminster Commissioners of Sewers, asking for permission to rebuild the sewer in Hog Lane (the line of the present Charing Cross Road) and lead a sewer from their new houses to it. The petition stated that they were to build about twenty houses in all, indicating the development of the whole street. Fortrey died in 1689, but a further petition to the commissioners by his brother and administrator, William Fortrey, in January 1691 shows that all the houses in Denmark Street were by then completed. Fortrey and Wiseman were not craftsmen themselves, so it is possible the individual freeholds were sold to several different builders who were responsible for the actual construction of the houses.Built for the middle classes, it is not clear how long the houses maintained this status. The St Giles Rookery - a notorious slum - blighted parts of the parish during the C18 and C19, and certainly by the C19 the houses began to shift towards commercial uses, with metal-working businesses becoming a particular feature of the street in the later part of the century. Ground floors became shops, while upper floors were used as workshops or living accommodation. A number of C19 outbuildings which survive to the rear of the frontage buildings are associated with this changing character.Commercial uses continued into the C20, but the second half of the century marked a particularly notable chapter in the street's history, becoming the centre of London’s, and by extension, Britain’s, music industry, gaining it the moniker ‘Tin Pan Alley’. Music publishers and sellers of sheet music appeared on the street prior to the Second World War, and it was on Denmark Street that 'Melody Maker', one of the earliest weekly music newspapers, was founded in 1926. But it was during the post-Second World War period that the street had its heyday at the heart of a thriving industry; post-war photographs and films indicate virtually every building and shop in the street had a function connected to music. Denmark Street was known for its recording studios and music shops (the Rolling Stones recorded their first album at Regent Sound Studios at No 4) but perhaps the most significant business was that of music publishing, a field dominated in particular by very successful Jewish entrepreneurs. Numerous music publishing offices acted as the headquarters for aspiring songwriters to publish and place their songs. Among Britain’s now internationally significant writers with a particularly strong connection to Denmark Street are David Bowie, Elton John, Ray Davies, and the Sex Pistols, artists who have all had a considerable influence on the course of Britain’s post-war popular culture as well as its music.Post Office directories of the 1950s and 1960s show a variety of tenants at No 6. It was the long-term home of \"Zeno\", a Greek book seller, which occupied the ground-floor shop unit, and other tenants included tailors, neon sign makers, and various music publishers, engravers and composers; at one time the building had six different businesses registered.OUTBUILDING TO THE REAR OF No. 6\nThe building to the rear of No 6 is a former workshop, likely built for a silversmith, but it also has a notable historic interest connected with Denmark Street’s position at the centre of the post-war music industry.\nWhen music svengali Malcolm McLaren needed a base from which to develop his new group, the Sex Pistols, he leased, on the suggestion of bass guitarist Glen Matlock, the outbuilding at No 6 for that purpose from amateur musician Bill Collins, a former Beatles roadie and manager of the group Badfinger (and also father of actor and musician Lewis Collins). From c1975 to 1977 the outbuilding doubled up as both a much needed rehearsal studio and living quarters for the Sex Pistols. The downstairs room was used as a studio to record key early Sex Pistols demos, with the mixing desk upstairs on guitarist Steve Jones’ bed (these early recordings are also known as the Dave Goodman demos, and form the basis of the infamous Spunk bootleg record and some of the group’s later legitimate recordings). Initially Steve Jones and Glen Matlock lived in the upstairs room, according to Matlock’s autobiography, the outbuilding… “did give us somewhere to live away from our parents, a first real taste of independence. And it meant we had a regular rehearsal space – which we used nearly every day. Maybe we’d only do half an hour before sloping off but, bit by bit, we were able to put a set together.”The band left their mark on the outbuilding; the upstairs room contains drawings and graffiti made directly on the walls by John Lydon (aka Johnny Rotten). The building was subsequently used as a rehearsal space for The Rich Kids (Matlock’s post-Pistols band), possibly the post-punk band 4” Be 2” (formed by John Lydon’s brother Jimmy), and in 1980-81 it was the home of Keren Woodward and Sara Dallin of Bananarama. Later layers of graffiti were added to Lydon’s work by these occupants; all of it discussed in greater detail by Paul Graves-Brown and John Schofield in their article for Antiquity magazine (see Sources below).ADDITIONAL NOTES ON THE MUSIC INDUSTRY AND DENMARK STREET\nDavid Bowie: a well-documented frequent visitor to Denmark Street in the early part of his career, to an extent where he is rumoured to have sometimes camped in a second hand ambulance van in the street. The van belonged to a band called The Lower Third with whom Bowie (then under his real name David Jones) joined forces with in 1965. Within weeks of this meeting David Jones had changed his name to David Bowie.Elton John: worked at a music publishers at No 20. He wrote “Your Song” his first hit single, in Denmark Street itself.The Kinks: were signed to a Denmark Street music publisher known as Eddie Kassner, with whom Ray Davies spectacularly fell out over the matter of royalties. This story is partly documented in the classic Kinks song “Denmark Street” from their album about the British music industry “Lola vs Powerman and The Moneygoround Part One”. The song “Denmark Street” forms part of the current West End hit musical “Sunny Afternoon”. The Kinks articulate and genre-defining hit singles hugely influenced Britpop and sold in very large quantities.The Sex Pistols: the group both lived in and rehearsed to the rear of No 6 during their early, formative, years when they single-handedly defined what became known as Punk Rock, a movement that caught the nation’s undivided attention, and was to prove highly influential from 1976 onwards.\n\n        \n        \n            Details\n        \n        \n            MATERIALS: No 6 is of red brick construction with stucco to the ground floor. Windows and doors are timber.\nPLAN: it is a three-bay, three-storey terraced house with attic and basement. The pitched roofs, with a dormer window to the front, are masked by a later brick parapet. The original late-C17 floor plan survives almost fully intact. This comprises a front and back room on each floor, heated by side-wall stacks (the fireplaces in the back rooms being set across the back corner). Towards the rear of the building a dog-leg stair is set against the opposing side wall. A closet wing to the rear of the building is a C20 rebuilding.EXTERIOR: the upper two storeys have ranges of three two-over-two pane sash windows with exposed sash boxes. The windows have splayed flat brick arches with painted central keystones and those on the first-floor have been extended downwards. There are string courses above ground- and first-floor windows. Unlike elsewhere on the street where the ground floor arrangement of a door and two windows has been replaced with a shopfront, at No 6, and its neighbour, No 7, the original arrangement survives, albeit with the brickwork rendered and the window openings extended downward. The windows of No 6 are glazed in sheet glass. The doorcase is of early-C19 date with pilasters supporting a projecting cornice, and above the fielded six-panel door is a radial fanlight.INTERIOR: throughout the building there is a good survival of original, C18, and C19, joinery and plasterwork. Box cornices survive widely and wall panelling is reflective of the house's relative hierarchy; from bolection moulded panelling in the hall and on the first floor, to simple timber boarding in the basement and attic. The lower part of the stair has column and vase balusters with a cut string and decorative console-like brackets beneath the treads, a likely C18 insertion. From the half landing between first and second floors upwards the stair has its original moulded closed string with barley twist balusters. The basement stair has heavy turned balusters, seemingly of early date, but perhaps repurposed given their location. The fully-panelled ground floor front room has an anthemion frieze and alcoves to either side of the fireplace with moulded arches resting on carved console brackets (one bracket is missing to the right). Principal rooms have panelled window-shutters, and fireplaces of various date survive on all three floors.OUTBUILDING: the outbuilding to the rear of No 6 faces onto the small courtyard between the two. The outbuilding is of brick construction (now painted), two storeys high, with a flat roof. At ground floor there is a door to one side and a pair of large segmental-headed windows with multi-paned, horizontally-sliding Yorkshire sashes. At first floor is a single wide window, formed of what would have been three pairs of timber casements, separated by timber mullions, however one of the three pairs has been replaced by a single sheet of glass.The interior of the building is simple and modernised, without features associated with its use as a workshop. It comprises a single room on the ground and first floors, linked by a modern open-tread stair. On the first floor three of the four walls are covered in an unplastered, unpainted board material. Applied directly onto the surface with marker pen are a number of drawings and a quantity of written graffiti by John Lydon, including unflattering caricatures of members of the band and their circle. Caricatures include the band’s manager Malcolm McLaren, who is depicted grasping a handful of bank notes with the name ‘Muggerage’ [a reference to Malcolm Muggeridge, contemporary broadcaster and born-again Christian]. Also on the wall is Nancy Spungen, girlfriend of John Ritchie (Sid Vicious). She is depicted in the nude with a cigarette in her mouth and a stubbled chin; her eyes are characteristically lined heavily with khol. She is re-christened as ‘Nanny Spunger’. Sid Vicious appears as a wild-haired, buck-toothed stick man named 'Ego Sloshos', and Steve Jones is named as ‘Fatty Jones’. There are eight cartoons by Lydon in total, including a self portrait.

All Saints Church, opposite, was a landmark both in the Gothic Revival and in Ecclesiology.  Its clergy house and choir school, built at the same time, between 1849 and 1853, created a tough urban architecture of brick, with polychrome diaper decoration, and stone banding.  The parish school, opened in 1870, cost ?5000, and is in an assertive style, more demonstrative than with the earlier buildings, with which it nevertheless shows an affinity by association, by architect, and group value.SOURCES:\nThe Architect, Aug 20, 1870, p.14\nThe Builder, Nov 4, 1871\nPevsner, N.

Stucco with\n          rusticated ground floor and rusticated quoin strip between  \n          No.99 & 98 (qv). Bands at 1st and 3rd floor level.          \n          EXTERIOR: 4 storeys and basement (4th storey a later        \n          addition). 5 windows. Symmetrical front; square-headed      \n          entrance with stone architraves, console bracketed          \n          cornice-hood and double panelled doors with patterned       \n          fanlight. Square-headed, recessed sash windows with exposed \n          boxing. Cornice and blocking course.                        \n          Rear elevation, apart from added top storey, retains its    \n          original appearance. Plum coloured stocks with red dressings.\n          3 windows between closet wings which have their own north   \n          windows at each floor and blind window recesses at the sides.\n          Windows and recesses with gauged flat arches except at      \n          basement and top floor where they are cambered. Deep window \n          sills of stone except for the ground floor centre opening   \n          below which the small set-forward of the basement storey is \n          raised to form a panel; this central window emphasised by a \n          stone bolection moulded architrave surmounted by a shaped   \n          frieze and wood cornice.                                    \n          INTERIOR: the plan of the interior is a prototype of the early\n          Georgian large town house. The 3-bay, front-lit, entrance hall\n          rises through the ground and 1st floor with the main stair of\n          3 flights set around a large well with the upper landing on \n          the east side. Stair with twisted balusters to a closed     \n          string, with half balusters on the square newels and moulded\n          handrail. Chequered black and white marble hall floor. Ovolo\n          panelling in 4 heights with 2 heights and a dado rail to the\n          upper landing with box cornice. Central on north wall, an oval\n          window to the secondary stairs. Ceiling painting above stairs,\n          on plaster, depicting Bacchus and Ariadne, attended by 2    \n          cupids, seen in the sky through an architectural margin     \n          representing a cornice and consoles in perspective. Attributed\n          to Louis Cheron and unusual in a house of this type in London.\n          A secondary, dog-leg, staircase runs from the basement to 3rd\n          floor behind the main stair (and separated from it by a     \n          panelled screen), lit by small light well at the rear. Twisted\n          balusters to a closed string with half balusters to the square\n          newels except in the 2 flights to the basement. Panelled dado\n          for full height. The ground floor back room (The Peacock Room)\n          extends the full width of the house and is lined with bold  \n          raised bolection moulded panelling with dado rail and box   \n          cornice. The rest of the house retains fine panelling and   \n          features with minor alterations.                            \n          HISTORICAL NOTE: the house has been in professional use since\n          1820 when it was taken by the Regents Canal Company who may \n          have been responsible for the extra storey and re-fronting. \n          (RCHME: London, Vol. II, West London: London: -1925: 60).

Square headed doorway to right with vermiculated Gibbs surround to modern double part-glazed doors with side lights and fanlight over. Canted bay to ground floor; front area with railings. All windows now with plate glass sashes, under flat gauged arches to upper floors. 1st floor plat bands. Parapets with stone copings. Continuous cast iron balconies to 1st floor, probably later C.19, with curved wrought iron S-scrolls. \nINTERIOR: altered and extended to rear in later C19, now contains a mix of original features and Early Georgian-style features of Victorian date, as well as a number of notable sculptural items inserted as part of the fabric. Features of interest include the following items. Basement: plain doors and surrounds remain; front south room with slanted light in wall. Ground floor: hall with marble squares to floor, stone armorial cartouche in frame to left of door, wrought iron radiator grille with decorative L's in Louis XV style below stairs, landscape painting attached to wall. Ground floor front room with elaborate Baroque style oak bookshelf, Kentian white marble chimneypiece with shell and floral husk motif. Mahogany doors and Kent-style doorcases throughout main floors. Ground floor central room with Rococo ceiling, Kentian chimneypiece with Porturo marble columns, Ionic screen, in-built buffet incorporating mid-16th century classical relief of draped figures flanking armorial cartouches. Rear addition contains room with statuary marble chimneypiece yellow jasper marble insets and meander pattern frieze. Inner (west-facing) front of mews house to rear is embellished with continental wrought iron window grilles, a relief of the lion of St Mark, and a rusticated arched window surround with carved keystone. Open, top-lit stone cantilevered staircase with Louis XV-style ironwork of unclear date, with unusual passing places at mid-flight and on the main landing. Staircase sports a number of sculptural items set into wall: a pair of marble tondi, probably Italian and c.1600, representing a pope and a bishop (presumably from a series showing Fathers of the Church); a pair of Atlantes, probably 16th century, and at top an ecclesiastical Baroque armorial cartouche. First floor rooms also of high quality. Front room (currently sub-divided) with fine Rococo ceiling, Georgian statuary marble chimneypiece with Ionic columns, a central round relief of cherubs, and insets of verde antico marble. First floor central room with fine Rococo ceiling, modillion cornice, statuary marble chimneypiece with tapering fluted pilasters, paterae and urn reliefs, central relief of acanthus-tailed cherubs flanking urn. Room in rear extension includes statuary marble chimneypiece with fluted pilasters, urns and paterae reliefs, central relief of acanthus tailed cherubs flanking urn. Upper floors of less interest and considerably altered. HISTORY: Built in the mid-1770s as part of the Portland Estate development, this house retains fine ceilings and chimneypieces from this time: the plasterer Thomas Collins, a regular associate of William Chambers, was involved with this development. The house was considerably altered late in the 19th century. It was occupied by Frederick Cavendish-Bentinck early in the 20th century who may have been responsible for the installation of the sculptural items. A prestigious mid-Georgian town house possessing an interior of considerable interest. \n\n        \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n    \n        Legacy\n    \n    \n        The contents of this record have been generated from a legacy data system.\n    \n    \n        \n            Legacy System number:\n            \n                489723\n            \n        \n        \n            Legacy System:\n            \n                LBS\n            \n        \n    \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n\n\n\n                    \n                        \n\n\n    \n        Legal\n    \n\n\n    \n        This building is listed under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as amended for its special architectural or historic interest.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n\n            \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n            \n                Map\n            \n            \n                This map is for quick reference purposes only and may not be to scale.

    "wikipedia_text": "Liberty, commonly known as Liberty's, is a luxury department store in London, England. It is located on Great Marlborough Street in the West End of London. The building spans from Carnaby Street on the East to Kingly Street on the West, where it forms a three storey archway over the Northern entrance to the Kingly Street mall that houses the Liberty Clock in its centre. Liberty is known around the world for its close connection to art and culture, but it is most famous for its bold and floral print fabrics. The vast mock-Tudor store also sells men's, women's and children's fashion, beauty and homewares from a mix of high-end and emerging brands and labels.\nThe store is known to spot and champion young designers at the start of their careers, and many now-prominent brands were first available at Liberty. The store played essential role in spreading and popularizing the Modern Style. This continues Liberty's long reputation for working with British artists and designers. Liberty’s makes a cameo appearance in Enola Holmes.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nArthur Lasenby Liberty was born in Chesham, Buckinghamshire, in 1843. He was employed by Messrs Farmer & Rogers in Regent Street in 1862, the year of the International Exhibition. By 1874, rejected for a partnership, and imbued by his 10 years experience, he decided to start a business of his own. With a £2,000 loan from his future father-in-law, in 1875, he accepted the lease of half a shop at 218a Regent Street with three staff members.\nThe shop sold ornaments, fabric and objets d'art, especially from Japan and the East. Within eighteen months, he had repaid the loan and acquired the second half of 218 Regent Street. As the business grew, neighbouring properties were bought and added. In 1884, he introduced the costume department, directed by Edward William Godwin (1833–1886), a distinguished architect and a founding member of The Costume Society. He and Arthur Liberty created in-house apparel to challenge the fashions of Paris.\nIn 1885, 142–144 Regent Street was acquired and housed the ever-increasing demand for carpets and furniture. The basement was named the Eastern Bazaar, and it was the vending place for what was described as \"decorative furnishing objects\". He named the property Chesham House, after the place in which he grew up. The store became the most fashionable place to shop in London, and Liberty fabrics were used for both clothing and furnishings. \n\nIn November 1885, Liberty brought forty-two villagers from India to stage a living village of Indian artisans. Liberty's specialised in Oriental goods, in particular imported Indian silks, and the aim of the display was to generate both publicity and sales for the store. In 1889, Oscar Wilde, a regular client of the store, wrote \"Liberty's is the chosen resort of the artistic shopper\".\nDuring the 1890s, Liberty built strong relationships with many English designers. Many of these designers, including Archibald Knox, practised the artistic styles known as Arts and Crafts and Art Nouveau, and Liberty helped develop Art Nouveau through his encouragement of such designers. The company became associated with this new style, to the extent that in Italy, Art Nouveau became known as the Stile Liberty, after the London shop.\n\n\n=== 1920s ===\nThe Tudor revival building was built so that trading could continue while renovations were being completed on the other premises, and in 1924, this store was constructed from the timbers of two ships: HMS Impregnable (formerly HMS Howe) and HMS Hindustan. The frontage on Great Marlborough Street is the same length as the Hindustan. It became a Grade II* listed building in 1972.\nThe emporium was designed by Edwin Thomas Hall and his son, Edwin Stanley Hall. They designed the building at the height of the 1920s fashion for Tudor revival. The shop was engineered around three light wells that formed the main focus of the building. Each of these wells was surrounded by smaller rooms to create a homey feel. Many of the rooms had fireplaces and some still exist.\nThe architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner was very critical of the building's architecture, saying: \"The scale is wrong, the symmetry is wrong. The proximity to a classical façade put up by the same firm at the same time is wrong, and the goings-on of a store behind such a façade (and below those twisted Tudor chimneys) are wrongest of all\".\nArthur Liberty died in 1917, seven years before the completion of his shops.\n\n\n=== Post-war ===\nLiberty, during the 1950s, continued its tradition for fashionable and eclectic design. All departments in the shop had a collection of both contemporary and traditional designs. New designers were promoted and often included those still representing the Liberty tradition for handcrafted work.\nIn 1955, Liberty began opening several regional stores in other UK cities; the first of these was in Manchester. Subsequent shops opened in Bath, Brighton, Chester, York, Kingston upon Thames, Exeter and Norwich.\nDuring the 1960s, extravagant and Eastern influences once again became fashionable, as well as the Art Deco style, and Liberty adapted its furnishing designs from its archive.\nIn 1996, Liberty announced the closure of its twenty shops outside London, and instead focused on smaller outlets at airports.\nSince 1988, Liberty has had a subsidiary in Japan which sells Liberty-branded products in major Japanese shops. It also sells Liberty fabrics to international and local fashion stores with bases in Japan.\n\n\n=== 2000s ===\nLiberty's London store was sold for £41.5 million (equivalent to £70.3 million in 2023) and then leased back by the firm in 2009, to pay off debts ahead of a potential sale of the company. Subsequently, in 2010, Liberty was taken over by private equity firm BlueGem Capital, in a deal worth £32 million (equivalent to £51.8 million in 2023). In 2019 BlueGem sold their controlling (40%) stake to a consortium of private equity groups led by Glendower Capital.\n\n\n== TV documentary ==\nFrom 2 December 2013, Liberty was the focus of a three-part hour-long episode TV documentary series titled Liberty of London, airing on Channel 4.

Some later alterations including modern pub front. EXTERIOR: a red brick building with stone banding and dressings in a Flemish Renaissance style. Its narrow frontage rises to four storeys plus a two storey gable, behind which is the steeply pitched slate roof. All the windows are timber sashes; some have transoms with coloured glass. The ground floor pub front and fascia are entirely modern but the pink granite corner pilasters with decorative consoles survive and above ground floor the building is largely unaltered. The first and second floor are defined by round-headed niches to the outer bays and a central canted bay window with pink granite colonettes, carved frieze and a gable feature breaking through into the third floor. The third and fourth storeys each have three segmental headed windows and the shaped gable to fourth and fifth floors has a broken pediment at its apex. INTERIOR: not only survives extremely well, but also contains decorative elements that are more than special. The mahogany pilastered panelling, large fireplace with overmantle, colourful tiled frieze with swirling foliage, moulded cornice and heavily moulded ceiling with skylight are as robustly detailed and exuberant as those in the best late C19 public houses. The decorative panels mounted in the panelling are even rarer survivals and have more than special quality. There are three back-painted mirrors with ribbons, cherubs and cornucopia by Jones and Firmin who reintroduced this technique for decorating glass in the 1880s. There are panels of encaustic tiles depicting flowering urns by Millington, Wisdom and Co, Art Tile Painters of Shaftesbury Avenue. And there are three painted canvases of the Seasons, plump allegorical figures carrying pheasants, grapes and flowers, signed by Felix de Jong and Co (the fourth has been lost). The ceiling also contains painted roundels depicting Classical scenes, also by de Jong. The interior is relatively unaltered. While the bar is new, modern coloured glass inserted into the large octagonal skylight at the rear, and partitions have been removed to create a single open space of what were once at least two rooms, this remains one of the best-surviving late Victorian pub interiors in the country. HISTORY: The Flying Horse was redeveloped on the site of an older pub at the same time as the large neighbouring block on the corner of Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Street. Although the two buildings were commissioned and erected simultaneously, there was never any interconnection between them and they remain separate addresses. Both are in the Flemish Renaissance style popular for commercial buildings and public houses at the end of the C19, a style which also suited the narrow plot widths on Oxford Street that had prevailed from the Georgian development of the road. When the Flying Horse was built it was located a few doors down from the Oxford Street Music Hall and there is something of the palace of varieties about its interior; indeed the decorators De Jong and Co were also employed at Frank Matcham's Hackney Empire.The Baker Bros were the late C19 publicans par excellence. William Henry and Richard Baker came to London from Devon with a few shillings between them and gradually built an empire of lavish public houses and hotels. The Flying Horse was one of their first speculations and they ran it personally from 1892-97; the adjoining building at 1a Tottenham Court Road was their offices. Although their enterprises ended in financial ruin, in the late 1890s they were masters of premises across London and several hotels in Leicester Square and the West End including the Grand Café de l'Europe, all but the latter designed by Saville and Martin who were pub specialists. Both became very rich and William, who rose to Lieutenant-Colonel in the Honourable Artillary Company, was considered to be 'a rather dandified man'; Richard was (according to Mark Girouard) 'flashier and financially closer to the wind'. This is the best-surviving of their remaining public houses. REASONS FOR DESIGNATION: The Flying Horse Public House is listed at Grade II* for the following principal reasons:\n*   its splendid interior which is one of the best-preserved in London and includes mirrors, mahogany panelling, an ornate fireplace and overmantle, ceramic frieze and embossed ceilings; \n*   other elements of the décor are more than special survivals, in particular the paintings of the Four Seasons and ceiling panels, by De Jong and Co, the back-painted mirrors by Jones and Firmin and the panels of encaustic tiles depicting flowering urns by Millington, Wisdom and Co;\n*   the exterior architecture is strong too and the exuberant Flemish Renaissance style chosen by Saville and Martin suits this tall, narrow frontage \n*   one of the few remaining pubs built by the Baker Bros, who epitomises the boom and bust world of late C19 public house speculation and were men-about-town in their own day. \n        \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n    \n        Legacy\n    \n    \n        The contents of this record have been generated from a legacy data system.\n    \n    \n        \n            Legacy System number:\n            \n                422457\n            \n        \n        \n            Legacy System:\n            \n                LBS\n            \n        \n    \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n                    Sources\n                \n                \n                    Books and journalsBrandwood, G, Jephcote, J, London Heritage Pubs - An Inside Story, (2008)Girouard, M, Victorian Pubs, (1984)\n                \n\n\n\n                    \n                        \n\n\n    \n        Legal\n    \n\n\n    \n        This building is listed under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as amended for its special architectural or historic interest.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n\n            \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n            \n                Map\n            \n            \n                This map is for quick reference purposes only and may not be to scale.

The statue of Charles Haddon\n          Spurgeon by Derwent Wood which formerly stood on an inscribed\n          plinth under a niche in the entrance hall is now missing; the\n          entrance hall is pilastered and has a barrel vault, a ceiling\n          treatment which recurs throughout the ground and first floors.\n          Dog-leg stone tread stair in C17 manner with fat balusters and\n          handrail in wood to first floor; metal-work balustrade to   \n          stair on upper floors. Four interiors of very good quality  \n          inspected in September 1994: The original 2-storey Kingsgate\n          Chapel to the rear of the site was divided at gallery level in\n          1939. It is octagonal in plan with a dome finishing in a    \n          columned light monitor. Fine plaster ornament augmented by low\n          relief panels depicting varieties of British trees in an Arts\n          and Crafts manner by Lawrence Turner; the inside has recently\n          been sealed to the weather and fumigated. After it was divided\n          in two the top half of the Chapel became the Union's Council\n          Chamber. In 1939 the former Council Chamber became the      \n          'Shakespeare Room', named after the Union Secretary at the  \n          time the complex was built. This is a barrel-vaulted room of 3\n          bays on the first floor (now No.108) with splendid Arts and \n          Crafts plaster work by Lawrence Turner; the chimney piece is\n          made from polished alabaster and features a low relief      \n          terracotta plaque depicting Baptist missionaries liberating \n          aboriginals; this is signed Doulton of Lambeth and is said to\n          be by George Tinworth; wood panelling to lower walls; tympanum\n          of barrel vault opposite entrance bears low relief portrait \n          bust of Robert Hall in stone; Diocletian windows with original\n          leaded glazing. The former Committee Room is also on the first\n          floor (now No.107, it is found in the north-west corner): this\n          is entered via a short barrel-vaulted corridor which is top \n          glazed; in the side wall of this corridor is a plaque erected\n          at the time the building was completed recording those      \n          associated with the project; ceiling divided into nine      \n          compartments, the principal divisions ornamented by rich    \n          plasterwork; a second terracotta low relief plaque, also said\n          to be the work of Tinworth is set above the fireplace.      \n          Finally, there is the former Library on the second floor, now\n          room No.208, with wood panelling and an exceptionally fine  \n          chimney surround with inlaid wood and roundels in an Arts and\n          Crafts manner; the original book cases fixed to the walls   \n          survive; ceiling divided into 12 compartments, across 4 bays;\n          4 segmental-arched clerestory windows to east wall above    \n          library cases and two to the west wall; all windows with lead\n          glazing of an original design. The General Secretary's room,\n          said to have a plaster cornice with central pendant could not\n          be located, nor could the Visitor's Room with panelled ceiling\n          and cornice, although the rooms have been renamed and may be\n          those inspected. Many original doors survive, and several   \n          features from the 1939 refurbishment, including stair rails \n          and floors.                                                 \n          HISTORICAL NOTE: The British Council of Churches was        \n          inaugurated here in 1942.

    "wikipedia_text": "The Central School of Art and Design was a public school of fine and applied arts in London, England. It offered foundation and degree level courses. It was established in 1896 by the London County Council as the Central School of Arts and Crafts. Central became part of the London Institute in 1986, and in 1989 merged with Saint Martin's School of Art to form Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Central School of Arts and Crafts was established in 1896 by the London County Council. It grew directly from the Arts and Crafts movement of William Morris and John Ruskin. The first principal – from 1896 to 1900 as co-principal with George Frampton – was the architect William Richard Lethaby, from 1896 until 1912; a blue plaque in his memory was erected in 1957. He was succeeded in 1912 by Fred Burridge.\n\nThe school was at first housed in Morley Hall, rented from the Regent Street Polytechnic. In 1908 it moved to purpose-built premises in Southampton Row, in the London Borough of Camden. In the same year the Royal Female School of Art, established in 1842, was merged into the school.\nThe Central School of Arts and Crafts was renamed the Central School of Art and Design on 1 May 1966. It became part of the London Institute in 1986, and in 1989 merged with Saint Martin's School of Art to form Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design.\n\n\n== Alumni ==\n\nThe alumni of the Central School of Art and Design include:\n\nTerence Conran, designer and writer, founder of Habitat\nLucian Freud, painter\nEric Gill, artist and typographer\nKathleen Hale, artist and creator of Orlando the Marmalade Cat\nDavid Hicks, interior decorator and designer\nMike Leigh, film director, theatre director, writer\nBill Moggridge, designer of the first laptop computer\nVictor Pasmore, abstract artist\nVivian Stanshall, musician, of the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band\nJoe Strummer, musician, of The Clash\n\n\n== References =="

    "wikipedia_text": "The Princess Louise is a public house situated on High Holborn, a street in central London. Built in 1872, it is best known for its well-preserved 1891 Victorian interior, with wood panelling and a series of booths around an island bar. It is a tied house owned by the Samuel Smith Old Brewery of Tadcaster, Yorkshire.\n\n\n== About ==\nBeing located near Bloomsbury, the British Museum and the University of London, it is patronised by academics.\n\n\n== Building ==\nThe building is protected by its Grade II* listing and has what has been described as \"a rich example of a Victorian public house interior\", by William B Simpson and Sons; who contracted out the work. As it is considered so historically significant even the men's toilets, with their marble urinals, are listed. The pub, which is also listed on National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors, was refurbished in 2007. The pub is unusual in that it retains its snob screens.\nIn June 2009, the pub was joint winner of the best refurbishment class of the 2008 Pub Design Awards awarded annually by CAMRA. Author Peter Haydon included the Princess Louise in his book The Best Pubs in London and rated it No. 5 in the capital, saying it had \"possibly the best preserved Victorian pub interior in London\".\n\n\n== History ==\nThe pub was operated by Regent Inns from 1990 until 1998, when the lease was taken over by Samuel Smith.\nThe Princess Louise is also notable for having been the venue for a number of influential folk clubs run by Ewan MacColl and others, which played an important part in the British folk revival of the late 1950s and early 1960s.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nCAMRA National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors\nBeer in the Evening\npubs.com review"

    "wikipedia_text": "Connaught Hall is a fully catered hall of residence owned by the University of London and situated on Tavistock Square, Bloomsbury, London, UK. It is an intercollegiate hall, and as such provides accommodation for full-time students at constituent colleges and institutions of the University of London, including King's College, University College London (UCL), Queen Mary, the London School of Economics (LSE) and the School of Oriental and African Studies and others.\n\n\n== History ==\nConnaught Hall was established in 1919 by Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn – the third son of Queen Victoria – at 18 Torrington Square, London as a men-only private hall of residence; the Hall was intended as a memorial to the Duchess of Connaught who died in 1917. The Duke gave the Hall to the University of London in 1928. It was not until 1961 that Connaught Hall moved out of Torrington Square to its present location in Tavistock Square: a converted Georgian terrace with a Grade II listed façade. Connaught Hall accommodated only men until 2001, when it was changed to a mixed sex hall as part of a major review of the intercollegiate halls of residence.\n\n\n== Student population ==\n\nFor over 90 years, Connaught Hall accommodated only male students; female students were admitted for the first time in September 2001 as part of a wider review of the intercollegiate halls. Now one of eight University of London intercollegiate halls of residence, Connaught Hall accommodates 214 full-time students of the various colleges and institutes of the university; there is an even mix of men and women, and a diverse range of cultural and social backgrounds. The number of students from each college who are accommodated at Connaught Hall is determined from time to time by the Intercollegiate Accommodation Committee of the University of London, in negotiation with the accommodation offices of the individual colleges. The majority of residents are first-year undergraduates (\"freshers\"), and most will only ever spend one year in a hall of residence: around 10% are allowed to return for a second year at the Warden's discretion; these will usually be either students with special circumstances or those who have made an outstanding contribution to the Hall community. Approximately 10% of residents are postgraduates, and about a third are overseas students.\n\n\n== Accommodation and facilities ==\n\nMost accommodation is in single study-bedrooms (204 single rooms), but there are five twin rooms for students who prefer to share; every room has a washbasin, but toilet and shower facilities are all shared (20–25 students sharing one bathroom, each with three showers & two or three toilet stalls).  There are two television/common rooms, music room with a piano, restaurant, card-operated laundrette, secure bike store, courtyard garden and a study room. There is one vending machine for soft drinks, and a small pantry/kitchen on each floor, equipped with a refrigerator and microwave. The reception desk is open 24 hours a day; photocopying and fax services are available from reception for a fee.\nResidents are provided with a bedding pack (pillows, pillowcases, duvet, duvet cover, and sheets) at the start of the academic year at a fee. It is residents' own responsibility to launder their bed linen. The students' rooms are cleaned by housekeepers once a fortnight. Communal areas are cleaned every day.\n\nConnaught Hall is a fully catered hall of residence. Breakfast is served Monday-Friday, brunch on Saturdays and Sundays; dinner is served at 6pm daily.\n\n\n== Staff ==\nEach of the intercollegiate halls of residence is managed by a Hall Manager. Every hall also has a Warden and a number of student Resident Advisors. The Hall Managers and their staff work full-time during office hours; whereas the Wardens and Resident Advisors are part-time staff and volunteers who are either studying or working in academic or academic-related roles elsewhere in the University of London.\n\n\n=== Management staff ===\nHall Manager\nAssistant manager\nThe Hall Manager has overall management responsibility for the Hall's buildings, furnishings, and finances, and is responsible for the provision of catering, maintenance, telephone, Internet, housekeeping, and reception services. They also look after the Hall's commercial activities, including conferences, bed & breakfast, and group bookings.\nAccommodation matters (such as room allocations and waiting lists) are centralised at the Intercollegiate Halls Accommodation Bureau. The collection of accommodation fees is centralised to the finance office.\n\n\n=== Wardenial staff ===\nWarden\nFive student Resident Advisors (formerly Senior Members)\nThe Warden is a part-time member of staff resident within the Hall, responsible for welfare and pastoral care, discipline and conflict resolution, community and social life, the Residents' Club and Hall bar, out-of-hours emergencies, and student re-admissions. The Warden is usually a senior member of academic or academically related staff elsewhere within the University of London. The current Warden (since 2009) is Dr Adrian Clark, a specialist emergency physician within one of the university's teaching hospitals. Five student Resident Advisors – usually postgraduates or mature students – assist the Warden.\nStudents in Hall are often living away from home for the first time. They can encounter problems with loneliness, social isolation, bullying, conflicts related to religion or sexuality, depression, eating disorders, drug and alcohol abuse, self-harm and suicidal thoughts, as well as antisocial behaviour, noisy neighbours, theft, and damage to property. The Warden is available to offer front-line advice and support for students wrestling with problems such as these. The Warden also organises and oversees social events in the Hall and acts as a leader of the student community to help bind the resident population together.\nThe Warden (as Clerk to the Club & Senior Treasurer) supervises the elected Residents' Club Committee, which runs the Hall bar (which has been closed since the COVID-19 pandemic) and common rooms, and organises various social and sporting events throughout the year. The Warden is also a member of the Facilities Committee, which considers catering, security, housekeeping, health promotion, and general safety issues in Hall.\nThe Warden and Resident Advisors are all trained as fire marshals; most also have “first aid appointed person\" training. There is a Duty Resident Advisor on call at nights and weekends to deal with any emergencies while the Bursar's Office is closed.\n\n\n== Restructuring ==\nThe 1990s saw a decline in the number of university-employed staff in the Halls of residence, as contractors were engaged to provide most services such as cooking, cleaning, and maintenance. Since the early 2000s, the University of London has gradually centralised the management of the intercollegiate halls of residence. The number of Bursars has reduced from eight – one in every hall – to only two since 2010. In 2007, the contracts for all security, maintenance, catering, and housekeeping were taken away from individual hall Bursars to the management of a single contract manager based at Senate House (University of London).\nUntil July 2009, Connaught Hall had a Warden, a Vice-Warden (who was the Warden's deputy, served as the Senior Treasurer to the Residents' Club, and chaired the Facilities Committee), and four Senior Members. A costs and efficiency review of the student support structure in the intercollegiate halls lead to the abolition of the Vice-Warden post and an increase in the number of Senior Members. This was also the review that lead to accommodation matters being centralised to the Intercollegiate Halls Accommodation Bureau.\nIn May 2011, the University of London proposed to abolish all Warden and Vice-Warden posts across the intercollegiate halls of residence, leaving the Bursars in charge of student welfare, discipline, and social life in addition to their existing maintenance and administrative duties. An outcry from students in the Halls caused the proposal to be suspended, pending a further consultation due to commence in December 2011.\nIn the summer of 2012, the post of Bursar was abolished and another major restructuring of the management of the intercollegiate halls took place.\n\n\n== Residents' Club Committee ==\n\nThe Residents' Club Committee is made up of five elected Hall residents.\nThe Warden (as Clerk to the Club & Senior Treasurer) and appointed Bar Manager also sit on the committee.\nThe Residents' Club Committee is elected in October every year. Residents who want to stand for election need the support of two other residents to secure a nomination; after a short campaigning period, there a hustings is held in the Restaurant, where all the candidates are given five minutes to address the residents. Voting is by secret ballot immediately after the speeches. The Warden acts as Returning Officer, organising the elections and supervising the count, and then continues to oversee the committee's activities and financial management during the year.\n\nThe Committee runs the Hall bar and organises various social and sporting functions during the year, funded by the subscriptions which all residents pay; this income is also used to provide newspapers and magazines for residents' use. The elected members of the committee can also help represent residents' concerns and suggestions to members of staff.\nIt has become traditional for the Residents' Club Committee to organise certain events every year:\n\nA welcome party in the bar at the beginning of the first term.\nA Hallowe'en party on 31 October (or sometimes a Guy Fawkes' party on 5 November).\nDecorating the Christmas tree, with mulled wine and mince pies for everyone who helps.\nA Christmas party, usually on the same night as the eagerly anticipated special Christmas Dinner in the Restaurant (usually with wine, crackers, live music, and carol singing).\nA Valentine's party.\nA \"boat party\": hiring a boat on the Thames for the main party of the Connaught Hall year.\nA summer \"farewell\" party.\nA group photograph of all the residents\nEach Committee also finds its own special events or regular activities to organise; recent examples include football competitions, salsa classes, yoga, pool & table tennis tournaments, and coach trips to Paris and Amsterdam.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCollege Hall, London\nInternational Hall, London\n\n\n== External links ==\nInfo page on University of London website\nConnaught Hall residents' website\nPhotos of Connaught Hall at Flickr: inside and out\n\n\n== Sources ==\nConnaught Hall Residents' Handbook 2008–9, University of London (downloadable from Connaught Hall web page)\nConnaught Hall Supplementary Regulations 2008–9, University of London (downloadable from Connaught Hall web page)\nUniversity of London Intercollegiate Halls of Residence Licence Agreement 2008–9, University of London (downloadable from Connaught Hall web page)"

    "wikipedia_text": "The British Medical Association War Memorial, officially the War Memorial at British Medical Association House, Tavistock Square, Bloomsbury, London, commemorates men and women of the medical professions from the British Empire and Commonwealth who died in the Second World War. The memorial was commissioned by the British Medical Association and designed by the sculptor James Woodford.  Unveiled in 1954 by Sir John McNee, then President of the BMA, and dedicated by Geoffrey Fisher, the Archbishop of Canterbury, it became a Grade II* listed structure in 1998.\n\n\n== Site ==\nTavistock Square was first developed in 1806 by James Burton for Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford, as part of the latter's development of his Bedford Estate. Thomas Cubitt continued the construction of the western half of the square in 1825–26, following – though improving on – Burton's general design for the eastern frontages. The design for Cubitt's western façade (nos. 29–45) was undertaken by Lewis Vulliamy. The site of the present BMA House was originally the location of Tavistock House, whose residents had included Charles Dickens and, later, the singer Georgina Weldon.\nTavistock House was demolished in the early 20th century and from 1911, was replaced by the current building designed by Edwin Lutyens as the British headquarters of the Theosophical Society. The building was commandeered by the War Office during the First World War and by the 1920s, when it was returned to the Theosophists, the Society lacked the funds necessary for completion. The unfinished building was sold to the BMA in 1923, which at first re-engaged Lutyens, and subsequently employed Cyril Wontner-Smith, to complete it.  The BMA transferred its headquarters to the new building in 1925, having previously been based at 429 The Strand.  The new BMA House became a Grade II listed building in 1982.\n\n\n== History and description ==\n\nThe British and Commonwealth medical dead of World War I are commemorated by a 60 ft (18 m) wide wrought iron memorial screen with a central pair of gates and two side gates, installed between the east and west courtyards at BMA House.  Over the central gate is the BMA badge, a gilded serpent of Asclepius, and a shield with bearing the words MEMORY AND PRAISE on the west side and FAITHFUL HAVE BEEN YOUR WARFARE on the east side, with a dedication to 574 medical officers killed in the war on a separate plaque nearby.  The screen and gates were designed by Lutyens and made by the Birmingham Guild of Handicraft.  The World War I memorial was dedicated by Randall Davidson, Archbishop of Canterbury, on 13 July 1925, the day when the BMA's new building was officially opened by King George V and Queen Mary.  It is included in the Grade II listing of BMA House.   The gates were restored and rededicated in 1995, and restored again in 2014.\nAt the end of World War II, the BMA commissioned a second memorial from the sculptor James Woodford. Woodford, who trained at the Nottingham School of Art, the Royal College of Art and the British School at Rome, had established a reputation as a designer of architectural and heraldic sculpture. The memorial comprises a bronze fountain of intertwined serpents set in a lead-lined circular pool and surrounded by four statues representing \"Sacrifice\", \"Cure\", \"Prevention\" and \"Aspiration\". The statues and the fountain are of Portland stone and the grouping has a base constructed of York stone. The side of the stone fountain surround is inscribed with the words IN MEMORIAM 1939–1945, and a bronze dedicatory plaque reads IN HONOUR OF THE MEDICAL MEN AND WOMEN OF / THE BRITISH EMPIRE AND COMMONWEALTH OF NATIONS / WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR.  The whole stands within the building's east courtyard, the Court of Honour. It was unveiled by Sir John McNee, President of the BMA, on 2 November 1954. The dedication was given by Geoffrey Fisher, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Fisher's address spoke of \"these medical men [who] saved others, themselves they could not and would not save\". The World War II memorial was separately listed at Grade II* in 1998.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGrade II* listed war memorials in England\nGrade II* listed buildings in the London Borough of Camden\n\n\n== Footnotes, references and sources ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nCherry, Bridget; Pevsner, Nikolaus (2002).

Original central section of frontage five-window bays 1914-17 by Cecil C Brewer and A Dunbar Smith; southern extension of five bays with identical style of elevation 1936-8 by Edward Maufe; northern extension of seven bays   in a complementary idiom of 1961-2 by Fitzroy Robinson and Partners. Portland stone facing on a steel frame throughout. Pantiled mansard roof with dormers.  \n                       \nEXTERIOR: Four storeys, attic and basement. Central and southern section in stripped Classical style have free-standing octagonal columns with bronze bases and caps to ground floor carrying plain entablature. Plate glass display windows are set back behind an arcade. On upper storeys, piers rise above columns to abbreviated capitals and deep entablature having enriched cornice and incised Roman lettering with the dates MDCCCX, MCMXVI and MCMXXXVII and the name \"Heal and Son\" (twice). The voids between the piers in alternating rhythm of single and triple lights divided by stone pilasters and filled with close-paned steel windows for two storeys, and continuous steel windows recessed on the third storey. The spandrels between first and second floors carry cast metal panels in low relief with colour designed by Joseph Armitage and depicting various wares and implements, eg. textiles, sheep shears, a bed, teazle, pottery wheel and vase. The northern extension has a similar rhythm of bays and identical storey heights with the entablatures ranging through. Entrance in right hand bay with projecting hood bearing the royal coat of arms. Square piers to the ground floor, the set back display windows on the front and return to Torrington Place having curving non-reflective glass. Attic recessed with flat roof and projecting frame for window-cleaning cradle. The windows between piers of larger steel sections, the spandrels between first and second floors here filled with ceramic blue and cream relief panels designed by John Farleigh and made by Kenneth Clark and depicting wares interspersed with large letters \"H\" for Heals.              \n          \nINTERIOR: notable chiefly for the circular wooden staircase within a well at the rear of the store, built as part of the Smith and Brewer work in 1914-17. Both Heals and Habitat are entered through the 1960s building at ground-floor level and their plans are confusing on the other floors; they have no division corresponding to the periods of the building but over-and-undersail each over.                               \nListing NGR: TQ2953181906\n        \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n    \n        Legacy\n    \n    \n        The contents of this record have been generated from a legacy data system.\n    \n    \n        \n            Legacy System number:\n            \n                478388\n            \n        \n        \n            Legacy System:\n            \n                LBS\n            \n        \n    \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n\n\n\n                    \n                        \n\n\n    \n        Legal\n    \n\n\n    \n        This building is listed under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as amended for its special architectural or historic interest.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n\n            \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n            \n                Map\n            \n            \n                This map is for quick reference purposes only and may not be to scale.

    "wikipedia_text": "Powis House was an 18th-century mansion in London, England. It stood on the northern side of Great Ormond Street, not far from Queen Square.\nThe first version of Powis House was built in the 1690s for William Herbert, 2nd Marquess of Powis, member of the Herbert family. No drawings of this version survive. At some point it was let for use as the French embassy, and on 26 January 1713 it burned to the ground, while the Ambassador, the Duc d'Aumont, was entertaining. Jonathan Swift attributed this event to \"the carelessness of the rascally French servants\". A replacement house was soon built. It had three main storeys above an arched basement and was 104 feet (32 metres) wide. The subtle but lively façade featured Corinthian pilasters and a phoenix above the front door. The architect is unknown, but may have been French. The staircase walls were painted by the Venetian painter of the rococo, Giacomo Amiconi.\nPhilip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke leased the house in the mid 18th century and from 1764 to 1783 it was the Spanish embassy. However, the locality was rapidly falling from favour with the aristocracy, making the demise of the house more or less inevitable, and by the end of the 18th century it had been demolished. There is now a small access street to Great Ormond Street Hospital called Powis Place.\n\n\n== References ==\nLondon's Mansions by David Pearce, (1986) ISBN 0-7134-8702-X\n\n\n== See also ==\nNewcastle House - another London mansion, which was also briefly known as Powis House before assuming its final name."

    Reasons for Designation\n    \n    \n        The Grand Connaught Rooms, Nos. 61-63 Great Queen Street, is designated at Grade II* for the following principal reasons:  \n*  \tArchitectural: for the façade of the former Freemasons' Tavern, a good example of a mid-C19 Italianate commercial frontage, and for the surviving section of Cockerell's elaborate Freemasons' Hall with figures by a notable sculptor.\n*\tInteriors: a unique ensemble of spaces, comprising elements of the 1774 Tavern, a series of ornate rooms dating from 1863-64 and 1905-10, most notably the Great Hall, and a

by Frederick Pepys Cockerell, retaining structure from the preceding Freemasons' Tavern of 1774.  Figure sculpture by William Grinsell Nicholl.  Enlarged and remodelled 1905-10 as the Connaught Rooms, a suite of dining, meeting and entertainment rooms, under Alexander Brown and Ernest Barrow, detailed design by Crickmay & Sons.  Extended 1933-36 to the design of HV Ashley and Winton Newman.  Extension to east (formerly Nos. 64 and 65), built 1956-57, is not of special interest.EXTERIOR: The 1863-64 façade of the former Freemasons' Tavern (Nos. 62-63): brick with Portland stone dressings (now painted). Two main storeys plus basement and attic storey; five bays.  Recessed end bays with an entrance to the west and a window in the east, each with a swan-neck-pediment and balustraded balconet above.  The three central ground-floor windows were altered in 1905-10 to form the main entrance to the Connaught Rooms. Central first-floor windows have stone architraves, central window pedimented.  Second-floor bays are pilastered; each has an oval oeil-de-boeuf above the window.  Parapet has piers to each bay and a cast-iron balustrade. Entrance canopy added 1933, much altered.  To the west is the surviving three-bay section of Cockerell's Portland stone Freemasons' Hall facade (No. 61) plus small section of the central pedimented bay.  Two storeys above basement, plus main attic storey and mansard attic above.  Ground and first floors are framed by rusticated pilasters with Composite capitals.  First floor has French windows with cast-iron balconets, the bays separated by composite columns in antis.  Above the windows is a frieze carved with three faces, one between each column, representing the sun, moon and stars.  Above the dentilled cornice, the attic storey has three windows behind a balustrade, framed by niches containing female statues representing Wisdom and Fidelity.  A deep bracketed cornice supports a scrolled parapet; to the right, a section of the pediment survives.  Cast-iron area railings with ball finials.  Rear elevation comprises (east-west) post-war extension to Great Hall annexe (not of special interest); rear of Great Hall in red brick with Portland stone dressings with blocked Serlian window, and rear of 1933 extension faced in red brick with stone dressings.INTERIOR:  The layout is complex, but room alignment essentially conforms to the former plots of Nos. 61-61, and is described accordingly: 1.   Nos. 62-63 (behind 1863-64 Tavern facade): comprises a large entrance hall and stair from ground to first floor, the Drawing Room at first, the Crown and Coronet Rooms at second, and Grand Hall at the rear accessed at first-floor level via a lobby.  Entrance hall and stair in opulent Edwardian Baroque manner with elaborate plaster enrichment.  Black-and-white chequered marble floor and paired columns on the left (east) side.  Imperial stair with a heavy marble balustrade and vase balusters.  First-floor landing has elaborate coved ceiling, swagged decoration above fielded panels on west wall and windows (now doors) on east wall. At the north end a doorway with an enriched architrave leads through to the Drawing Room, dating from 1863-64, embellished 1905-10 when it was combined with an ante-room on the south side.   Enriched coffered ceiling with central square compartment carried on four columns.  To south of landing, an arch flanked by paired columns leads to a lobby through to the Grand Hall.  No interior views of Cockerell's original hall are known to exist, but embellishments were clearly made in 1905-10 when it was extended.  The hall is of ten pilastered bays, originally six, with an elaborate cornice and barrel-vaulted ceiling with roundels inset with cast-iron decorative ventilation grilles.  Large Serlian window to south end, now blocked.  Balcony to north end, added in 1905-10, with bronze balustrade; above is a small upper gallery beneath a segmental swagged pediment supported on caryatids. East wall was removed when the annex was created; this area is decorated in a similar manner, while the west wall had doors inserted in each bay.  The Crown Room (second floor) is mainly by Cockerell, and has an elaborate deep coved ceiling with lattice plasterwork and a lantern dome, carried on paired Corinthian columns and pilasters; a door with an elaborate architrave leads through to the Coronet Room to the rear, which also has an enriched coved ceiling.  2.   No. 61: incorporating the remodelled 1788 Tavern behind the retained portion of Cockerell's Freemasons' Hall façade.  Elements of C18 plan and structure survive, comprising a front room, a square-plan, open-well stair (the west stair) behind with a small room to the east, and larger room to the rear alongside lightwell.  At ground floor a segmental barrel-vaulted lobby of 1905-10 leads from the entrance hall to the Lounge Bar, which has a dentilled cornice, again Edwardian.  To the rear is the Champagne Bar created in 1963 in a neo-Edwardian style, timber panelled with alcoves.  West stair has moulded inner string.  Doorways leading off the stair at first and second-floor levels have panelled linings, bolection-moulded architraves and splayed plinth blocks, probably dating from 1788.  A lift shaft has been inserted into the well, and the balustrade removed.  Rooms at upper levels refurbished 1933-36 and later.  The Ampthill Room (third floor), remodelled 1905-10, has barrel-vaulted ceiling with enriched plaster ribs.  3.   1933-36 five-storey block to the rear of No. 61: at ground floor is a cloakroom with some original fittings.  Above is a series of large and small rooms with interconnecting corridors and lobbies, accessed at first floor via a lobby aligned with the Grand Hall lobby.  The large open-well stair in cast stone has a geometrical-pattern bronze balustrade; the landings interconnect on the west side with the Freemasons' Hall.  Many rooms and lobby areas retain original fittings and decorative features incorporating Masonic symbols, including coffered ceilings, plasterwork with stylised classical and Art Deco motifs, steel-frame windows with stained glass, secondary stairs, doors and architraves, and a few mirrors.  Doors to several rooms have raised rhomboid and diamond panels, and handles or knobs decorated with six-pointed stars; there is a large uplighter on the landing with brass candelbra.  The Balmoral and Devon Rooms are panelled, the latter with decorative inlay.  The Ulster Room is decorated in an in Egyptian Art Deco manner.Post-war additions, including extension to Grand Hall annexe, are not of special interest.  Not all rooms were inspected.HISTORY: The evolution of the Grand Connaught Rooms is complex, dating from 1774 when the street's association with freemasonry began.  Regularly organised freemasonry in England is considered to have begun on 24 June 1717 when four lodges met at the Goose and Gridiron alehouse in St Paul's Churchyard, Covent Garden, to found the Grand Lodge of England (GLE), the world's first grand masonic lodge. This was an intinerant body meeting at inns, taverns and livery halls, but by 1768 there were almost 400 masonic lodges nationally, all of whose masters were eligible to attend GLE meetings, and funds were raised to build a new hall.  In 1774, the GLE acquired No. 61 Great Queen Street, a five-bay house of 1637, to the rear of which had been added a second dwelling.  The GLE occupied the rear building while the front house was leased to Luke Reilly, who opened it as the Freemasons' Tavern.  The Tavern was an important asset to the GLE both as a source of income and for the servicing of masonic meetings.  In 1775-76 the GLE built a hall on the land at the rear of No. 61, to the design of Thomas Sandby, Grand Architect to the GLE.  Believed to be the first purpose-built masonic hall in England, it was entered at first-floor level, and had an elaborate deep coved ceiling embellished with Masonic symbols, lit by clerestorey windows. The hall was rented out for non-masonic events such as concerts and fundraising dinners.  The Anti-Slavery Society was founded there in 1807, and in 1839 Daniel O'Connell addressed a meeting in support of Catholic Emancipation.  In 1787 the GLE acquired Reilly's lease and rebuilt the Tavern in 1788-89, to the design of William Tyler.  This four-storey building housed the Freemasons' Tavern on the ground floor and masonic rooms above.  In 1790, the GLE purchased the lease of No. 62, the adjacent house to the east, as an annex. The GLE merged with its rival, the Antient Grand Lodge (founded 1751), as the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE) in 1813, the year in which (Sir) John Soane became a freemason and Grand Superintendent of Works to the UGLE.  Soane was duly engaged to design a second hall, exclusively for masonic use, which was built on the rear gardens of the adjacent houses to the east, Nos. 62-63, whose freeholds were acquired in 1815 by John Cuff, then leaseholder of the Tavern (Cuff sold the freeholds to the UGLE in 1838).  Soane's hall, named the Temple, was one of his most complex and refined late interiors, lit by clerestorey windows with a central pendant dome.  It was enlarged by Philip Hardwick in 1838, but was apparently never held in great regard.  The Tavern was a popular meeting place: in 1807 the Geological Society was founded there, and in 1863 the Football Association of England.  In 1867 a banquet was held there in honour of Charles Dickens prior to his departure on a reading tour of  the USA.Between 1848-58 the UGLE acquired Nos. 59-60 to the west and Nos. 64-65 to the east.  The latter were leased separately as a hotel and from 1899-1939 to the Grand Lodge of the Mark Master Masons.  In 1864-5 a new Tavern and Freemasons' Hall were built on the site of Nos. 59-63, retaining Sandby's hall, to the design of FP Cockerell (1833-78), son of the architect CR Cockerell. The Tavern and UGLE premises were henceforth separated functionally, while interlinked, and visually by the design of their façades.  The Freemasons' Hall to the west, corresponding with the plots of Nos. 59-61, had an imposing classical façade of three storeys and nine bays, with statues in niches symbolising the four Masonic virtues: Wisdom, Fidelity, Charity and Unity, by William Grinsell Nicholl (1796-1871).  The Tavern façade to the east, corresponding with the plots of Nos. 62-63, was designed in a more reticent classical manner.  Behind these two discrete façades however the demarcation lines were less clear since No. 61 (behind the eastern portion of the Freemasons' Hall façade), remained part of the Tavern, hence the survival of this part of the building.  This arrangement arose from Cockerell's desire to give the hall a longer street elevation than the Tavern.  Moreover, a substantial part of the C18 fabric of No. 61 was retained behind the new façade, and still survives in altered form.  By the mid C19, the catering sector was becoming increasingly commercialised: dining halls, restaurants and refreshment rooms, often connected to hotels and railway stations, proliferated, while continental chefs introduced more elaborate cusine.  The Tavern improvements  were clearly aimed at exploiting this niche in the market, and in 1864 a new company was formed to run the Tavern, which in the 1870s employed the former royal chef Francatelli as manager.  The Tavern had a morning room and dining rooms; at first floor a domed and columned vestibule and grand stair, leading through to the Great Hall, which was placed to the east of Sandby's hall (the latter, on the demise of Soane's building, was renamed the Temple).  The Freemasons' Hall comprised a series of offices, a grand stair, and lodge and ante rooms, plus Sandby's Temple at the rear of the Tavern.  In 1880 the UGLE acquired Nos. 57-58, which were rebuilt in 1899 as a library and museum, replicating Cockerell's Tavern façade.The next major phase was from 1905-10, following the expiry of the Tavern's lease and acquisition of property in Wild Court and Middle Court to the rear.  Architects Alexander Brown (Grand Superintendent of Works to the UGLE) and Ernest Barrow were appointed to extend and remodel the Tavern, to be named thereafter the 'Connaught Rooms' in honour of the Grand Master, the Duke of Connaught.  The detailed design however appears to have been by Crickmay & Sons.  A large entrance hall was created and the grand stair rebuilt.  The Great Hall was lengthened and given an annex on the east side (behind Nos. 64-65); it now seated 800 and was hailed as the largest of its kind in London.  The building offered a suite of newly refurbished rooms for hire for social and corporate events, and a grill room, buffet, American bar and smoking room at basement level. In 1915, Nos. 55-56, the last surviving C17 house in Great Queen Street, was demolished to make way for an extension to the Freemasons' Hall, but this plan was superseded by a scheme for a new building to commemorate the freemasons killed in World War I.  Cockerell's Freemasons' Hall was demolished (with the exception of the east portion of the façade) and the new Masonic Hall was completed in 1933 to the design of Ashley & Newman.  The Connaught Rooms were further aggrandised in 1933-36 when Sandby's Temple was deemed unstable and demolished to make way for a five-storey extension, designed by Ashley & Newman.  The last phase of expansion was in 1956-57 when Nos. 64-65 were rebuilt to the design of Ashley & Newman.SOURCES: The Builder, 18 August 1866, 611-613\nSurvey of London, Vol 5: St Giles in the Fields, pt II (1914), \nThe Architecture and History of the Grand Connaught Rooms, English Heritage unpublished report (2010) REASON FOR DESIGNATION: The Grand Connaught Rooms, Nos. 61-63 Great Queen Street, is designated at Grade II* for the following principal reasons:  \n*  \tArchitectural: for the façade of the former Freemasons' Tavern, a good example of a mid-C19 classical commercial frontage, and for the surviving section of Cockerell's elaborate Freemasons' Hall with figures by a notable sculptor.\n*\tInteriors: a unique ensemble of spaces, comprising elements of the 1774 Tavern, a series of ornate rooms dating from 1863-64 and 1905-10, most notably the Great Hall, and a virtually complete suite of 1933-36 interiors.\n*\tHistoric: the successor of the original Freemasons' Tavern, the site of Britain's first Grand Lodge, and for the numerous events that took place there including the founding of the the Anti-Slavery Society and the Football Association.\n*\tGroup value: with the adjoining Masonic Hall, listed Grade II*.\n\n        \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n    \n        Legacy\n    \n    \n        The contents of this record have been generated from a legacy data system.\n    \n    \n        \n            Legacy System number:\n            \n                507823\n            \n        \n        \n            Legacy System:\n            \n                LBS\n            \n        \n    \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n\n\n\n                    \n                        \n\n\n    \n        Legal\n    \n\n\n    \n        This building is listed under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as amended for its special architectural or historic interest.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n\n            \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n            \n                Map\n            \n            \n                This map is for quick reference purposes only and may not be to scale.

The sculpture, its plinth, and the applied raised lettering beneath it, form part of the listing.Pursuant to s.1 (5A) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (‘the Act’) it is declared that the John Lewis store, the building to which the sculpture, plinth and lettering is applied, is not of special architectural or historic interest.\n    \n\n                    \n\n\n    \n        Reasons for Designation\n    \n    \n        Winged Figure, 1963, by Dame Barbara Hepworth, (including the plinth and applied lettering beneath) is listed at Grade II* for the following principal reasons: \n*          Artistic interest: as a sculpture of high artistic and aesthetic quality, possessing a universal beauty in its sense of fluid movement and dynamic spatial expression; \n*          Historic interest: as a piece commissioned by a commercial client from an internationally renowned artist, and as an example of her mature work situated in the urban environment for which it was designed;\n*          Urban context: the piece has become an Oxford Street landmark, inextricably associated with the John Lewis store; it demonstrates the potential for art to enhance the built environment and become ingrained into a collective sense of place.\n\n    \n\n                    \n\n\n        \n            History\n        \n        \n            The period after 1945 saw a shift from commemorative sculpture and architectural enrichment to the idea of public sculpture as a primarily aesthetic contribution to the public realm. Sculpture was commissioned for new housing, schools, universities and civic set pieces, with the counties of Hertfordshire, London and Leicestershire leading the way in public patronage. Thus public sculpture could be an emblem of civic renewal and social progress. By the late C20 however, patronage was more diverse and included corporate commissions and Arts Council-funded community art. The ideology of enhancing the public realm through art continued, but with divergent means and motivation.Visual languages ranged from the abstraction of Victor Pasmore and Phillip King to the figurative approach of Elisabeth Frink and Peter Laszlo Peri, via those such as Lynn Chadwick and Barbara Hepworth who bridged the abstract/representational divide. The post-war decades are characterised by the exploitation of new – often industrial – materials and techniques including new welding and casting techniques, plastics and concrete, while kinetic sculpture and ‘ready mades’ (using found objects) demonstrate an interest in composite forms.(Dame) Barbara Hepworth’s Winged Figure was commissioned for the newly completed rebuilding of John Lewis’ flagship Oxford Street store, which was the work of the practice Slater, Moberly & Uren. The idea of adorning the building with sculpture had been advocated by John Spedan Lewis, son and successor of John Lewis, in 1951, but by 1960 a suitable artist had still not been found. In May 1961 Barbara Hepworth was approached after her piece ‘Meridian’, outside the State House, Holborn, London, caught the eye of Bernard Miller, who by this time had taken over from Spedan Lewis. She was asked for a piece which expressed the idea of common ownership and interest in a partnership of thousands of workers. In October that year she presented a maquette of her proposal, a piece entitled ‘Three Forms in Echelon’. This consisted of three irregularly shaped forms, floating above one another; each with a central hole and connected to its neighbour by a series of radiating wire strings. The proposal was not well received by Miller, to Hepworth’s chagrin, and despite her stout defence of the piece Miller remained unconvinced. A maquette of the piece is now held at The Hepworth Wakefield art gallery. Hepworth and Miller agreed instead that she should fulfil an ambition to realise a version of one of her existing sculptures at a larger scale, and Winged Figure I, 1957, was the piece agreed upon (the prototype is also held at The Hepworth Wakefield). Hepworth and Miller agreed that the piece should be cast in aluminium, rather than bronze, because of its comparative lightness. Winged Figure was cast at the Morris Singer foundry, Walthamstow, London in autumn 1962, and installed on the John Lewis store on 21 April 1963.Hepworth summarised her ambitions for the project: ‘I think one of our universal dreams is to move in air and water without the resistance of our human legs, I wanted to evoke this sensation of freedom. If the Winged Figure in Oxford Street gives people a sense of being air-bourne in rain and sunlight and nightlight I will be very happy. It is a project I have long wished to fulfil and this site with its wonderful oblique wall was quite perfect.’\n \nDame Barbara Hepworth (1903-75) was born in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. She studied first at Leeds School of Art, and then the Royal College of Art, London subsequently winning a scholarship which took her to Italy where, with class mate and soon-to-be first husband John Skeaping, she learned to carve stone. On their return to London, along with Richard Bedford and Henry Moore, they became leading figures of the ‘new movement’ associated with direct carving. Hepworth’s forms during the 1930s became increasingly abstracted, and this marked the direction of travel for the rest of her career. Hepworth and her second husband, the artist Ben Nicholson, established links with the continental avant-garde, visiting the Paris studios of figures such as Jean Arp, Constantin Brâncusi and Pablo Picasso. They were instrumental in a fertile period of British Constructivism, enhanced by artist refugees fleeing totalitarian Europe. In 1939 they moved to St Ives, Cornwall, where Hepworth remained for the rest of her life. Hepworth became the centre of the modernist artistic community in St Ives during its period of post-war international prominence. Her international standing was confirmed in the late 1950s and 1960s; she was awarded the Grand Prix of the 1959 Bienal de São Paulo, and was made a Dame of the British Empire for her achievement as a sculptor in 1965. Her most prestigious commission was Single Form, erected in 1964 outside the United Nations building in New York as a memorial to the Secretary-General, Dag Hammarskjöld.Following her death her studio became the Barbara Hepworth Museum, coming under the aegis of the Tate in 1980. Her archive is deposited with the Tate Gallery, while The Hepworth Wakefield holds a significant record of her work. She was the subject of a major retrospective exhibition at the Tate Britain in 2015.\n\n        \n        \n            Details\n        \n        \n            Winged Figure by (Dame) Barbara Hepworth, erected 1963. The work was founded by Morris Singer, Walthamstow, and is mounted on the east elevation of the John Lewis Oxford Street store (which is not listed), facing onto the south end of Holles Street.The materials are aluminium alloy with stainless steel rods.Winged Figure is a concave form of two wing-like projections of unequal height, joined in the middle. The wings curve outwards away from the building on the vertical axis, and curve in towards each other at the top and bottom. Both wings are pierced with an irregularly-shaped hole. Fine steel rods connect the wings diagonally at opposing points along their outer edge, an arrangement which creates a sense of twisting movement and flow.The back of the piece is fixed to the wall, but it also stands on a small inverted L-shaped bracket.

    "wikipedia_text": "Winged Figure (BH 315) is a 1963 sculpture by British artist Barbara Hepworth.  One of Hepworth's best known works, it has been displayed in London since April 1963, on Holles Street near the junction with Oxford Street, mounted on the south-east side of the John Lewis department store.  It is estimated that the sculpture is seen by approximately 200 million people each year.\nIt was granted a Grade II* listing in January 2016.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe new John Lewis store on Oxford Street replaced earlier war-damaged premises.  The building was designed by architects Slater & Uren in 1956 and reopened in 1961.\nJohn Lewis originally approached Jacob Epstein to create a sculpture to decorate the plain Portland stone side wall of the new store, but he declined as he was engaged on other commissions.  Instead, in May 1961, John Lewis asked six other artists to propose designs.  In addition to Hepworth – whose breakthrough public sculpture, Meridian, had recently been installed outside State House on Holborn – the others were Ralph Brown, Geoffrey Clarke, Tony Hollaway, Stefan Knapp, William Mitchell and Hans Tisdall.  None of their initial designs was accepted.\nHepworth had been asked to express \"the idea of common ownership and common interests in a partnership of thousands of workers\" and in October 1961 Hepworth had proposed a different design, Three Forms in Echelon, but John Lewis rejected it.  One of ten bronze maquettes of Three Forms in Echelon (BH 306) cast in 1965 (nine numbered casts plus one for the artist) is now held by the Tate Gallery.\nHer second proposal, based on an enlargement of her 1957 sculpture Winged Figure I (BH 228), was accepted. Related sculptures by Hepworth, such as Stringed Figure (Curlew) and Orpheus, were also made in sheet metal with rods.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\nThe work stands 5.8 metres (19 ft) high, resembling a boat's hull, with two wide asymmetric wings like blades rising from a small plinth, curving towards each other and linked to each other by a series of radial rods like strings that almost cross at a single point in the middle of the sculpture.\nWinged Figure was the first sculpture Hepworth created in her Palais de Danse studio. She made a prototype in 1962 in wood and then aluminium in St Ives, constructed from lengths of aluminium covered with aluminium sheets and linked by ten aluminium rods.  The surface of the prototype was then textured with Isopon, a polyester resin filler.  The aluminium prototype – the largest prototype by Hepworth still in existence – is now held by the Hepworth Museum in Wakefield, Yorkshire.\nThe main body of the final work was cast in aluminium by the founders Morris Singer in Walthamstow, with the rods replaced by stainless steel.  It was installed on the John Lewis building on Sunday, 21 April 1963, on a plinth 13 feet (4.0 m) above the pavement.  It was refurbished for its 50th anniversary in 2013.\nA brass maquette for Winged Figure (BH 227) made in 1957 was sold at Christie's in November 2012 for $422,500.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nThe Hepworth family gift, Tate etc., 1 December 2011\nCatalogue entry for Maquette, Three Forms in Echelon, Tate Gallery\nBarbara Hepworth commissions, barbarahepworth.org.uk\nArtwork of the month: Winged Figure, Hepworth Wakefield\nJohn Lewis Oxford Street and The Hepworth Wakefield celebrate 50 years of Winged Figure, Hepworth Wakefield\nThe Language of Displayed Art, Michael O'Toole, p. 59–60\nMaquette for Winged Figure, Christies, 8 November 2012\nMaquette for Winged Figure, British Council art collection\nHistoric England. \"Winged Figure (1430994)\".

Some C18, C19 and C20 alterations. To the rear is a C19 outbuilding, originally a workshop.\n    \n\n                    \n\n\n    \n        Reasons for Designation\n    \n    \n        No 7 Denmark Street, a terraced house of c1690, with a former workshop to the rear, is listed at Grade II* for the following principal reasons:\n*  Architectural interest: the building is a rare, well-preserved, example of its type, reflecting the architectural fashions of the late C17, and preceding the patterns of urban terraced housing which followed in subsequent centuries;\n*  Level of survival: the building retains its historic floor-plan and much of its original exterior and interior character, with a hierarchy of original panelling, plasterwork and joinery;\n*  Historic interest: forming part of an early domestic terrace, with a later workshop to the rear, the building demonstrates evolving patterns of occupation in this central London location.\n\n    \n\n                    \n\n\n        \n            History\n        \n        \n            No 7 Denmark Street is one of eight surviving late-C17 terraced houses built as part of the development of Denmark Street between 1686 and 1691.Situated in the Parish of St Giles, the name of Denmark Street commemorates the marriage in 1683 of Princess, later Queen, Anne, younger daughter of James, Duke of York, to Prince George of Denmark. The street is aligned from east to west from the corner of the churchyard of St Giles-in-the-Fields to Charing Cross Road, and runs across the site of the former St Giles Hospital.The street was developed by Samuel Fortrey and Jaques Wiseman. In 1686 Fortrey and Wiseman presented a petition to the Westminster Commissioners of Sewers, asking for permission to rebuild the sewer in Hog Lane (the line of the present Charing Cross Road) and lead a sewer from their new houses to it. The petition stated that they were to build about twenty houses in all, indicating the development of the whole street. Fortrey died in 1689, but a further petition to the commissioners by his brother and administrator, William Fortrey, in January 1691 shows that all the houses in Denmark Street were by then completed. Fortrey and Wiseman were not craftsmen themselves, so it is possible the individual freeholds were sold to several different builders who were responsible for the actual construction of the houses.Built for the middle classes, it is not clear how long the houses maintained this status. The St Giles Rookery - a notorious slum - blighted parts of the parish during the C18 and C19, and certainly by the C19 the houses began to shift towards commercial uses, with metal-working businesses becoming a particular feature of the street in the later part of the century. Ground floors became shops, while upper floors were used as workshops or living accommodation. A number of C19 outbuildings which survive to the rear of the frontage buildings are associated with this changing character.Commercial uses continued into the C20, but the second half of the century marked a particularly notable chapter in the street's history, becoming the centre of London’s, and by extension, Britain’s, music industry, gaining it the moniker ‘Tin Pan Alley’. Music publishers and sellers of sheet music appeared on the street prior to the Second World War, and it was on Denmark Street that 'Melody Maker', one of the earliest weekly music newspapers, was founded in 1926. But it was during the post-Second World War period that the street had its heyday at the heart of a thriving industry; post-war photographs and films indicate virtually every building and shop in the street had a function connected to music. Denmark Street was known for its recording studios and music shops (the Rolling Stones recorded their first album at Regent Sound Studios at No 4) but perhaps the most significant business was that of music publishing, a field dominated in particular by very successful Jewish entrepreneurs. Numerous music publishing offices acted as the headquarters for aspiring songwriters to publish and place their songs. Among Britain’s internationally significant writers with a particularly strong connection to Denmark Street are David Bowie, Elton John, Ray Davies, and the Sex Pistols, artists who have all had a considerable influence on the course of Britain’s post-war popular culture as well as its music.Post Office directories of the 1950s and 1960s show a variety of tenants at No 7, including Box and Cox music publishers, whose most famous hit was 'I've got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts', the Tin Pan Alley Club, and RaCity Sales Ltd - the offices of Radio City pirate radio station, based off the Kent coast. Also listed at No 7 in 1951 is the Humphrey Lyttelton band; Lyttelton formed his first band in 1948 and went on to become a major figure in British jazz.ADDITIONAL NOTES ON THE MUSIC INDUSTRY AND DENMARK STREET\nDavid Bowie: a well-documented frequent visitor to Denmark Street in the early part of his career, to an extent where he is rumoured to have camped in a second hand ambulance van in the street. The van belonged to a band called The Lower Third with whom Bowie (then under his real name David Jones) joined forces with in 1965. Within weeks of this meeting David Jones also changed his name, to David Bowie.Elton John: worked at a music publishers at No 20. He wrote “Your Song” his first hit single, in Denmark Street itself.The Kinks: were signed to a Denmark Street music publisher known as Eddie Kassner, with whom Ray Davies spectacularly fell out over the matter of royalties. This story is partly documented in the classic Kinks song “Denmark Street” from their album about the British music industry “Lola vs Powerman and The Moneygoround Part One”. The song “Denmark Street” forms part of the current West End hit musical “Sunny Afternoon”. The Kinks articulate and genre-defining hit singles hugely influenced Britpop and sold in very large quantities.The Sex Pistols: the group both lived in and rehearsed to the rear of No. 6 during their early, formative years when they single-handedly defined what became known as Punk Rock, a movement that caught the nation’s undivided attention, and was to prove highly influential from 1976 onwards.\n\n        \n        \n            Details\n        \n        \n            MATERIALS: No 7 is of red brick construction with stucco to the ground floor. Windows and doors are timber.\nPLAN: it is a three-bay, three-storey terraced house with attic and basement. The pitched roofs, with dormer windows to the front, are masked by a later brick parapet. The original late-C17 floor plan survives intact above the ground floor. This comprises a front and back room on each floor, heated by side-wall stacks (the fireplaces in the back rooms being set across the back corner). A dog-leg stair is set against the opposing side wall. There is a closet wing to the rear of the building and several single-storey accretions of probable C20 date.EXTERIOR: the upper two storeys have ranges of three six-over-six pane sash windows with exposed sash boxes (two of the windows have lost most of their glazing bars). The windows have splayed flat brick arches with painted central keystones; there is a string course above the first-floor windows. Unlike elsewhere on the street where the ground floor arrangement of a door and two windows has been replaced with a shopfront, at No 7, and its neighbour No 6, the original arrangement survives, albeit with the brickwork rendered and the window openings extended downwards, in the case of No 7, to form half-glazed pairs of French windows. The original door-case survives, with carved console brackets supporting a projecting pediment; above the six-panel door there is a large rectangular fanlight.INTERIOR: the ground floor rooms have been opened up to one another, and original features have been lost. Elsewhere in the building however, including the ground floor hall, there is a substantially complete late C17 interior, with some C18, and C19, alterations. Box cornices survive widely and wall panelling is reflective of the house's relative hierarchy; from bolection moulded panelling in some of the principal rooms, to simple timber boarding in the basement and attic. The first floor room to the front has a particularly complete panelled interior with heavy bolection mouldings. Some panelling also survives in the closet wing. The basement stair has a simple square newel and stick balusters, but from the ground floor up the stair has a moulded closed string with barley-twist balusters, and with the exception of some missing balusters, survives throughout the building. Principal rooms have panelled window-shutters, and fireplaces of various dates survive above ground floor; several appearing to have remnants of their original timber surrounds.OUTBUILDING: the outbuilding to the rear of No 7 faces onto a small courtyard, where there are several adhoc extensions. The outbuilding is of brick construction, single storey, with part-pitched, part-flat roof. The front wall is partially built-against. Internally the walls are bare brick, with a chimney stack against the back wall. A large pitched skylight is indicative of its workshop use.\n\n        \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n                    Sources\n                \n                \n                    None.\n                \n\n\n\n                    \n                        \n\n\n    \n        Legal\n    \n\n\n    \n        This building is listed under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as amended for its special architectural or historic interest.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n\n            \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n            \n                Map\n            \n            \n                This map is for quick reference purposes only and may not be to scale.
