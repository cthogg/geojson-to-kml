        Summary
    
    
A Commissioners’ church constructed 1823-1825 to designs by Sir John Soane, and restored following Second World War bomb damage 1952-1955 by Thomas Ford.    

                    


    
        Reasons for Designation
    
    
        The Church of St Peter, constructed 1823-1825 to the design of Sir John Soane, is listed at Grade I for the following principal reasons:Architectural interest:
*    as a well-preserved example of a church by Sir John Soane, one of Britain's most distinguished architects, and designed in his highly individualistic classical style;
*    for its distinctive composition and form, including characteristically Soanean features such as the complex domed tower and the grand Ionic portico;
*    for the restrained elegance of its interior, which is characteristic of Soane's mastery of space and light;
*    for the quality of its fixtures and fittings, particularly the C19 reredos and font, which are complemented by the C20 stained glass at the east end;
*    for its visual presence as a major urban landmark in Walworth.Historic interest:
*    as one of three churches designed by Sir John Soane following the Church Building Act 1818;
*    for the importance of the church in the C19 and C20 history of Walworth.Group value:
*    with the Gates, Gate Piers and Boundary Railings and Walls to the Church of St Peter (NHLE: 1385663; Grade II), 28-52 Liverpool Grove (NHLE: 1385660; Grade II) and 54, 56 and 58 Liverpool Grove (NHLE: 1385661; Grade II).
    

                    


        
            History
        
        
            In the first two decades of the C19 the population of Newington grew rapidly from 14,847 to 44,526. Non-conformists were adequately catered for in the London Road Chapel and later in the new church in St George’s Road, but the parish church of St Mary Newington could only accommodate just over 1000 people. Its burial ground was almost full and there was no other provision by the established church for the expanding population in the parish. In 1820 a local Act was passed authorising the erection of two new churches in the area: St Peter’s and Trinity. A site was selected on the east side of Walworth Road (then Turnpike Road) where a house with gardens and orchards behind were bought from the Clutton family for £2,197. The site was cleared for the new church and its approaches. The freehold interest was presented by the Dean and Chapter of Canterbury. The first three architects approached to build St Peter’s - Christopher Edmonds, Thomas Ruck, and Simeon Thomas Bull - all had their designs rejected by the Church Building Commissioners, who then commissioned John (later Sir John) Soane on 26 August 1822. Sir John Soane (1753-1837) is one of British architectural history’s most distinguished architects, whose works include the Bank of England (NHLE: 1079134; Grade I), the Dulwich Picture Gallery (NHLE: 1385543; Grade II*) and numerous country houses. His fame in the late Georgian period as a highly individualistic classical architect has continued into the early C21 in which Soane’s work has been interpreted as proto-modernist. Soane was an active Freemason from 1813 and seems not to have been particularly devoted to the Anglican Church of his time, but he ultimately received commissions for three new churches under the Church Building Act 1818. St Peter’s was the second of these commissions and the first to be completed in 1825. The other two were the Church of Holy Trinity, Marylebone, constructed 1825-1827 (NHLE: 1267658; Grade I) and the Church of St John on Bethnal Green, constructed 1826-1828 (NHLE: 1065245; Grade I).Soane began to produce drawings for St Peter’s in September 1822. Early design drawings suggest that Soane was using his designs for Holy Trinity, Marylebone (his first church commission) as the basis for St Peter’s. He originally conceived the church with a high, hipped roof over the nave to create a clerestory level, and with windows of equal height across the side elevations. Decoration would largely follow the Classical orders alongside Soanean details such as pinecone finials. Soane costed his original scheme at £17,800. The Commissioners had stipulated that the new church should accommodate 2000 people and that the cost was not to exceed £16,000. Although he proposed saving some money through tendering for many small contractors, Soane was unhappy at also having to compromise on materials to reduce costs. Yellow stock brick was substituted for the original white, the roof was covered with lead instead of slate, and much of the stonework ultimately used more economical Bath stone in place of Soane’s preferred Portland stone. In addition to structural changes and reducing the size of the vault, Soane’s revised designs of 1823 also cut back on the amount of original detailing. This can be seen in the truncated key-pattern frieze which wraps around from the front and rear elevations and extends just across the outer bays instead of continuing across the whole of the side elevations, and internally columns were left unfluted and the nave ceiling lowered to match that of the chancel. Despite Soane’s paring back of his original design, the final cost of the church was approximately £18,952. Ironically, during construction in 1823, Bath stone fell into short supply so the stone mason, William Chadwick provided some quantity of Portland stone gratis, allowing the front Ionic columns and parts of the tower to be constructed from this more durable stone.The foundation stone was laid on 2 June 1823 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, who returned to consecrate the completed church on 28 February 1825. Although Soane designed some of the original fittings, others are reported to have been designed by N Cachemaille Day, brought later from his Church of All Saints, Surrey Square. In 1886 the east end of the church was reordered by E Christian and a new altar table and choir stalls were installed.The churchyard was made into a public garden in 1895 by the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association at the cost of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, an event commemorated by an inscription on a water fountain that stands at the east end of the churchyard. Instrumental in this transformation was the Reverend John William Horsley (1845-1921), rector of St Peter's from 1894 to 1904. A social reformer, Horsley was also chairman of the borough of Southwark's public health committee and of its largest workhouse. He went on to become an honorary canon of both Rochester and Southwark and, in 1909, mayor of Southwark. A keen botanist and zoologist, Horsley organised annual guided trips for parishioners to Meiringen in Switzerland, to enjoy apline landscapes, flora and fauna. He believed the most effective approach to diminishing crime was by improving the welfare of children, and during his tenure at St Peter's he cleared the church crypt of coffins and transformed it into a playground for the poor children of Walworth.In 1919 cracks appeared in the church walls caused by rotten timber in the foundations, which were then replaced with concrete. Then in 1926 the east wall of the sanctuary was underpinned, and architect A E Henderson was commissioned to carry out a complete repainting and cleaning of the church.During both World Wars the church was used as an air raid shelter. Revd John Gabriel Markham, rector to St Peter's from 1938 to 1944, converted the church crypt to accommodate 230 people early in 1939. Markham also served as an air raid warden throughout the war. By the summer of 1940 between 600 and 900 people were sheltering there every night. In the early hours of 29 October 1940 two bombs hit the church and detonated in the crypt. Markham recorded in his memoirs that over 70 people were killed and 250 seriously injured.After the war, the interior was restored as close as possible to its original state under the direction of Thomas Ford between 1953 and 1955. Alterations were limited to the repositioning of the choir stalls to widen the sanctuary and the enclosure of the two most easterly bays under the galleries to create a Lady Chapel and a choir vestry. Part of the undercroft ceiling where the bombs had penetrated was reconstructed in reinforced concrete supported on the rebuilt brick piers and arches. Clare Dawson, pupil and friend of M E Aldrich Rope, designed new stained glass to be set in the three east windows of the chancel, replacing the damaged, original glass designed by William Collins. The church was re-dedicated by the Bishop of Southwark on 11 July 1953.A new sanctuary floor and furnishings were installed in 1982. At some point in the late C20 or early C21 the original stone balustrading to the arcaded open loggia at the east elevation of the church was removed. In 2003 the undercroft was restored and refurbished to provide a community centre and café. Some of the piers reconstructed in the 1950s were removed and steel I-beams were inserted to support the ceiling, providing a new open hall space in the centre of the undercroft. The rest of the space was subdivided with lightweight partitions to create a digital arts centre, a computer suite, a crèche, a café and meeting rooms. The architect for these works was Russell Hanslip Associates, and Ellis and Moore served as structural engineers.
        
        
            Details
        
        
            A Commissioners’ church constructed 1823-1825 to designs by Sir John Soane, and restored following Second World War bomb damage 1952-1955 by Thomas Ford.MATERIALS: the church is faced with yellow stock brick with stone dressings. The columns to the front (west) elevation are of Portland stone while the bulk of the tower is of Bath stone. The nave has a pitched, slate roof and the flat gallery roofs were re-laid with copper in the 1950s restoration.PLAN: the church is rectangular on plan and is oriented on an east-west axis. The building comprises one main storey with internal galleries supported by columns approached by small staircases either side of the entrance vestibule, and a vaulted undercroft below. A tower of two stages stands over the west end.EXTERIOR: the church has exterior walls of yellow brick laid in Flemish bond rising from a stone plinth. The walls support a moulded entablature which obscures the flat gallery roofs behind. The nave roof has a shallow pitch and abuts the tower. The windows are generally tall, round-headed and latticed, set within recessed brick arches and resting on Bath stone sills. The principal (west) elevation is five bays wide, with two such windows to the outer bays. The recessed central porch has four giant Ionic columns of Portland stone supporting a Bath stone entablature with a key pattern to the architrave spanning the width of this elevation. Set within the porch between the columns are three fielded-panel doors with Portland stone architraves and entablature. The central doorway rises higher than its neighbours, meeting a moulded band of Portland stone, above which is a recessed panel of Bath stone. A flight of stone steps extends the width of the porch.The tower over the west end is of two Corinthian orders and rests on a balustraded parapet with Soanean pinecone finials to the corners. The lower stage of the tower is square. Each of its fours faces has a round-arched, louvred bell opening and a clock flanked by corner pilasters supporting the entablature above, which has a key pattern to the architrave. The upper stage is round with a cluster of eight Composite columns supporting a small dome surmounted by a weathervane. The north and south side elevations are nine bays long. The outermost bays have windows slightly shorter in height below key-pattern architraves continuing from the west and east elevations. The inner windows have moulded panels of stone beneath them, and stone transoms indicating the presence of the galleries inside. The western part of the north elevation has been excavated to provide a ramp leading to a doorway which forms the main entrance to the undercroft. This has revealed the curved brick footings to the external walls with semi-circular, flat-topped buttresses corresponding with the church windows. These brick buttresses stop short of small, square-headed windows that light the undercroft.The rear (east) elevation has projecting outer bays, each with a window slightly narrower than those to the other elevations. The key-patterned architrave wraps around from the side elevations and continues across these bays and along the returns to the deeply-recessed central three bays. Here there are three round-arched windows to the upper level, set above an arcaded open loggia of brick with a stone coping. A plain stone parapet stands above the cornice to the recessed section and there are small, arched windows to the return walls of the projecting outer bays.INTERIOR: the nave is five bays long with aisles to the north and south beneath the balustraded galleries, which rest on Doric columns and have arcading carried on octagonal columns from the first floor to the ceiling. The aisles have an unusual, shallow, convex curve to their ceilings resting on tensely curved beams with pairs of scrolled consoles to the outer walls. The eastern ends of the north and south aisles in front of the original vestries were enclosed in the 1950s to form a choir vestry and a Lady Chapel, but the galleries above continue for an extra bay above these. A third, open gallery over the west end, which is also supported on Doric columns as well as turned columns of cast iron, now houses the organ, moved from Whitelands College, Putney and installed here in 2009. This incorporates parts of the original 1824 organ by Henry Cephas Lincoln previously in the sanctuary.At the east end of the nave, the chancel is raised on a dais with the sanctuary raised on a further step up beyond. The chancel has Doric columns and pilasters to its north and south sides continuing from the aisles, with panelled doors leading to the adjacent vestries. The roof is supported by shallow segmental arches spanning the whole width of the nave, one at the west end and two at the east above the sanctuary. These have circular cut-outs to the spandrels and are internally strengthened with wrought iron, an original feature. The flat ceiling is divided into a grid of rectangular panels, some of which have moulded rosettes, and has a moulded cornice and frieze with floral motifs.Either side of the entrance vestibule there are square stair lobbies with rounded corners. At ground-floor level these lobbies are separated from the entrance vestibule by a succession of round arches. Each lobby contains a curved staircase of stone with a curved, timber handrail supported by iron stick balusters, two to a tread. Alternating pairs of these balusters contain a vertical arrangement of three cast-iron rosettes framed by a diamond pattern. Both staircases extend down to the undercroft. The north staircase always did this, but in 2003 was modified using original stones to accommodate an accessible platform lift. As part of the same phase of works, the south staircase was extended down to the undercroft using reinforced concrete. The half-landing of each staircase cuts across the arched window and is supported on a pair of thin, turned columns of cast iron. The top landings at gallery level are divided from the bell-ringers’ chamber by recesses containing pairs of Ionic columns and arched doorways leading to the chamber and galleries. The bell-ringers’ chamber has walls of rendered brick and two curved staircases leading to the upper level.The undercroft extends over the whole area of the church and has five groin-vaulted aisles formed from red and brown brick supporting the York stone church floor above. Most of the openings have round arches. The central hall space has steel I-beams inserted in 2003 to support the ceiling. The openings between the two outer aisles and the three central aisles are circular, their bases partly buried in the stone floor. Many of these circular openings had semi-glazed partitions inserted as part of the 2003 works. A similarly-shaped opening (but positioned above the floor level) at the centre of the west end of the undercroft had the bottom segment removed during the 2003 works to provide through access so that it now forms a rounded horseshoe arch. The other openings at the west end are oval-shaped with rounded heads and bases while those at the east end are segmental arches.CHURCH FURNITURE/FITTINGS: Soane’s original REREDOS stands against the east wall of the chancel. It has a pair of outer columns and pair of inner pilasters with Corinthian capitals, those to the pilasters flanking a flying dove and sunburst motif. Above this is a frieze with a key pattern in the centre and with scroll patterns either side, and a shallow, triangular pediment above. The entablature is surmounted by angels’ heads.Above the reredos are the 1950s STAINED GLASS east windows above the altar, designed by Clare Dawson, which depict from left to right: ‘Christ Announced,’ ‘Christ Born,’ and ‘Christ Declared.’ The other church windows have clear glass, but those to the staircases and vestries have a border of blue stained glass.A white marble FONT made by Garland and Fieldwick was installed in 1839 and stands at the west end of the south aisle. The font has a decorated bowl on a fluted column, and stands on a square, stone base bearing dedicatory inscriptions. There are stone MEMORIAL PLAQUES in the galleries and north-east vestry to former parishioners and their families dating from the 1830s to the 1850s.

                        Print the official list entry","St Peter's Church is an inclusive Anglican parish church in Walworth, London, in the Woolwich Episcopal Area of the Anglican Diocese of Southwark. It was built between 1823–25 and was the first church designed by Sir John Soane, in the wave of the church-building following the Napoleonic wars. It is the best preserved of Soane's churches.


== History ==
It is a Commissioners' church, receiving a grant under the Church Building Act 1818 towards the cost of its construction.  The church cost £18,592 (equivalent to £2,070,000 in 2023), and the grant from the Church Building Commission amounted to £9,354.  The church is a Grade I listed building.
It resembles two other churches by the same architect — in particular Holy Trinity Church Marylebone — in its use of London stock brickwork with stone dressings, and carries the Soane hallmark of tall arched windows set in recesses. The depressed Ionic front with cornice and balustrade over avoids the architectural problems encountered when a pediment is used.
The east end was altered in 1888, and following wartime bomb damage, major reconstruction was carried out in 1953. The interior was re-ordered in 1982. St Peter's has always maintained a catholic tradition of worship, pastoral care and mission within the parish of Walworth, St Peter.
The crypt was used as an air raid shelter during WW2: the war-time Rector estimated that between 600 and 900 people sheltered there every night. The building was badly damaged by German bombing on 29 October 1940, when more than 30 of those sheltering in the crypt were killed outright (67 eventually died) and 100 more were injured. The church was restored under the direction of Thomas F. Ford and was re-dedicated by the Bishop of Southwark on 11 July 1953.
The organ is a 1949 Harrison & Harrison instrument, installed in 2009 by Heritage Pipe Organs, which had previously been located at the chapel at the former location of Whitelands College in Putney.  The previous organ was an 1824 Henry Cephas Lincoln instrument, which survived the war-time bomb damage and was restored in 1953 by Mander Organs. The National Pipe Organ Register does not record that organ's present whereabouts.
There is a ring of eight bells, all cast in 1971 at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry.
The churchyard closed to burials in 1853. In 1895 the philanthropic Rector, Canon John Horsley (Mayor of Southwark in 1910), arranged for it to be converted to a public garden at the cost of the Goldsmiths' Company. The Metropolitan Public Gardens Association laid it out with grass and seats.


== Present day ==
Today, St Peter's thrives as an Anglican parish church serving the community of East Walworth. St Peter's also enjoys close links with St Peter's CofE Primary School and nursery, where the Rector is Chair of Governors. The joyful Parish Mass is at 10.30am on Sundays. 

In 2022, Southwark Council completed the pedestrianisation of Liverpool Grove to the front of the church.


== Restoration ==
The crypt was redeveloped by the church recently and is now home to 'InSpire', which is home to many facilities available to the local community, including a digital arts and media centre, an IT suite, crèche, conference and performance spaces, and meeting rooms. A café is open to the public in the crypt. HMDW Architects designed the project, and are the quinquennial architects for the building.
The main worship space was restored, including work to the reredos, and the installation of a new lighting scheme.

          Horace Jones, architect. For the City Corporation.           
          Low level bascule bridge with wider side spans hung from     
          curved lattice girders; central narrower opening section.    
          Steel structure with twin Gothic towers rising from 21.3m    
          (70ft) broad piers which support the bascules and house their
          counter balances.                                            
          Towers clad in rock-faced stone with ashlar dressings; high  
          pitched slate roofs behind stone battlemented parapet. High  
          level footbridges between the towers, incorporating ties     
          between the 2 suspended spans and linking whole bridge       
          together as continuous structure. Tower of 4 stages with     
          corner turrets surmounted by pinnacles. Some architectural   
          detailing added after Jones's death.                         
          Above archway, elaborate Gothic-style windows on each level  
          surmounted by dormer feature in roof; moulded string courses 
          between floors. Lower approach tower (with twin on north     
          side), in similar Gothic style and with a large elliptical   
          archway spanning the road.                                   
          Although the bascules were electrified in 1976, some of the

It crosses the River Thames close to the Tower of London and is one of five London bridges owned and maintained by the City Bridge Foundation, a charitable trust founded in 1282.
The bridge was constructed to connect the 39 per cent of London's population that lived east of London Bridge, equivalent to the populations of ""Manchester on the one side, and Liverpool on the other"", while allowing shipping to access the Pool of London between the Tower of London and London Bridge. The bridge was opened by Edward, Prince of Wales, and Alexandra, Princess of Wales, on 30 June 1894.
The bridge is 940 feet (290 m) in length including the abutments and consists of two 213-foot (65 m) bridge towers connected at the upper level by two horizontal walkways, and a central pair of bascules that can open to allow shipping. Originally hydraulically powered, the operating mechanism was converted to an electro-hydraulic system in 1972. The bridge is part of the London Inner Ring Road and thus the boundary of the London congestion charge zone, and remains an important traffic route with 40,000 crossings every day. The bridge deck is freely accessible to both vehicles and pedestrians, whereas the bridge's twin towers, high-level walkways, and Victorian engine rooms form part of the Tower Bridge Exhibition.
Tower Bridge has become a recognisable London landmark. It is sometimes confused with London Bridge, about 0.5 miles (800 m) upstream, which has led to a persistent urban legend about an American purchasing the wrong bridge.


== History ==


=== Inception ===

By the late 19th century, the population and commercial development in the East End of London was increasing, leading to demand for a new river crossing downstream of London Bridge. A traditional fixed bridge at street level could not be built because it would cut off access by sailing ships to the port facilities in the Pool of London between London Bridge and the Tower of London.
A Special Bridge or Subway Committee chaired by Sir Albert Joseph Altman was formed in December 1875 to find a solution. On 7 December 1876, the Committee presented a report recommending a bridge or subway to the east of London Bridge should be constructed, funds permitting.
More than fifty designs were submitted, including one from civil engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette, which was rejected because of a lack of sufficient headroom. None of the designs gained support and it was not until 24 July 1884 that the Bridge House Estates Committee brought forward a report that proposed ""a low level bridge, with mechanical opening or openings"" be built. Following a deputation from the Committee visiting Belgium, Holland, and Newcastle Bridge, a proposal was presented on 28 October 1884 to the Court of Common Council for a mechanical bridge built according to one of three models: Design A, a swing bridge; Design B, a variation of that swing bridge; and Design C a bascule bridge. Design C was recommended and a bill was prepared to present to Parliament.


=== Legislation ===
The Act of Parliament authorising construction received royal assent on 14 August 1885 and is called the Corporation of London (Tower Bridge) Act 1885. The Act was specific about the design of what it (and contemporary media) named ""The Tower Bridge"", rather than just ""Tower Bridge"". Key stipulations were:

The central opening span to be 200 feet clear width with a height of 135 feet above Trinity high water when open, and a height of 29 feet when closed.
The size of the piers to be 185 feet long and 70 feet wide.
The length of each of the two side spans to be 270 feet.
During construction a clear waterway of 160 feet wide had to be maintained for river traffic.
The design of the bridge should be made to accord with the architecture of the Tower of London.
The bridge was to be completed within 4 years from the passing of the Act.
The bridge was to be opened at any time for the passage of any vessels, regardless of any delays to land traffic.
Barry later noted that ""at one time it was intended that the new works should be made suitable for the mounting of guns and for military occupation."" But that ""The latter idea was afterwards to a great extent discarded."" However, the Act provided for ""the senior officer commanding in the Tower [of London]...shall at all times have...the right to occupy the Tower Bridge.""
The extent of the maritime trade conducted at this time between the site of Tower Bridge and London Bridge (a distance of approximately 0.5 miles) is demonstrated in Schedule B of the Act which lists 11 active docks, quays and wharfs operating on the north side of the Thames, and 20 wharfs operating on the south side.
Two further Acts of Parliament were required to extend the time allowed to complete the works. On 12 August 1889 the Corporation of London (Tower Bridge) Act 1889 received royal assent to extend the time allowed for construction by a further four years to 1893 and make various adjustments to neighbouring streets that had proved necessary. The work was not yet complete after those four years, and on 29 June 1893 the Corporation of London (Tower Bridge) Extension of Time Act 1893 received royal assent extending the time by a further year.


=== Construction ===
Construction was funded by the City Bridge Foundation, a charity established in 1282 for maintenance of London Bridge that subsequently expanded to cover Tower Bridge, Blackfriars Bridge, Southwark Bridge and the Millennium Bridge.
Sir John Wolfe Barry was appointed engineer and Sir Horace Jones the architect (who, as the City Architect, was also one of the judges). Jones and Barry designed a bridge with two bridge towers built on piers. The central span was split into two equal bascules or leaves, which could be raised to allow river traffic to pass. The two side spans were suspension bridges, with rods anchored both at the abutments and through rods contained in the bridge's upper walkways.

Construction - overseen by Edward Cruttwell - started on 22 April 1886, with the foundation stone laid by the Prince of Wales on 21 June, and took eight years. The work was divided into eight contracts. Mr (later Sir) John Jackson won three of those contracts and was responsible for the northern approach to the bridge (which started in February 1887), the foundations of the piers and the abutments of the bridge (started February 1887), and the cast iron parapet for the northern approach (December 1887) at a total accepted tender cost of £189,732; Sir W. G. Armstrong, Mitchell, and Co. Ltd, was awarded the hydraulics contract for which they tendered £85,232 (December 1887); Mr William Webster was responsible for the southern approach at £38,383 (July 1888); Sir William Arrol & Co. had the contract for the metalwork of the superstructure at £337,113 (May 1889), which amounted to about 12,100 tons; Messrs Perry & Co won two contracts covering the masonry superstructure (May 1889), and paving and lighting (May 1892) for a total accepted tender of £179,455. The total accepted tender for the eight contracts was £830,005.
On average 432 people worked on the site, although at least 1,200 worked on its construction overall and received invitations to the entertainment provided for the workmen at its opening. Cruttwell was the resident engineer throughout the period of construction (and remained associated with the bridge until his death in 1933). He noted that there were ""only"" ten fatal accidents during the construction: four in sinking the foundations, one on the approaches, and the remaining five on the superstructure.
Two piers, containing over 70,000 long tons (78,400 short tons; 71,123 t) of concrete, were sunk into the riverbed to support the construction. The first caisson was started in September 1886 and it was not until January 1890 that both piers were complete. The reason for the long duration of the foundation works was the need to defer excavation of the second pier until the staging for the first pier had been removed to allow 160 feet of clear water-way for shipping.
More than 11,000 long tons (12,320 short tons; 11,177 t) of steel were used in the framework for the towers and walkways, which were then clad in Cornish granite and Portland stone to protect the underlying steelwork, and achieve the stipulation that the bridge should fit architecturally with the Tower of London.
Jones died in 1887, and Barry took over as architect. Barry later summarised the contributions to the construction of Tower Bridge: ""Mr Fyson, who undertook much of the preparation of the detailed drawings; Mr Stevenson, who had been his assistant with the architectural work; and...most of all...Mr Cruttwell, the Resident Engineer, and Mr Homfray, who superintended the machinery."" Stevenson replaced Jones's original brick façade with the more ornate Victorian Gothic style, which made the bridge a distinctive landmark and was intended to harmonise the bridge with the nearby Tower of London. The total cost of construction was £1,184,000 (equivalent to £170 million in 2023).

Tower Bridge was officially opened on 30 June 1894 by the Prince and Princess of Wales. The opening ceremony was attended by the Lord Chamberlain, the Lord Carrington and the Home Secretary, H. H. Asquith. It was reported that ""few [pageants] have been more brilliant or will have a more abiding and historic interest"" than the opening of Tower Bridge in the history of the City of London, and it was a ""semi-State"" occasion.
In addition to the official opening, the City of London Corporation gave an ""entertainment"", at a cost of £300, to 1,200 workmen and their wives. Edward Cruttwell, who had been in charge of the building of the bridge from the beginning, presided. After dinner, each workman was presented with a commemorative pipe and packet of tobacco, and each workman's wife with a box of sweetmeats.
An Act of Parliament stipulated that a tug boat should be on station to assist vessels in danger when crossing the bridge, a requirement that remained in place until the 1960s.
The bridge connected Iron Gate, on the north bank of the river, with Horselydown Lane, on the south – now known as Tower Bridge Approach and Tower Bridge Road, respectively. Until the bridge was opened, the Tower Subway – 0.25 mi (400 m) to the west – was the shortest way to cross the river from Tower Hill to Tooley Street in Southwark. Opened in 1870, Tower Subway was among the world's earliest underground (""tube"") railways, but it closed after just three months and was reopened as a tolled pedestrian foot tunnel. Once Tower Bridge was open, the majority of foot traffic transferred to using the bridge, as there was no toll to cross. Having lost most of its income, the tunnel was closed in 1898.
The high-level open-air walkways between the towers gained a reputation for prostitutes and pickpockets. Since they were only accessible by stairs, the walkways were seldom used by regular pedestrians and were closed in 1910. The walkway reopened in 1982 as part of the Tower Bridge Exhibition.


=== 20th century ===

During the Second World War, Tower Bridge was seen as a major transport link to the Port of London, and consequently was a target for enemy action. In 1940, the high-level span took a direct hit, severing the hydraulic mechanism and taking the bridge out of action. In April 1941, a parachute mine exploded close to the bridge, causing serious damage to the bascule, towers, and engine room. In 1942, a third engine was installed in case the existing ones were damaged by enemy action. It was a 150 hp horizontal cross-compound engine, built by Vickers Armstrong Ltd. at their Elswick works in Newcastle upon Tyne. It was fitted with a flywheel having a 9-foot (2.7 m) diameter and weighing 9 tons, and was governed to a speed of 30 rpm. The engine became redundant when the rest of the system was modernised in 1974 and was donated to the Forncett Industrial Steam Museum by the City of London Corporation.
The southern section of the bridge, in the London Borough of Southwark, was Grade I listed on 6 December 1949. The remainder of the bridge, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, was listed on 27 September 1973.
In 1960, the upper bridges of the two pedestrian walkways that connected the two main towers were converted from being cantilever bridges, projecting horizontally out into space, to suspension bridges when suspension cables were added. This was to reinforce the strength of the walkways.
In 1974, the original operating mechanism was largely replaced by a new electro-hydraulic drive system, designed by Geoffrey Beresford Hartwell, of BHA Cromwell House, with the original final pinions driven by modern hydraulic motors.
In 1982, the Tower Bridge Exhibition opened, housed in the bridge's twin towers, the long-closed high-level walkways, and the Victorian engine rooms. The latter still houses the original steam engines and some of the original hydraulic machinery.


=== 21st century ===
The bridge closed for a month in 2000 to repair the bascules and perform other maintenance. A computer system was installed to control the raising and lowering of the bascules remotely. However, the system proved unreliable, resulting in the bridge being stuck in the open or closed positions on several occasions during 2005 until its sensors were replaced.
In April 2008, authorities announced that the bridge would undergo a £4 million refurbishment that would take four years to complete. The work entailed stripping existing paint down to bare metal and repainting in blue and white. Before this, the bridge's colour scheme dated from 1977, when it was painted red, white, and blue for Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee. Its colours were subsequently restored to blue and white. Each section was enshrouded in scaffolding and plastic sheeting to prevent the old paint falling into the Thames and causing pollution. Starting in mid-2008, contractors worked on a quarter of the bridge at a time to minimise disruption, but some road closures were inevitable. The completed work should stand for 25 years. The renovation of the walkway interior was completed in mid-2009. The renovation of the four suspension chains was completed in March 2010 using a state-of-the-art coating system requiring up to six different layers of paint. A lighting system based on RGB LED luminaires was installed, concealed within the bridge superstructure, and attached without drilling holes, owing to the bridge's Grade I listing.

On 8 July 2012, as part of the London Olympics, the west walkway was transformed into a 200-foot-long (61 m) Live Music Sculpture by the British composer Samuel Bordoli. 30 classical musicians were arranged along the length of the bridge 138 feet (42 m) above the Thames behind the Olympic rings. The sound travelled backward and forwards along the walkway, echoing the structure of the bridge.
Following the Olympics, the rings were removed from Tower Bridge and replaced by the emblem of the Paralympic Games for the 2012 Summer Paralympics.
In 2016, Tower Bridge was closed to all road traffic from 1 October to 30 December. This was to allow structural maintenance work to take place on the timber decking, lifting mechanism and waterproofing the brick arches on the bridge's approaches. During this, the bridge was still open to waterborne traffic. It was open to pedestrians for all but three weekends when a free ferry service was in operation.


== Design ==


=== Structure ===

The structure was originally designed by Horace Jones but his design had an arch instead of the current high-level footways. Concerns about ships' masts and rigging hitting the arch meant that his design faced objections and Jones ""began to think that the arched form must be given up"". It was at this point in 1885 that John Wolfe Barry partnered with Jones and developed the concept of the ""level soffit for the upper bridge"" which allowed the design to proceed as it stands today. Unusually, Tower Bridge was designed to include three types of bridge: the two spans from the shore to the piers are a suspension bridge; the central, opening span is a bascule bridge; and the high level walkways were cantilever bridges until converted to suspension bridges in 1960.
The main towers ""consist of a skeleton of steelwork, covered with a facing of granite and Portland stone, backed with brickwork on the inside faces."" An octagonal steel column stands at each corner of each tower (119 feet 6 inches long). The smaller abutment towers were ""generally similar...though on a smaller scale.""
""The total length of the bridge, including the abutments, is 940 feet, and the length of the approaches are 1,260 feet on the north side, and 780 feet on the south side. The width of the bridge and approaches between the parapets is 60 feet, except across the opening span where it is 49 feet. The steepest gradients are 1 in 60 on the north side, and 1 in 40 on the south side.""
The central span of 200 feet (61 m) between the towers is split into two equal bascules, or leaves, which project 100 feet out each and extend backwards 62 feet 6 inches within the face of each pier. The bascules, weighing about 1,070 tons each including ballast and paving, are counterbalanced to minimise the force required and allow raising in five minutes and have an arc of rotation of 82° with the centre of the arc, or pivot point, being 13 feet 3 inches inside the face of each pier and 5 feet 7 inches beneath the surface of the roadway.
The two side spans are suspension bridges, each 270 feet (82 m) long, with the suspension rods anchored both at the abutments and through rods contained within the bridge's upper walkways. The pedestrian walkways are 143 feet (44 m) above the river at high tide and accessed by lifts and staircases. These walkways were designed as cantilever bridges for a distance from each tower of 55 feet, with girders bridging the 120 feet between the ends of the cantilevers.
The structure was designed to withstand wind pressures of 56 lb per square foot (2.7 kPa), a design constraint introduced following the Tay Bridge disaster which had occurred just 15 years before the opening of Tower Bridge.
There is a chimney on the bridge that is painted to look like a lamppost. It was connected to a fireplace in a guardroom located in one of the bridge piers.


=== Hydraulic system ===

The original raising mechanism was powered by pressurised water stored in six hydraulic accumulators. There were then two pairs of engines on each pier. Each pair consisted of a larger engine 8 ½ inches in diameter and a smaller one at 7 ½ inches. All eight engines had three cylinders. The reason for two pairs of engines on each pier was to build in redundancy. The machinery was ""equal to twice the requirements of the Board of Trade"", already very rigorous standards established following the Tay Bridge Disaster.
The system was designed and installed by Hamilton Owen Rendel while working for Armstrong, Mitchell and Company of Newcastle upon Tyne. Water at a pressure of 750 psi (5.2 MPa) was pumped into the accumulators by a pair of stationary steam engines. Each drove a force pump from its piston tail rod. The accumulators each comprise a 20-inch (51 cm) ram which sits a very heavy weight to maintain the desired pressure.
The entire hydraulic system along with the gas lighting system was installed by William Sugg & Co Ltd. The gas lighting was initially by open-flame burners within the lanterns, but was soon updated to the later incandescent system.
In 1974, the original operating mechanism was largely replaced by a new electro-hydraulic drive system, designed by BHA Cromwell House. The only remaining parts of the old system are the final pinions, which fit into the racks on the bascules and were driven by hydraulic motors and gearing. Oil is now used in place of water as the new hydraulic fluid.


=== Signalling and control ===

Originally, river traffic passing beneath the bridge was required to follow several rules and signals. Daytime control was provided by red semaphore signals, mounted on small control cabins on either end of both of the bridge piers. At night, coloured lights were used, in either direction, on both of the piers: two red lights to show that the bridge was closed, and two green to show that it was open. In foggy weather, a gong was sounded as well.
Vessels passing through the bridge were required to display signals. By day, a black ball at least 2 feet (0.61 m) in diameter was mounted high up where it could be seen. Night passage called for two red lights in the same position. Foggy weather required repeated blasts from the ship's steam whistle. If a black ball was suspended from the middle of each walkway (or a red light at night) this indicated that the bridge could not be opened. These signals were repeated about 1,000 yards (910 m) downstream, at Cherry Garden Pier, where boats needing to pass through the bridge had to hoist their signals/lights and sound their horn, as appropriate, to alert the Bridge Master.
Some of the control mechanism for the signalling equipment has been preserved and is housed in the Tower Bridge's museum.


== Traffic ==


=== Road ===
During the first twelve months after the opening of the bridge, the average stoppage of road traffic at each bridge lift was six minutes. The average number of vehicles crossing the bridge daily was about 8,000.
Tower Bridge is still a busy crossing of the Thames, used by more than 40,000 people (motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians) every day. The bridge is on the London Inner Ring Road, and is on the eastern boundary of the London congestion charge zone (drivers do not incur the charge by crossing the bridge).
To maintain the integrity of the structure, the City of London Corporation has imposed a 20-mile-per-hour (32 km/h) speed restriction, and an 18-tonne (20-short-ton) weight limit on vehicles using the bridge. A camera system measures the speed of traffic crossing the bridge, using a number plate recognition system to send fixed penalty charges to speeding drivers.
A second system monitors other vehicle parameters. Induction loops and piezoelectric sensors are used to measure the weight, the height of the chassis above ground level, and the number of axles of each vehicle, with drivers of overweight vehicles also receiving fixed penalty notices.


=== Pedestrian ===
Pedestrians can walk across on the bascule bridge when it is down for auto and truck traffic. Ship traffic has priority, meaning traffic using the bascule bridge waits when the bridge opens for ships.
From the outset in 1894, the high-level connection was a pedestrian route and was intended to allow pedestrian movement to continue while the bascule bridge was open for ship traffic. During the first twelve months after opening, the average number of pedestrians using the bridge was about 60,000 daily. The pedestrian walkways in each direction were changed to have glass floors in 2014. Lifts bring pedestrians up to and down from the high level pedestrian bridge. The upper walkways are part of the Tower Bridge Exhibition, which included a tour of how the bascule bridge works. Pedestrians can view the city from the bridge and through its upper walkway. There is a fee for the Tower Bridge Exhibition, tickets are needed.


=== River ===
During the first twelve months after the opening of the bridge, the bascules were raised for the passage of vessels 6,160 times, an average of seventeen times daily. Now, the bascules are raised about a thousand times a year. River traffic is now much reduced, but it still takes priority over road traffic. Today, 24 hours' notice is required before opening the bridge, and opening times are published in advance on the bridge's website; there is no charge for vessels to open the bridge.


=== Cycling ===
Transport for London have proposed Cycle Superhighway 4 to run across Tower Bridge.


== Touring the bridge ==

The Tower Bridge attraction is a display housed inside the Bridge's Towers, the high-level Walkways, and the Victorian Engine Rooms. It uses films, photos, and interactive displays to explain why and how Tower Bridge was built. Visitors can access the original steam engines that once powered the bridge bascules, housed in Engine Rooms, underneath the south end of the bridge.
The attraction charges an admission fee. The entrance is from the Ticket Office on the west side of the North Tower, from where visitors can climb the stairs (or take a lift) to the high-level Walkways to cross to the South Tower. In the Towers and Walkways is interpretation about the history of the Bridge. The Walkways also provide views over the city, the Tower of London and the Pool of London, and include two Glass Floors, where you can look down to see the road and River Thames below. From the South Tower, visitors can visit exit and follow the Blue Line to the Victorian Engine Rooms, with the original steam engines, which are situated in a separate building underneath the southern approach to the Bridge.
Of 1,114 English visitor attractions tracked by Visit England, in 2019 Tower Bridge had 889,338 visitors and was the 34th most visited attraction in England, and the 17th most visited attraction that charged an admission fee. It is one of only three bridges in England tracked as a visitor attraction alongside Clifton Suspension Bridge and The Iron Bridge.


== Reaction ==

Although Tower Bridge is an undoubted landmark, with the City of London calling it ""London's defining landmark"", some professional commentators in the early 20th century were critical of its aesthetics. ""It represents the vice of tawdriness and pretentiousness, and of falsification of the actual facts of the structure"", wrote Henry Heathcote Statham, while Frank Brangwyn stated that ""A more absurd structure than the Tower Bridge was never thrown across a strategic river"".
Benjamin Crisler, the New York Times film critic, wrote in 1938: ""Three unique and valuable institutions the British have that we in America have not: Magna Carta, the Tower Bridge and Alfred Hitchcock."" Architectural historian Dan Cruickshank selected Tower Bridge as one of his four choices for the 2002 BBC television documentary series Britain's Best Buildings. The bridge and its surrounding landscape was depicted in an official BBC trailer for the 2021 Rugby League World Cup (in reference to London being one of the host cities).

Tower Bridge has been mistaken for the next bridge upstream, London Bridge. A popular urban legend is that in 1968, Robert P. McCulloch, the purchaser of the old London Bridge that was later shipped to Lake Havasu City in Arizona, believed that he was buying Tower Bridge. This was denied by McCulloch himself and has been debunked by Ivan Luckin, the vendor of the bridge.
A partial replica of Tower Bridge has been built in the city of Suzhou in China. The replica differs from the original in having no lifting mechanism and four separate towers. The Suzhou replica was renovated in 2019, giving it a new look that differs from the original London design.
Tower Bridge is the emblem of the Greater London Scout Region of The Scout Association and features on the badges of the six London Scout counties.


== Incidents ==

On 10 August 1912, the pioneering stunt pilot Francis McClean flew between the bascules and the high-level walkways in his Short Brothers S.33 floatplane. McClean became a celebrity overnight because of the stunt, and went on to fly underneath London Bridge, Blackfriars Bridge and Waterloo Bridge.
On 3 August 1922, a 13-year-old boy fell off a slipway next to the south side of Tower Bridge. A man jumped into the Thames to save him, but both were pulled under a barge by Butler's Wharf and drowned.
In December 1952, the bridge opened while a number 78 double-decker bus was crossing from the south bank. At that time, the gateman would ring a warning bell and close the gates when the bridge was clear before the watchman ordered the raising of the bridge. The process failed while a relief watchman was on duty. The bus was near the edge of the south bascule when it started to rise; driver Albert Gunter made a split-second decision to accelerate, clearing a 3-foot (1 m) gap to drop 6 feet (2 m) onto the north bascule, which had not yet started to rise. There were no serious injuries. Gunter was given £10 (equivalent to £360 in 2023) by the City Corporation to honour his act of bravery.

On 5 April 1968, a Royal Air Force Hawker Hunter FGA.9 jet fighter from No. 1 Squadron made an unauthorised flight through Tower Bridge. Unimpressed that senior staff was not going to celebrate the RAF's 50th birthday with a flypast, the pilot flew at low altitude down the Thames without authorisation, past the Houses of Parliament, and continued towards the bridge. He flew beneath the walkway, at an estimated 300 miles per hour (500 km/h). He was placed under arrest upon landing, and discharged from the RAF on medical grounds without the chance to defend himself at a court martial.
On 31 July 1973, a single-engined Beagle Pup was twice flown under the pedestrian walkway of Tower Bridge by 29-year-old stockbroker's clerk Peter Martin. Martin, who was on bail following accusations of stock market fraud, then ""buzzed"" buildings in the city before flying north towards the Lake District, where he died when his aircraft crashed some two hours later.
In May 1997, the motorcade of United States President Bill Clinton was divided by the opening of the bridge. The Thames sailing barge Gladys, on her way to a gathering at St Katharine Docks, arrived on schedule and the bridge was opened for her. Returning from a Thames-side lunch at Le Pont de la Tour restaurant with UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, President Clinton was less punctual and arrived just as the bridge was rising. The bridge opening split the motorcade in two, much to the consternation of security staff. A spokesman for Tower Bridge is quoted as saying: ""We tried to contact the American Embassy, but they wouldn't answer the phone.""
On 19 August 1999, Jef Smith, a Freeman of the City of London, drove a flock of two sheep across the bridge. He was exercising a claimed ancient permission, granted as a right to freemen, to make a point about the powers of older citizens and the way their rights were being eroded.
Before dawn on 31 October 2003, a Fathers 4 Justice campaigner climbed a 100-foot (30 m)  tower crane near Tower Bridge at the start of a six-day protest dressed as Spider-Man. Fearing for his safety, and that of motorists should he fall, police cordoned off the area, closing the bridge and surrounding roads and causing widespread traffic congestion across the City and East London.
On 11 May 2009, six people were trapped and injured after a lift fell 10 feet (3 m) inside the north tower.
On 9 August 2021, the bridge remained open after a technical failure. The bridge had opened to let the Jubilee Trust Tall Ship through from 2 p.m. before getting stuck. The bridge was closed and reopened to traffic approximately 12 hours later.

        Reasons for Designation
    
    
        Temple Bar is designated at Grade I, for the following principal reasons:*          Unique public structure of the C17 connected with Britain's most famous architect, Sir Christopher Wren*          Utmost historic significance as the old boundary gate between the City of London and the City of Westminster. It has strong ceremonial associations and served as a backdrop to pageantry and punishment rituals from 1672 to 1878
 
*          Architecturally, it is a notable example of a public monument in the proto-Baroque manner embellished with sculpture by the eminent sculptor, John Bushnell.*          Temple Bar is now the only surviving City of London gateway
 
*          Interesting history of its relocation to Hertfordshire and subsequent return to the capital*          Considerable group value with Wren's St Paul's Cathedral

The two facades of the Bar are identical, having two orders of shallow pilasters: the lower story rusticated Tuscan without an entablature; the upper storey Corinthian with moulded architrave, plain frieze, egg and dart mouldings and dentil and astragal cornice. Lower storey of plain rustication with elongated voussoirs and a scroll-shaped keystone to the central arch, plain keystones to the pedestrian arches. Its simplicity contrasts with the upper storey which is more lavish in ornamental detail. The pilasters create three bays and within the centre bay is a round-headed window, with lugged surround and cartouche bearing oval shield of the cross of St George on the N and the royal arms on the S, the latter bearing the motto of the Order of the Garter: 'Honi soit qui mal y pense', which translated as 'shame on him who thinks evil of it'. In the outer bays there are niches above plain cartouches, containing statues of James I and a Queen on the north and Charles I and Charles II on the south by John Bushnell. The upper storey is surmounted by a segmental pediment with egg and dart mouldings and dentil and astragal cornice and is decorated with a plain tablet surrounded by garlands and flanked by cornucopiae. Above the pedestrian arches, the upper storey is framed by two flamboyant volutes in the manner of a Baroque church façade. Next to these are statues of beasts, two griffins on the north and a lion and a unicorn on the south.  The restored gates, with iron furniture to the north, are from Theobalds Park and date from the time of the Bar's installation in Hertfordshire. Statues of the four beasts on the parapet are new sculptures by Tim Crawley from Fairhaven of Anglesey Abbey. Despite these alterations and repairs approximately 95% of the structure is original. Although it appears to be joined to Juxon House and Paternoster Lodge, Temple Bar is largely free standing, although two high-tensile steel bars knit the Bar and the adjoining structures together. A modern bridge from Paternoster Lodge to the east, suspended above the parapet roof and hidden behind the parapet, provides access to the upper chamber. Neither Juxon House nor Paternoster Lodge is included in the listing.INTERIOR: Modern door in east elevation and single internal space with modern floor, ceiling, and fittings. Lit by four windows, one in each elevation. North and south windows with leaded fanlights; east and west are oculi. The interior and fenestration of the upper chamber are entirely new, although reusing the historical walls and openings. First floor chamber accessed from Paternoster Lodge to the east, via a modern bridge above the flat leaded eastern roof.HISTORY: Temple Bar was built in 1670-72 at the junction of Fleet Street and the Strand, the official boundary between the City of London and the City of Westminster. It replaced earlier structures on the site.The first recording of a barrier at the site was in c.1183, taking its name from the adjacent C12 preceptory of the Knights Templar. By the mid-C16 this older gate was causing traffic problems and the structure was falling into disrepair, though it was not until 1670-72 that the wooden structure was replaced by the current Temple Bar. In 1662, a road widening act was passed and plans for a new Temple Bar advanced, although the City of London would not commit to the work on the grounds of expense and perhaps a suspicion of the King's motives. When Charles offered £1,500 towards the rebuilding and demanded explanations from the Mayor as to the procrastination, the City had no choice but to oblige the monarch. The design of Temple Bar has traditionally been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, who was appointed Surveyor to the King's Works in 1668 or 1669 and had overarching responsibility for all royal building projects. The Bar and its statuary would have been one of the first glimpses for the general London public of the new continental Baroque idiom.The Temple Bar served an important ceremonial function given its unique position on the boundary between the City and Westminster. Monarchs would pause here to request permission to enter the City receiving in turn the Sword of State from the Lord Mayor as a symbol of the City's loyalty. Iron spikes atop the Bar were used to display the heads or quarters of traitors, for the last time following the Jacobite uprising of 1745, leading to the Bar's poplar nickname 'City Golgotha'.  New gates were hung for Nelson's funeral in 1806 and the Bar was draped in black for Wellington's funeral in 1852.Calls for the demolition of Temple Bar began as early as 1766. In the 1860s proposals for new law courts on the Strand, coupled with structural cracks, led to plans to demolish. The demolition, executed in January 1878 by workmen from Messrs Mowlem, Burt and Co, was carefully done with each stone individually numbered and then all removed to a storage yard in Farringdon. In 1887 Sir Henry Bruce Meux bought and transported the stones to his estate in Hertfordshire at a cost in excess of £10,000. The reconstruction of Temple Bar in 1888 was part of a wider scheme of aggrandisement of the house and park. Modifications were made to the structure including the addition of a lodge to its south-east corner and a buttress to the west to support the Bar, as well as a staircase to provide access to the upper chamber, which was to be used for dining and entertaining. Its condition rapidly deteriorated prompting discussions as to its future. Since the early 1950s schemes to bring the Bar back to London have been mooted, and in 1976 the Temple Bar Trust was established to pursue this goal. In 1999 a planning application to remove Temple Bar to the new Paternoster Square development near St Paul's Cathedral was granted, subject to conditions relating to recording and reinstatement, and work was completed in 2004. The structure was formerly a scheduled monument.SOURCES: Kerry Downes, The Architecture of Wren (Reading, 1988) p.124

Transcripts of manuscripts in the Corporation of London Records Office.REASON FOR DESIGNATION: Temple Bar is designated at Grade I, for the following principal reasons:*          Unique public structure of the C17 connected with Britain's most famous architect, Sir Christopher Wren. 
*          Utmost historic significance as the old boundary gate between the City of London and the City of Westminster. It has strong ceremonial associations and served as a backdrop to pageantry and punishment rituals from 1672 to 1878. 
*          Architecturally, it is a notable example of a public monument in the proto-Baroque manner embellished with sculpture by the eminent sculptor, John Bushnell. 
*          Temple Bar is now the only surviving City of London gateway. 
*          Interesting history of its relocation to Hertfordshire and subsequent return to the capital.
*          Considerable group value with Wren's St Paul's Cathedral.

        Summary
    
    
A late C20 High Tech office building and insurance market for the major insurance firm, Lloyd’s. Designed from 1978, begun in 1981 and opened in 1986, to the designs of Richard Rogers Partnership (RRP). Engineers, Ove Arup & Partners (team leader Peter Rice). Lighting scheme by Imagination, 1988.    

                    


    
        Reasons for Designation
    
    
        
The Lloyd's building has outstanding special interest and is listed at Grade I for the following principal reasons:
*    Architectural innovation: a seminal late-C20 building by one of Britain's most significant modern architects.  It exemplifies the High Tech style in Britain, with its boldly expressed services and flexibility of plan throughout the impressive exterior and interior.
*    Historic interest: a purpose-built headquarters for an internationally important organisation that successfully integrates the traditions and fabric of earlier Lloyd’s buildings (including the Adam Room moved originally from Bowood House, the 1925 Cooper façade and fixtures such as the Lutine Bell).
*   Flexibility of design: Lloyd’s was innovative for the in-built flexibility of its design that would respond to changing needs in the market. The robustness of the overall design has allowed regular changes to work satisfactorily, and the essential elements of the building survive remarkably well. New additions, while too new to be of special interest, have been thoughtfully incorporated.
*    Timelessness: the building, which looked to Victorian as well as mid C20 buildings for inspiration, firmly retains the splendour of its awe-inspiring futuristic design, 25 years (at the time of listing in 2011) after it opened. 
*    Group value: Lloyd’s, in the heart of the City of London, has many listed neighbours and it forms a wonderfully incongruous backdrop to many of these in captured vistas throughout the City. It has particular group value with the adjacent Grade II* Leadenhall Market, a significant Victorian commercial building to which Lloyd’s itself nods with its glazed atrium.
*    Celebrated design: one of the best known and admired modern commercial buildings in the country, with international renown that cast the image of the City of London in a new light.

    

                    


        
            History
        
        
            Lloyd’s takes its name from Edward Lloyd, a Welshman who opened a coffee house in Tower Street in 1688. It became a meeting place for seafarers, ship-owners, merchants, and for the first underwriters who insured the ships and their cargoes. By the 1770s this group had found accommodation in the Royal Exchange and, trading as Lloyd’s, it stayed there until the 1920s, when the scale of its members’ operations made a move inevitable. A site was acquired in Leadenhall Street and Sir Edwin Cooper was commissioned to design a prestigious headquarters. The site was awkward, since there was only a small frontage to Leadenhall Street, where Cooper had already designed another building, Royal Mail House. He made the most of the site by setting the building, completed in 1928, behind an imposing triumphal arch and corridor, which led to the ‘Room’, a grandiose 16,000 square foot space where the underwriting business was conducted, laid out on the principle that everyone should be able to see each other. But even so large a space rapidly proved inadequate and in 1936 Lloyd’s acquired Royal Mail House as additional accommodation. Cooper’s buildings survived the war unscathed, but the underwriters acquired bomb-damaged property across Lime Street, where in 1952 they began a second building, with a new ‘Room’, Chairman’s suite and members’ restaurant, traditionally called the ‘Captain’s Room’. Completed in 1957, it was designed by Terence Heysham, successor to Cooper’s practice, in a traditional style embraced by the City. Known as the Heysham Building, it was extensively remodelled by DEGW in 1990-1 and demolished and replaced in 2006-7 by No.51 Lime Street, designed by Foster and Partners. By the late 1970s the Heysham Building had already become too small and a third building was needed, and having outgrown two permanent buildings so quickly made Lloyd’s very concerned to rebuild the Cooper buildings with greater adaptability in mind. It had recently opened an administrative building in Chatham, designed by Arup Associates, but despite the success of this scheme, it eventually resolved to hold an invited competition for such a prestigious and yet sensitive brief. Cooper’s original Lloyd’s building was listed in 1977, which added a further consideration to the design of the new building. The choice of a competition was encouraged by Gordon Graham, then President of the RIBA, who advised that Lloyd’s needed a building strategy rather than simply a design. Twelve firms were initially invited to produce ideas, from which six were shortlisted: Piano and Rogers, Foster Associates, Arup Associates, the American I. M. Pei, Webb Zarafa Menkes Housden from Canada and the French Serete practice. Rogers, his partnership with Renzo Piano by now only a nominal one, assembled the English components of the team that had won the competition for Paris’s Pompidou (Beaubourg) Centre in 1971, including architects John Young and Marco Goldschmied and the engineers Peter Rice and Jack Zunz from Ove Arup and Partners. They secured the commission, in April 1978, because they were able to develop a strategy for Lloyd’s to continue to trade through building operations that were already appreciated as likely to be complex and protracted. The complex brief required two main features in addition to continuity of trading: the creation of a single trading space, or Room, and the potential for expansion and contraction. Lloyd’s members overwhelmingly approved Rogers’s designs in November 1978. When design work began, personal computer technology was only just emerging and the design had to be altered following the realisation that desktop terminals would become a major part of working life. This led to heavier and more dominant service towers, to serve this new technology: power and cabling provision had to be doubled, and cooling capacity dramatically increased. Television screens and computer monitors had to be clearly readable without reflections from the glazing, which is mostly translucent. The six service towers were enlarged, losing their earlier slim and expressive qualities to become the dominant features of the design. Microchips were used in the building to monitor lifts, security and other services: an early example of this technology. On 20th September 1979, the City’s Court of Common Council accepted the recommendation of its planning committee and granted consent for the Cooper building to be demolished and outline permission for the new building on the site. The interior was stripped and the arched portal to Leadenhall Street was retained as one entrance to the new Richard Rogers Partnership building. Demolition of Cooper’s building began in October 1979, and was only completed in February 1981, the underwriters and office staff having been moved piecemeal into temporary accommodation in the Heysham Building. Work on the new building began in June 1981. The Queen Mother poured concrete for one of the main columns in a ceremony in November, and returned in May 1984 for the topping-out. The building was finally occupied in May 1986. Richard Rogers, now Lord Rogers of Riverside, was born in 1933 in Florence. He trained at the Architectural Association and Yale University before setting up the Team 4 practice with Norman Foster and others in 1962. Their house for his in-laws, Creekvean in Feock, Cornwall (1964-7) was listed Grade II in 1998 and upgraded to Grade II* in 2002. Rogers subsequently formed an architectural practice with his then wife, Su Rogers, and from 1970-77, worked with the Italian architect Renzo Piano. Their Pompidou Centre building in Paris, which opened in 1977, is a major landmark of the High Tech style (although with a completely steel frame that was not allowed in the City). Other major works by Rogers include: the Channel 4 Building in Westminster, the law courts in Strasbourg, Bordeaux and Antwerp, the National Assembly of Wales in Cardiff, the Barajas Airport in Madrid and Terminal 5 at Heathrow Airport.

        
        
            Details
        
        
            Materials 
In-situ concrete frame (a result of the City of London's fire regulations which would have required expensive fire protection to a steel frame) of very high quality concrete to combine strength with slimness. Six perimeter towers with stainless steel services (toilet pods, staircases, external lifts, pipes and ducts) dramatically expressed externally. The concrete frame is visible and embraced as part of the aesthetic internally. The weight of the floor grid is transferred via U-beams to the 28 columns by means of distinctive and expressed pre-cast brackets. Members of Rogers’s team studied the latest American concrete techniques in the office of I. M. Pei, and the frame was carefully articulated to avoid staining. John Young, the partner in charge, said that their aim was to create ‘the best concrete building in Britain’. The design appears to be paying homage to American architect Louis Kahn in the slickly finished columns, the strong grid and the coffered ceilings, as honed by Kahn in his Yale Art Gallery extension (1951-3), introduced to Rogers when studying at Yale University in the early 1960s. Stainless steel was preferred to aluminium for the external cladding, again at the behest of the fire authority, with a fine textured finish to give a bright sheen. Steel cranes, painted blue, are permanently sited on upper levels for cleaning and maintenance. The building is set on piled foundations, with propping and underpinning of adjoining buildings because of their considerable depth. The basement acts as a ‘drained box’ with a water-permeable layer beneath the floor slab and a drained cavity between the internal and external skins. The central atrium is defined by a painted latticed steel and glass barrel-vaulted roof and tall window, similarly detailed, facing Leadenhall Place. The building is more highly glazed than is immediately apparent, and was designed to withstand solar gain. A clever solution using triple glazing facilitates an air conditioning system in which cool air is introduced into the building at floor level and stale air is extracted at high level via the light fittings and down a cavity in the triple glazing. Much of the glass is translucent, or ‘sparkle’, glass so the public cannot see into the trading floor, which is a strictly private operation. There are shallow ‘vision strips’ of clear glass placed at sitting or standing level depending on the floor; this was being re-ordered to allow for a greater proportion of clear glass at the time of listing (2011) in a sympathetic manner by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners. The window bays are divided by projecting perforated aluminium mullions, and there are 'fish tail' profile ducts connected to the top of each window, which bring the air from the ceiling to the cavity glass of the wall. Style 
The design ethos of the Lloyd’s building, which exemplifies the High Tech style in Britain, is centred around its inherent flexibility and dynamism. The aesthetic is boldly futuristic, even thirty years after design began, yet while resoundingly modern, Lloyd's was inspired and informed by the great traditions of C19 British engineering, perhaps best seen in the atrium (which responds to the adjacent Leadenhall Market). The asymmetric and soaring expressed towers have also led to the building being described as 'Gothic'. At its heart is the concept of ‘served’ and ‘servant’ space introduced by Louis Kahn, with its clear architectural expression of different functional spaces throughout the building. It is sometimes referred to as ‘the inside out’ building because of the strongly expressed services that define the exterior massing and style. Lloyd’s combines elements of the statuesque and permanent within a dress of the lightweight and disposable. Each elevation is different and part of the architectural excitement is glimpsing different elevations and rooflines from different parts of the City. Plan 
The building comprises a rectangular block of offices, 67m x 45.5m, set back within a cobbled well with walkways linking the building to the pavement. The rectangular concrete structure at the core of the building is defined by 28 cylindrical piers on a 10.8m x 18m grid forming a rectangular courtyard with a central atrium, while the 'satellite' stair and service towers project in a pinwheel fashion around the perimeter. Up to 16 storeys of offices, or galleries in Lloyd’s parlance (the stepped profile of the building means that not all the building is the same height) with a further two floors below ground. Main reception is currently (2011) on the Lime Street side into the lower ground floor (through replaced revolving doors). There are three other entrances: the original main entrance, with canopy, in the base of Tower 1, through the Cooper building on Leadenhall Street into the base of Tower 5 and in the base of Tower 3 on corner of Lime Street and Leadenhall Place. There is a ramp over the well from Leadenhall Street into the entrance of Tower 1. The ground and first floor is dominated by the most significant of the working spaces: double-height with a largely uninterrupted interior, where up to 6,000 underwriters and brokers can make deals and communicate face-to-face. The offices above are organised around the central, galleried atrium that extends the height of the building and culminates in the steel and glass barrel-vaulted roof. The lower seven storeys (lower ground, ground and levels 1-4) are served by a ladder of escalators within the central space; integral fixings at higher levels allow for future expansion of the escalators to upper floors. The design incorporates Robert Adam’s ‘Great Room’ of c.1763 from Bowood House, Wiltshire in gallery 11. The special Lloyd’s term of ‘the Room’ is a semi-abstract concept that refers to all the levels of the building that are occupied by the market at that time. The original design always intended this to be flexible, allowing floor area to be expanded or contracted as the market demanded, and it is considered a fundamental component of its success as a working market building. At the time of listing (2011), the market operates at ground level, and levels 1-3 (levels 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 and part of 3 are let to tenants, although this is subject to change); the Corporation of Lloyd’s occupies levels 5, 6, 12 and part of level 4, while Level 11 contains the Committee suite.Exterior 
The Lloyd’s Building is identified by the six different towers that engulf the rectangular core: three for escape stairs and fire-related services, the others for the external glazed lifts (in natural colours, rather than bright primary colours as at other RRP projects), the pre-fabricated lavatories (for ease of assembly and maintenance) and ducts. The highest towers are to Leadenhall Street (Towers 1, 5 and 6) and are graduated back to where the street grain is lower (next to Leadenhall Market) at Towers 3 and 4. The elevations inbetween are marked by expressed concrete columns which clasp the glazed offices (each storey is 4 horizontal panes of glazing high) with the distinctive brackets, overlapped by horizontal ductwork. The prefabricated toilet cabins are shiny steel boxes with porthole lights, slotted in to their own concrete structure with more slender corner columns and bands between each storey. To Leadenhall Place are a series of stacked meeting room pods, which start at gallery 1 above the vehicle lifts and rise through gallery 6; these steel pods externally appear quite similar to the toilet pods. The stairwells, with their curved apsidal ends are equally shiny, and the slope of the steps is expressed with a deep gap between each floor. The lifts are particularly light with entirely glazed corners and mounted steel fixings supporting the glass instead of being held in a frame. Four of the towers are topped by major three-tiered plant rooms (these are much larger than were originally planned to cope with increased air-conditioning needs and to ease access for maintenance staff). Boldly expressed and chunky cylindrical ventilation ducts (for return air and supply air) in stainless steel have a strongly vertical quality to the top where the re-circulating duct angles into the air handling plant of the towers. The original main entrance, at the base of Tower 1, is identified by a grand cantilevered canopy with a barrel-vaulted glazed profile, which echoes the atrium roof. A small, fully-glazed cabin was added later to the entrance at Tower 1 to accommodate the ‘waiters’ (Lloyd’s special name for its traditional red-coated staff) is too recent to be of special interest. Revolving doors have also been added to this entrance and are not of special interest. A rectangular, dark blue glazed ceramic City of London plaque, commemorating the foundation of the London Penny Post in 1680, is fixed to the wall near the main entrance.To Leadenhall Street, the façade of the Lloyd’s premises designed by Sir Edwin Cooper of 1925-28 (known as the Cooper building) is now treated as a stone screen and the entrance to Tower 5. This was listed at Grade II in 1977,  and has now been consolidated within this listing. The Portland stone classical façade is all that survives. This is dominated by a doorway ornamented with swags and a balustrade, set within a colossal niche with coffered semi-dome. Single windows to 2 storeys at either side, those to ground floor at left and right now carry WWI and WWII war memorials respectively. Five square windows to the enriched upper storey and a full-width pediment with figure sculpture by C.L.J. Doman. There is a plaque to the right announcing: LLOYD’S 1925 with the names of the Chairman and Committee, and identifying Sir Edwin Cooper as the architect.Subsidiary items
The building is tightly fitted into its site and is partly enclosed from the pavement by railings with slender steel uprights and horizontal thin circular steel sections. The railings are generally set on smooth granite copings or a shallow plinth which also form the edge of the wells below the building. The external perimeter ground surface at street level, and down into the well (including the vertical retaining walls of the well) is largely finished with square rough granite setts, of some interest for the way their placement defines the edge of the building and differentiates Lloyd’s access from the public road, but repaired and replaced in a number of areas. The granite steps that lead down to the well beneath the building and up to the various entrances are included in the listing. The modest steel cylindrical bollards are of some interest, but are likely to have been moved or replaced. The two steel flagpoles, presumed to have been added soon after opening, are sited in line with the entrance canopy at Tower 1. An access ramp spans the wells to Leadenhall Street under Tower 1 and beneath Tower 4, and there are various external stairs up to entrances or down to the well and the main entrance. These have a similar railing detail, but with smaller steel section horizontals and perforated uprights. There is one public bar (called 'One Under Lime' in 2011) on the lower concourse on the southwest corner, also near Tower 4. To the south west corner (in what is known as Green Yard) are seven free-standing steel air intake vents, arranged in line, cylindrical on plan and with chamfered tops; these original features contribute to the special interest. The free-standing glass and metal bike shed, set on cobbles to the south of the building, was designed by SPPARC Architects and added in 2007, is too recent to be of special interest.Interior 
The main interior space is organised around the central, soaring atrium with its dominant concrete columnar structure, the dynamic escalators at the base and the vast swathes of glass and steel in the barrel-vaulted roof and end wall. Externally expressed ductwork supplies fresh air and extracts stale air through the build-up of the concrete floor structure. Above the floor slab is a 300mm raised floor zone through which supply air is introduced into the building. Between the floor slab and the structural grid of the coffered ceiling runs a deep services void and in each coffer is a large circular light fitting of spun aluminium through which return air is extracted. Other services are set around the light fittings. The escalators, which connect the lower floors largely given over to underwriting, are fit into one square grid of the structural frame, within the atrium. They have exposed yellow mechanisms behind clear glass panels, which contribute not only to the ethos of exposed services, but to the feeling of dynamism in this busy working space. The escalators connecting the ground floor and level 1 have curved half-landings with curved glass balustrades providing a view into the main trading floor below. The lower and upper basements are largely given over to staff areas, plant rooms, lavatories (fitted out like those in the towers) and kitchens. The lower ground floor houses the main entrance with controlled access to the building, the restaurant and the old library reconstructed from the Cooper building. The old library is a high space with a balcony round it, entirely lined in timber with Ionic pilasters and a narrow apse that combines classical detailing with a sunrise motif that is almost art deco in inspiration. In a corridor outside the library is a re-sited (and lit from behind) war memorial dating from 1958 and representing, in brightly coloured stained glass by Hugh Easton, a valiant St. George with sword against a sunburst with abstract dragon-like frame. The restaurant, formerly known as the Captain’s Room, was designed by Eva Jiricna (who worked for Richard Rogers Partnership before launching her own practice) and had windows and screens like the sails of a ship; these fittings were removed c.2000 and the restaurant and reception were refurbished c.2007. Escalators travel from the lower ground floor to the double-height main trading floor. The main trading floor, which is sometimes likened to a cathedral nave for the great glazed end of the atrium that soars above it, is of predominantly open plan in which the underwriters have their trading ‘boxes’. The wooden boxes, or underwriters’ desks were designed as a ‘kit of parts’ by RRP in 1982 and echoed the traditional arrangement that had carried through from institution’s coffee house days; most of these boxes survive but in almost all cases the original bench seating has been removed. These features are of interest but they are moveable furniture, rather than fittings, so they are not included in the listing. The pictures, carpet, lights and equipment in this room are not fixtures or utilitarian in nature and would be excluded or noted as not having special interest. Also in the main trading floor, prominently sited under the arcade roof, is the Lutine Bell, within a rostrum that takes the form of a grand wooden tempietto, or miniature colonnaded temple of circular plan, culminating in a clock, all designed by Edwin Cooper. This distinctive piece of furniture (the bell has traditionally been rung to indicate good or bad insurance-related news) holds a prominent place at the base of the atrium and is a fixture by virtue of its weight (it is owned by Lloyd’s). The floor of the atrium is white marble. The tenants’ floors were designed for continuous adaptation: originally screened by timber partitions now replaced by translucent glazed partitions that are considered less oppressive and in keeping with the building’s overall lightness. The galleries were designed to either have a perimeter corridor around the atrium, or be completely open plan behind a glazed screen. Galleries 1, 2 and 3 are open to the atrium by a transparent glass balustrade and the galleries above have a full height screen in this position with perforated ribs dividing each bay as in to the outside windows. Gallery 8 and part of gallery 7 retain moveable timber partitions which are of interest, but their moveable nature suggests that their interest is not uniquely tied to their current location in the building. A few of the individual office interiors were designed by Eva Jiricna, working for RRP before she formed her own practice in 1985, but these have since been removed (those on the lower ground floor were removed in 2007), save the panelling on gallery 8. Jiricna also designed some of the furniture, some of which remains, but which is not a fixture. Jiricna was originally also to have designed the interiors of the executive floors, including the offices of the Chairman and other senior officials at Lloyd’s. However, in 1983 Sir Peter Green was succeeded as Chairman by Peter Miller, who commissioned the Paris decorator Jacques Grange to fit out the executive floors in a traditional manner with marble and reproduction furniture. The result was incongruous in its setting and reduced the impact of the Bowood Room at its heart, which Rogers had intended as a ‘jewel box’ of great richness in an otherwise starkly modern interior. The stacked offices to Leadenhall Places (galleries 1-6 inclusive) are wood panelled and originally comprised 1 single room that could be subdivided into 4 rooms with moveable partitions; all have been modified to some degree.Galleries 5 and 6 and part of 4 house the Corporation, or management staff, of Lloyd’s. Gallery 11 contains the Committee suite and Robert Adam’s ‘Great Room’ from Bowood House, designed in 1763 as the drawing room but used from the late 1770s as Bowood’s principal dining room. The room was acquired at auction to become the committee room of the new Heysham Building, and installed in 1957 to altered proportions. RRP made space in their building for the Bowood Room to be reconstructed to its original height and width (having been reduced in size for its tenure in the Heysham Building) with some replicated elements to make up the difference. Ian Bristow was appointed consultant for the removal in January 1983, and a methodical reconstruction was made based on the surviving fragments, the drawings in the Soane Museum and photographs of the room in its original location. The original windows, shutters and architraves had been destroyed in 1956, and had to be remade, along with the chair rail and skirtings. The additional length of ceiling and wider spacings between the plaster dishes were retained, while additional arabesque panels were made between the doors to take up the additional length in the walls. The floorboards are the originals from Bowood, with some additional pieces added in 1956. The old work was supported on a steel framework to which timber grounds were fixed. The whole entity is encased in a double-height solid room in a post-modern style with a deeply rusticated plinth and simple recessed arched niches with flat architraves to each deeply-revealed opening. The original colour scheme for the room was only partially recovered, but these bright colours were deemed inappropriate for the Lloyd’s building, and the paler hues of straw colour and green were adopted as a compromise. New pier glasses were specially made according to Adam’s designs, and tables made based on his drawings for Syon House. The carpet, freestanding furniture, chandeliers and pictures in this room would be excluded form the listing as non-fixtures. There is also a special dining room on gallery 11 (refurbished in 2007) and a wide travertine staircase (designed by Jacques Grange) leading to gallery 12 with a small grid balustrade. Towers 1, 3 and 5 contain a bridge to a lobby, off which there are 4 lifts to one side and lavatory and staircase pods to the other side. The staircases have double-apsidal ends, wrapped around two columns in line. They are lined with stainless steel and feature a cantilevered extruded aluminium tread. The lavatory pods are lined with stainless steel and have ceramic tile and mirrors on the wall and floor services, and solid white Carrara marble sink counters. The following features would be considered to lack special interest in any future designation documentation: internal partitions and their doors (except for the timber partitions on gallery 8), carpets, free-standing furniture, raised floor pans and their pedestals, data cabling, mechanical systems, duct work, hidden plant, fire safety systems, internal block walls in the upper and lower basement areas, window blinds, external lighting scheme, hidden external satellite dishes and aerials on the roof and lift controls. At the time of listing (2011), twenty-five years after its opening, the building survives remarkably well, owing to the inherent flexibility built into its original design and the careful management thus far. Changes include the unfortunate removal of the restaurant interior and meeting rooms designed by Eva Jiricna. There are also thoughtfully-designed but neutral additions such as the waiters’ cabin and bike shed, which are too modern to be included in the listing. The other insertions and removals of partitions were always expected to accommodate different tenants and have been a fact of the management of Lloyd’s since it opened; it is likely that furniture and partitions will continue to be moved as the building remains in active use. Other changes are minor and superficial, and were always intended as part of the flexible design ethos of this dynamic, working building.This List entry has been amended to add sources for War Memorials Online and the War Memorials Register.

It is located on the former site of East India House in Lime Street, in London's main financial district, the City of London. The building is a leading example of radical Bowellism architecture in which the services for the building, such as ducts and lifts, are located on the exterior to maximise space in the interior.
In 2011, twenty-five years after its completion in 1986 the building received Grade I listing; at this time it was the youngest structure ever to obtain this status. It is said by Historic England to be ""universally recognised as one of the key buildings of the modern epoch"". Its innovation of having key service pipes and other components routed outside the walls has led to very expensive maintenance costs due to their exposure to the elements.


== History ==
The first Lloyd's building (address 12 Leadenhall Street) had been built on this site in 1928 to the design of Sir Edwin Cooper. In 1958, due to expansion of the market, a new building was constructed across the road at 51 Lime Street (now the site of the Willis Building). Lloyd's now occupied the Heysham Building and the Cooper Building.
By the 1970s Lloyd's had again outgrown these two buildings and proposed to extend the Cooper Building. In 1978, the corporation ran an architectural competition which attracted designs from practices such as Foster Associates, Arup and Ioeh Ming Pei. Lloyd's commissioned Richard Rogers to redevelop the site, and the original 1928 building on the western corner of Lime and Leadenhall Streets was demolished to make way for the present one, which was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 18 November 1986. The 1928 building's entrance at 12 Leadenhall Street was preserved and forms a rather incongruous attachment to the 1986 structure. Demolition of the 1958 building commenced in 2004 to make way for the 26-storey Willis Building.
The building was previously owned by Dublin based real estate firm Shelbourne Development Group, who purchased it in 2004 from a German investment bank. In July 2013 it was sold to the Chinese company Ping An Insurance in a £260 million deal.
In 2008 the Twentieth Century Society called for the building to be Grade I listed and in 2011 it was granted this status.


== Design ==


=== Features ===
The current Lloyd's building (address 1 Lime Street) was designed by the architect company Richard Rogers & Partners and built between 1978 and 1986. Bovis was the management contractor. Like the Pompidou Centre in Paris (designed by Renzo Piano and Rogers), the building was innovative in having its services such as staircases, lifts, ductwork, electrical power conduits and water pipes on the outside, leaving an uncluttered space inside. The 12 glass lifts were the first of their kind in the United Kingdom. Like the Pompidou Centre, the building was highly influenced by the work of Archigram in the 1950s and 1960s.
Rogers selects primarily concrete and some steel for the structure, utilizing materials appropriate to the site's local logistics. Additionally, Rogers emphasizes that contemporary buildings incorporate both current and historical technologies.
The building consists of three main towers and three service towers around a central, rectangular space. Its core is the large Underwriting Room on the ground floor, which houses the Lutine Bell within the Rostrum.  Also on the first floor is the loss book which for 300 years has had entries of significant losses entered by quill. The Underwriting Room (often simply called ""the Room"") is overlooked by galleries, forming a 60 metres (197 ft) high atrium lit naturally through a huge barrel-vaulted glass roof. The first four galleries open onto the atrium space, and are connected by escalators through the middle of the structure. The higher floors are glassed in and can only be reached via the exterior lifts.
The 11th floor houses the Committee Room (also known as the Adam Room), an 18th-century dining room designed for the 2nd Earl of Shelburne by Robert Adam in 1763; it was transferred piece by piece from the previous (1958) Lloyd's building across the road at 51 Lime Street.

The Lloyd's building is 88 metres (289 ft) to the roof, with 14 floors. On top of each service core stand the cleaning cranes, increasing the overall height to 95.10 metres (312 ft). Modular in plan, each floor can be altered by addition or removal of partitions and walls.


=== Criticism ===
Prince Charles and others initially criticized the design of Lloyd's Building, similar to the backlash of Centre Pompidou. Rogers stated that, ""Lloyds said they wanted two things: they wanted a building that would last into the next century – we made that one – and they wanted a building that would meet their changing needs."" One of those changing needs relates to the much-vaunted design innovation of having the service pipes, ducts, and stairwells outside the walls led to such costs caused by weathering and maintenance that Lloyds considered vacating the building in 2014. 
Lloyd's former chief executive Richard Ward stated: ""There is a fundamental problem with this building. Everything is exposed to the elements, and that makes it very costly.""

        Summary
    
    
Public Library, the present design based on that of 1975-8, built 1982-99, though opened in 1997; architect Sir Colin St John Wilson, with M.J. Long, Douglas Lanham, John Collier, John Honer and many more.
    

                    


    
        Reasons for Designation
    
    
        The British Library designed by Sir Colin St John Wilson with M.J. Long, built 1982-99, is listed at Grade I for the following principal reasons:
*  Architectural interest: for its stately yet accessible modernist design rooted in the English Free tradition with Arts and Crafts and classical influences, crisply and eloquently contextualised by its massing and use of materials which respect and contrast to the St Pancras station and hotel;
*  Materials: for its level of craftsmanship and skilful handling of a range of materials externally and internally, including Travertine, Portland and Purbeck stone, granite, Leicestershire brick, bronze and American white oak throughout, carefully and meticulously detailed;
* Interior: for the well-planned interior spaces comprising the generously lit reading rooms and multi-level atrium, successfully fulfilling the brief to create the nation’s Library;
*  Historic Interest: in the tradition of the Royal Festival Hall, it is a landmark public building incorporating at its heart the King’s Library, given to the nation by George III;
*  Architect: a major work by the eminent architect and academic Sir Colin St John Wilson and his architectural partner, M.J. Long. Wilson has a number of listed buildings to his name notably the St Cross libraries at the University of Oxford (Grade II*);
*  Artistic interest: for the fusion of art with architecture as a component of the design ethos, exemplified by Paolozzi’s Newton in the piazza;
*  Group Value: with the Grade I St Pancras Hotel, Grade II Camden Town Hall and Grade II housing on Ossulston Street. 

    

                    


        
            History
        
        
            The British Library has a long and complex history before it was even imagined on its current site. In 1757 George II presented the Royal Library of 10,500 volumes collected by British monarchs from Henry VIII to Charles II, a gift which brought with it the privilege of receiving a copy of every book registered at Stationers’ Hall. Further donations of manuscripts and state papers followed including the gift of George III’s books by George IV, and the building of the King’s Library was the first phase of the British Museum built in Great Russell Street in 1823-6. In 1852-7 the courtyard of Sir Robert Smirke’s building was infilled by a new Reading Room, designed by his brother Sydney. In 1911 the Copyright Act granted the Library a copy of every book, periodical or newspaper published in Britain. The Newspaper Library had been built at Colindale in 1904-5; in 1914 the Edward VII galleries were opened and in 1937 the North Library was constructed within them. The congestion was intense and delays in waiting for books notorious.The 1943 'County of London Plan' suggested the opening up of land south of the British Museum in Bloomsbury to form an open space and provision for new library facilities, although ideas of opening up a vista from the British Museum go back much further, for example to W. R. Lethaby’s idea of the ‘Sacred Way’ linking it to Waterloo Bridge made in 1891. In 1962 Sir Leslie Martin and Colin St John Wilson were among a number of architects invited to compete by interview for the project, just as they were completing the St Cross group of libraries for Oxford University. These were three libraries, reached at different levels off an external staircase that forms the centrepiece of the design. The small library for the Institute of Statistics has gone, but the English and Law libraries are both square and top lit, with galleries and peripheral carrels. For Leslie Martin evolution was more important than innovation, something he noted that Alvar Aalto had identified in his own library work, and he suggested in his 'Buildings and Ideas', 1933-83, from the Studio of Leslie Martin and his Associates, Cambridge University Press, 1983, that having determined an ideal plan at St Cross, which was repeated for each of the three libraries there, it only needed refinement elsewhere. This idea was developed further by Wilson.Wilson felt that the success of the St Cross libraries recommended him and Martin to the Ministry of Public Buildings and Works. Nevertheless their first proposals combined the stepped internal courtyard plan of St Cross (and their other university work) within a larger context. The first scheme, approved early in 1964, was an ambitious project that created a piazza south of the British Museum down to Nicholas Hawksmoor’s St George’s, Bloomsbury. To the east would be a new library for books, maps, music and manuscripts, while to the west would be a gallery, archives for prints and drawings, and a conference centre. There would also be a residential development, with shops, publishers’ offices and a public house.Elements of Martin and Wilson’s St Cross scheme can be seen in the eastern block of the proposal, and of the practice’s Harvey Court, Cambridge, in the western, but on a scale and grandeur that was unprecedented, and with a basement archive going down some seven storeys under the piazza. Then a new Labour Government asked for a scheme that would also include the Science and Patents departments as well as the Library’s humanities collections. The desire for a doubling of the library accommodation coincided with growing conservation pressure, always sensitive in Bloomsbury, which demanded the retention of properties on Bloomsbury Square and a consequent reduction in the size of the development site. Martin withdrew in 1970. In 1972 Wilson produced a dense scheme for a large new British Library - a square, stepped block for the main collections and a long wing for the Science Collections, together with a residential precinct of stepped terraces running eastwards from St George’s Bloomsbury. Recognising the scale of what was required, in 1973 the Government instead purchased nine acres of the St Pancras Goods Yard then being vacated by British Rail, and Wilson set to work on a new scheme in 1975. The brief was now to serve an independent British Library, formed by the British Library Act of 1972 that brought together the British Museum Library, the National Central Library and the National Lending Library for Science and Technology. In 1980 a small extension by Wilson to the British Museum on Museum Street was opened.The BL site is a wedge-shaped piece of land bounded by Euston Road to the south, by Midland Road to the east and by Ossulston Street to the west. Wilson’s designs, which rapidly gained approval in 1978, retained the idea of placing the Science and Patent collections in a long wing, which with conference facilities and staff offices lines Midland Road. A series of square, top-lit libraries with galleries, serve the remaining collections, with a large general reading room, and specialised libraries for studying rare books, music and maps. Between the two areas was planned a vast Reference Reading Room an entrance hall, and a new piazza on to the Euston Road. Wilson’s aim was to create an environment that was ‘vivid, pleasurable and memorable, while fitting with responsibility and sensitivity into its context’. The RIBA Journal for April 1978 (from which that quotation is taken) estimated that it would take twenty years to build. The Bloomsbury scheme was described as ‘monumental’ and ‘classical’, that at St Pancras ‘a contemporary, stripped vernacular look’ (Building Design, 10 March 1978) yet within the context of Wilson’s whole body of work the similarities are greater than the differences, and show the evolution of his designs in the manner Martin and Aalto considered so important.In 1978 the decision was made to build the design in three phases. Work began in 1982, when Princes Charles laid the foundation stone, but following extensive tests to the foundations the main building campaign began in 1984. The engineers, Ove Arup and Partners, faced a monumental task in constructing such a deep basement area out of the London clay so near major London Underground tunnels and next to the Grade I-listed St Pancras Station and Hotel. Phase 1, representing c 60% of the whole project, was sub-divided into three for the purposes of measuring annual expenditure targets. Phase 1a provided an equivalent space to that existing in Bloomsbury, with Phases 1b and 1c allowing for moderate expansion. The existing building is essentially a reduced version of phase 1 - following a decision made in December 1987 to complete the building to this reduced scale, leaving the scheme with scarcely more seats than had the old Reading room in Bloomsbury. Wilson commented that ‘it was like constantly pulling a plant up by the roots to see if it was still alive and then cutting a bit off before shoving it back in the ground’ (Stonehouse, 2007, 111). The design as built was more sophisticated than the original. The Humanities and specialist reading rooms were already grouped in two square, top-lit areas (making for a larger entrance courtyard than in the 1978 design) and the Science collections given their separate wing. In 1986-7 Wilson replaced the original Reference Reading Room  with a central glazed casket or shrine, the King’s Library - likened by him to the Kaaba at Mecca but also with similarities to the Beinecke Rare Book Library at Yale University in New Haven by Gordon Bunshaft of SOM, and placed comprehensive café facilities behind it. A library for the India Office collection and exhibition areas were designed at this stage. To the rear, the north elevation was designed to allow for future extension. The principal works of art, including Eduardo Paolozzi’s Newton (1995) after William Blake and a tapestry based on R. B. Kitaj’s If Not, Not, were commissioned at this time. The leather reader chairs were specially designed by Ron Carter.It was also in 1990 that the National Audit Office complained that it was the very decision to phase the work that had cost so much time and money, made worse by the subsequent sub-division of that phasing, and the stop-go funding of the project throughout the 1980s. The project was split between the Office of Arts and Libraries and the Property Services Agency - in fact the only people not to be criticised by the National Audit Commission were Wilson and his design team, who provided the only continuity through the project.Sir Colin St John Wilson (1922-2007), Professor of Architecture at Cambridge University between 1975 and 1989, began his career at London County Council where he collaborated with (Sir) Leslie Martin, among many others, before becoming a lecturer in Architecture at Cambridge in 1956 where Martin was Professor. Wilson and Martin worked together on a number of projects, but Wilson is undoubtedly best known for his design of the British Library, a project of some 30 years duration. A highly influential architect of the post-war period, his renown is attested by 10 of his buildings being designated, including the Oxford University St Cross Library building (1961-5) and Harvey Court halls of residence at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge (1961-2) both listed at Grade II*. Wilson's principal architect partner was M.J Long (b.1939). M.J. Long studied at Smith College in Massachusetts, and received her MArch from Yale in 1939. She worked for Sir Colin St John Wilson from 1965 to 1996, as a partner from 1974, and latterly a director. She also ran a separate practice (MJ Long architect) from 1974 to 1996.ALTERATIONS: there have been a number of minor alterations to the Library’s fabric, primarily to adapt the facilities to changing needs of the public and to comply with the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) provisions. These include:
-   External installation of DDA-compliant ramps and handrails, bollards to external entrances and lighting to the Newton statue and clock tower;
-   Reading Rooms: altering reading room counters; installing electronic resource desks in the Rare Books Reading Room; converting a shelved storage area on the Lower Ground floor and installing a glass partition in Science 1 Reading Room;
-     Public realm: installation of automated door openers in public areas to improve access;
-     Conference Centre: refurbished in 2010, including the recovering of the auditorium seating.In addition, the British Library have carried out ongoing maintenance and upgrading of office spaces, lifts, lighting, CCTV, fire alarms and access controls.
        
        
            Details
        
        
            Public Library, the present design based on that of 1975-8, built 1982-99, though opened in 1997; architect (Sir) Colin St John Wilson, with M.J.Long, Douglas Lanham, John Collier, John Honer and many more. The structural engineers were Ove Arup and Partners, with mechanical engineering services from Steensen Varming and Mulcahy and quantity surveyors Davis Langdon and Everest. William Lam advised on lighting.The Conservation Centre: although attached to the rear north elevation (Long and Kentish, 2006), the centre is a separate building and very recent in date. It is not part of the special interest of the Library.Works of art: some significant internal and external works of art associated with the design of the library, contemporary with its completion and opening, and supported by outside sponsorship are of special interest and included in the listing. Where this is the case, these are specifically mentioned in the List entry. Other free-standing or ‘curated’ works are not included.
STRUCTURE AND MATERIALSThe building has a concrete frame, based on 7.8m x 7.8m column centres, clad inside and out in red brick (hand-made, sand-faced dark Victorian Reds from Leicestershire) laid in stretcher bond, chosen because they were made of the same clay as those used for the adjoining St Pancras Station and Hotel immediately to the east. In a contrasting red to the brick there are metal sills and cornice bands, and cladding to the columns, the latter with stylized classical motifs, and dark green metal fascias to the science rooms, colours inspired by the adjacent St Pancras Station and Hotel. Special stainless steel wall ties allow vertical movement between the series of sub-frames and the brick skin. There is a granite plinth to the Midland Road elevation, with plaster and panelling contrasted with brick and tile within; external columns are clad in steel. The stepped roofs are slate-covered, again akin to St Pancras Hotel, contrasting with the steel screens shielding the clerestory glazing. The brick and stone paviours to the forecourt are continued within the building.Interior joinery throughout is in American White Oak, with maple used only in the Conference Centre. The floor and wall finishes are of Travertine, Portland Whitbed, and Purbeck limestone, with contrasting Travertine and brick paviours on the ground floor of the atrium. In general the door furniture and stair handrails are in brass, the latter over bound with leather, with a bronze structure to the King’s Library.PLANThe building comprises two main blocks of libraries above ground, linked by a central entrance range, with a large piazza over four tiers of basement stacks on piled foundations, and small additions to the rear. The basement is divided by the tunnels of the Northern and Victoria Lines, with resilient bearings separating the conference centre structure from the Hammersmith and City/Circle Lines. The frontage parallel to Euston Road contains the main entrance and atrium, with the King’s Library and restaurants behind; to the west (left) are the humanities, rare books and music libraries; to the east (right) the science and patent libraries adjoin the conference centre (with its own entrance) parallel to Midland Road, making an acute angle, with a vertical clock tower containing service shafts between the west block and entrance range. Additional public and staff entrances are along Midland Road.EXTERIORThe south elevation facing the piazza includes the main ENTRANCE. Steps lead to the sliding entrance doors, set at grade under a canopy with a display window to the gift shop to the left; the ramp to the right of the steps was constructed in 2014. To the left (west) of the entrance, each panel of the five-bay, four-storey frontage (housing internally the exhibition rooms and shop), has two metal roundels, above which is an additional step and clerestory to the roof. The western block is itself divided into two six-bay blocks, each of six bays, to the west with double-stepped pitched roofs, and a flat roof to the raised set-back block in between.A ten-bay block to the east (right) rises to six main storeys with staff facilities behind, its height determined in relation to the hotel and station across the road to the east; panels of brushed metal sun shields are repeated on the east and west elevations. The CLOCK TOWER rises above the junction between the east block and the stepped roofscape of the entrance. The clock near to the apex faces south with stepped brick and red metal detailing above. Feature spotlighting added to the base of the clock tower in 2014 is not of special interest.The CONFERENCE CENTRE adjoins seamlessly to the south, its entrance at the forecourt elevation, with a large porthole opening above to light the stairs within, and its raked pent roof-line presenting a bold face to Euston Road, broken by two bands of projecting triple-glazed fenestration with sun screens at the south-east corner. To Euston Road, a modest kiosk café and an undercover ramp (added in 2010) that leads through to the piazza are not of special interest. On the Midland Road elevation a colonnade, with metal railings in between, rises from a Royken granite plinth and supports the projecting and stepped east wing above with long strip windows defined by louvred metal sun screens and interrupted by a projecting ‘V’-shaped staircase ‘oriel’ window; the soffit is coffered. The north elevation has landscaped roof terraces incorporating a circular pergola and a projecting stair tower.The rear (north) elevation was intended by Wilson to allow for further phases of building (see history above). It has a series of stepped terraces repeating the same idiom of brick panels and paviours, with planters and a square-patterned trellis and balustrade somewhat reminiscent of Frank Lloyd Wright. There is a broad public terrace with planting boxes leading out from the large staff restaurant, which has a fully-glazed facade shielded by metal screens; above it is an enclosed terrace, including a circular pergola surrounding fixed wooden seating. The west elevation (to Ossulston Street) and rear elevation of the western block is supported on red columns with deep bracketed eaves and has a stepped roof; an external circular escape stair for the humanities reading room, constructed with radial bricks, is attached to the rear.Despite the contrast of square and diagonal, the structure of the two blocks is on a strong square grid, reminiscent of that which governs Wilson’s nos. 2 and 2a Granchester Road, Cambridge (a pair of houses of 1961-64, one of which with a studio for himself, listed at Grade II, NHLE ref 1392069), and which appears in details such as coffering, doors and screens, the supports of the uplighters, glazing, grilles and trellises. Common ingredients are set out in Stonehouse (2007).PIAZZA, PORTICO AND EXTERNAL ARTWORKSTo the south (front) of the main entrance is a forecourt known as the piazza with brick paviours set within a grid of limestone slabs that includes steps, raised levels and a rotunda defined by walls topped with granite boulders at the entrances; Sir Antony Gormley’s ‘Planets’ installation of 2002, noted but at the time of the inspection (2015) but is not part of the special interest of the building. There are flag poles and a temporary, free-standing café on the piazza; neither the café here* nor other cafes* within the building’s envelope, or the flagpoles* are included in the listing. DDA compliant handrails have been added in a number of places and are not of special interest. A raised plinth at the point of intersection between the main south and angled, ramped south-eastern entrance incorporates Eduardo Paolozzi’s Newton (after Blake), installed in 1995, an integral part of Wilson’s composition and made by the Morris Singer Foundry with raised planting behind. Feature lighting for Newton, with an associated plinth made by East Coast Casting, was added in 2014 and is not part of the special interest of the building. To the south on the Euston Road entrance, the square brick entrance gateway, known as the Portico, forms a rectangular frame to an angled entrance, with a stone panel incised with the name ‘The British Library’ repeated in the pattern of the iron gates and their high overthrow, by David Kindersley and Lida Cardozo. The bronze chair, Witness, by Sir Antony Gormley, installed in 2011, is noted but is not part of the special interest of the building.
INTERIORThe interior of the Library combines quiet, top-lit reading rooms in the west and east blocks joined centrally by a complex space of multiple entrance concourses arranged in terraces organised with the King’s Library at the core.Freestanding furniture throughout is noted because it was designed by the architects (with Reading Room chairs by Ron Carter) but cannot be included in the listing. Fixed furniture is included in the listing unless stated otherwise.Interior artworks: the British Library retains numerous works of art as part of their collections, some of which are displayed within the building. However, for ease of their curation, and in recognition that they may be donated items, these works of art* are not included in the listing, although purpose-built architectural elements for housing them may be included and will be specified.PUBLIC REALMEntrance and catering areas: bronze sliding and double entrance doors lead to a low vestibule with shop and exhibition halls to the west (left), from which stairs rise to an atrium on four main levels with galleries reached off dog-leg stairs to left, a ramp and a more dramatic spiral stair to right, set behind stairs to the lower ground and a low fountain. Travertine columns contrast with Portland limestone floors in two colours; internal porthole openings light the spaces to the right. The cyma curve roof incorporates clerestory glazing with top lighting to the rear and inset spots; the hanging lights are by Juha Leviska. The central control desk divides access to this main space into two. The main foyer at ground level is defined by built-in seating and balustrading of travertine, with plant troughs. A bronze chair* by Gormley, was installed on the ground floor c.2012 but is not part of the special interest of the building.The lower ground floor has travertine columns, beams, dado and lift surrounds (as repeated in the rest of the building), limestone and brick paviour floors. The cloakroom has a sinuous counter * and  banks of oak lockers* are attached to the walls; these are not included in the listing. Access to offices lie through double doors to the left. Fixed sculptures integral with the building are Anne Frank by Doreen Kern was installed in this location in 2003 and is not of special interest. Paradoxymoron is a painting of 1996 by Patrick Hughes. The reconfigured education space* on this floor is not included in the listing.To the centre of the ground floor are sets of escalators next to the stairs of limestone with Travertine balustrades leading to the Upper Ground Level and Level 1; handrails – like the door handles – here and through the building are wrapped in leather with brass curves, inspired by those of Gunnar Asplund and Alvar Aalto. In the lift lobby at Upper Ground Level is a model * of the Library set on a plinth*, cut to reveal the basement stacks below the piazza, which is not included in the listing.There is much art on display in the entrance atrium. A wall tapestry, conceived as part of Wilson’s original design, based on R. B. Kitaj’s If Not, Not, made by Edinburgh Weavers was moved to the side of the front entrance in 2013. A statue of Shakespeare* (a replica based on that by Roubiliac 1758) stands to the left of the stairs to the west wing above a stepped, inscribed plinth marking the opening of the Library by Queen Elizabeth II on 25 June 1998. On the west wall of the atrium, four busts* in red steel roundels of the donors to the collections (Sir Thomas Grenville, Joesph Banks, Sir Robert Cotton and Sir Hans Sloane) are also replicas. The statue of Shakespeare* and busts of the donors* are noted because of their prominence in the atrium but are replicas and are not included in the listing although their architectural plinths are included.Banks of lifts serve the two sets of reading rooms either side of the atrium, the lobbies of which have travertine detailing and limestone borders to the carpeted floors. All carpet* is of standard contract range and not included in the listing. All lifts* in the library are utilitarian and are not included in the listing. Other balustrading is formed of simple steel uprights with a brass top rail. There is built-in bench seating within travertine walls, and black fossil limestone paving to the rear gallery serving the cafe at Upper Ground Level, with kitchen and staff restaurants behind on Level 1, separated by oak doors and louvres. The fixtures* and fittings* of all catering areas, restaurants and lounges for both public and staff use, including seating*, counters*, vending equipment and kitchen equipment*, are not included in the listing.A belvedere at Level 1 gives views across the foyer. Two more floors above this level have walkways and balconies at the rear over the entrance to the servery. A corridor, with a built-in travertine seat, leads to the staff restaurant and outside terraces for staff and public, including the pergola garden. Limestone floors also serve the lower restaurant area, the stair to which has a built-in travertine handrail and inset lights; there are travertine stall risers to the servery.Exhibitions: at the Upper Ground floor of the western range, beneath the Rare Books Library, is the Sir John Ritblat Gallery, a permanent display of the ‘Treasures of the British Library’, with a central service core and concrete columns with afromosia veneer coating. Here there is a combination of free standing temporary cases which not of special interest and, attached to the enclosing walls, permanent cases contemporary with the building. Stairs lead down to the Paccar Gallery for temporary exhibitions, which partly underlies the ‘Treasures’ exhibition, with access points from both the Ground and Lower Ground floors; the wall partitions in the Paccar exhibition and the stairs between the Paccar and Treasures exhibition spaces* are functional and do not form part of the listing. The adjacent exhibition workshops* are classed as office areas and are not included in the listing. Stairs with travertine risers and steel and brass handrails lead down from the ground floor to the Paccar Exhibition space but beyond this point the exhibition partition walls*, fixtures* and fittings* are temporary, not fixed and not included in the listing. At the Upper Ground floor, to the rear of the foyer, is a temporary exhibition area, again with free standing fittings, masking the view of the King’s Library at this point; the exhibition panels* and structure* are not included in the listing because of their temporary nature.Shop and Box office: flanking each side of the atrium’s ground floor, both the shop* and box office* have C21 shop fronts* and fittings* and are not included in the listing.Reader Registration* is a remodelled office area at Upper Ground level which is not included in the listing. Toilets* for staff and public throughout the building are utilitarian and are not included in the listing.READING ROOMS AND THE KING'S LIBRARYThere are 11 reading rooms in total, divided broadly into humanities on Levels 1 to 3 in the west block, fronting Ossulston Road, and science in the east block on Levels 1 to 3, fronting Midland Road.King’s Library: rising in the centre of the building behind the foyer, the King’s Library is accessed from a bridge over a narrow ‘moat’ at the Upper Ground floor through heavy bronze double doors. It is a six-storey glazed casket, served by an internal lift and escape stairs, with an independent structure comprising a bronze framed curtain wall set within a trough or moat, travertine walled with a glass balustrade and black marble base. Wilson described it (1998, references below) as ‘an object in its own right … simultaneously a celebration of beautifully bound books, a towering gesture that announces the invisible presence of treasures housed below and a hard-working sources of material studied in presence of treasures houses below and a hard-working source of material studied the Rare Book Reading Room opposite: the symbolic is at one with the use’. The books are placed on outward-facing shelving as close to the glass as is feasible, on stacks which move inwards while allowing air movement for the preservation of the books, so that the bindings can be enjoyed. Subtle lighting within alternate mullions inside the cases highlights the bindings. At the centre are fixed stacks. There is a bust of George III* by Peter Turnerelli,1812 on a black marble plinth, of note, but not included in the listing.Humanities Reading Room: access to the Humanities Reading Room is at level 1 in the west block. This lofty, triple-height and essentially square space, receives generous daylight through rooflights and clerestories with a coved ceiling sweeping up to the top-floor clerestory. Inserted on two sides are the two projecting and stepped upper floors, enclosed by giant square piers accessed by internal timber-lined stairs; the third being the map room. The piers are panelled to shoulder height in American White Oak incised with delicate lines, imitating fluting; all timber detailing used for the balustrades, desks and wall shelving and joinery is American White Oak. The pierced oak balustrading to the upper floors has elongated stanchions, repeated as a vertical motif in the cornice that makes a feature of the air ducts and lighting troughs below, and countered by the multiple vertical shafts of the up-lighters; the built-in oak desks have square patterns incorporating lights and sockets, and brushed black steel built-in lights. Other finishes are in impact-resistant, glass reinforced gypsum (GRG) rather than plaster, for ease of maintenance, plain or sparely detailed with stylized classical motifs with Japanese overtones. All these square and vertical patterns have sources in Frank Lloyd Wright, whose Robie House Wilson particularly admired. This plan form derives from that of Leslie Martin’s Law Library at St Cross, Oxford, designed in association with Wilson and built in 1959-63. The Control and issue desks match the American White Oak panelling and shelving of the walls, and like the desks and chairs are by the architects. The chairs are not fixed, thus are ineligible for listing, but the reading desks, with leather tops, mostly are; some are modified for DDA compliance, others altered to take computer processor units with additional electrical supply for lap-tops.Adjacent to Humanities is the Rare Books and Music Reading Room, with the Manuscript Reading Room on the single balcony above. The details here are repeated on a more modest scale, with conoid-topped columns and flatter slopes to the ceiling. Carrels or sound booths against the perimeter wall are built in to the music library, originally, it is said to accommodate those wishing to use portable type writers; the film reader room is alongside. Doors throughout the reading rooms are of American White Oak with brass and bound leather handles, glazed to the booths and film-reader room.Science Reading Rooms: the eastern block housing the science and social science collections is on three floors, topped by a coffered ceiling that is upswept to the top of the main windows, with a balustrade protecting the ducting below. On the other side are two stepped back galleries with broad timber ledges topped by brass handrails. To the street (Midland Road) it has large, continuous side windows, with in between carrels, desks and a connecting stair with glass balustrades. There are more bookcases for material on open shelves than is found in the humanities libraries; those in freestanding, moveable units* are not included in the listing. There are broad timber ledges to the balconies. Control and issue desks match the oak panelling and shelving of the walls, and like the tables and chairs (not fixed, and the same as those in the humanities reading rooms and not included in the listing) are designed by the architects. Some additional internal glass partitioning was added in 2012 and is not of special interest.Business and IP Centre: on Level 1 of the east block, formerly a science reading room, the Business and IP Centre has a modernised entrance foyer and inserted glass meeting rooms; the foyer and meeting room partitions* are not included in the listing. The high windows are over-built in shelving and a single gallery whose balustrade is lined in timber (former Science North reading room), linked by a spiral stair (also with a timber balustrade) and with shelving on both levels. Ducts form a cornice, the square columns are timber lined to dado height, and there are built-in desks, not all with reading lamps; the wall shelving is lit with downlights.Newsroom: on Level 2 in the east block, the newsroom created from a former science reading room in 2014, has a reconfigured foyer* and renewed fixtures* and fittings* and a digital screen* installed. It is not included in the listing.Asian and African Studies Reading Room: on Level 3 in the east block, formerly the Indian Office Library, is a double-height space so that the historic picture collection can be hung. The fittings are similar to those in the other Reading Rooms.OFFICES AND BASEMENTThe staff offices are located to the rear of the east and central blocks, the principal entrance being the staff entrance gate (gate 8) from Midland Road. The offices* are adaptable spaces with standard furniture*, fixtures* and fittings* and are not included in the listing with the exception of the 4th Floor Executive office which is included in the listing as a representative example.Access to the reading rooms and public realm is via stairs to the rear and lifts; there are no notable fixtures and fittings here except for the carved, timber war memorial to all Library Association librarians from the Commonwealth lost in the First and Second World Wars which is fixed to the wall opposite the main lifts to the science reading rooms and is included in the listing. At the rear also is the staff restaurant with timber dado repeated in the maple battens fixed to the bases of circular columns and hanging lights by Louis Poulsen. On Level 4 of the east block is the Board room and its adjacent Executive Office suite, a ‘staff’ area with meticulous travertine and American White Oak finishes; the Board room furniture is by Ron Carter and where fixed is included in the listing.Beneath the piazza are four vast basement floors* with overpainted brick walls, mechanical and motorised stacking and secure pens for rare and valuable items. On Basement level two is the control room for the Mechanical Book Handling System (MBHS), a bespoke conveyor belt system transporting items in trays to and from the basement to the reading rooms’ service desks via lifts. As part of the integral design of the Library the basements and MBHS are noted here, but none of the basement levels*, their fixtures and fittings* are included in the listing.  Collection item storage areas* on other floors, including large areas of the Lower Ground Floor, Manuscripts and Philatelic Storage Rooms are not included in the listing.Loading bays*, plantrooms*, cores*, lift-shafts*, and other utility and service areas* are not of special interest and are not included in the listing.
CONFERENCE CENTRERefurbished in 2010, the centre serves the Library and external functions and is entered from the forecourt through bronze doors, with lower and upper foyers, served by a travertine lined stair well, the treads in Purbeck marble and Portland stone. The lift wall and dado are in travertine with limestone floors and maple joinery. There is a 250-seat auditorium accessed on two levels (seating recovered in 2010) and four seminar rooms seating 20-65 people, of these only the double-height Elliott Room is of special interest; the others have standard fixtures* and fittings*. A large foyer with a bar is reached by a broad travertine-lined stair incorporating built-in seating, and leather-bound brass handrails, dubbed the ‘Spanish Steps’ by Wilson to denote his intention that they be a meeting and conversation place. The toilets* and cloakroom* are not included in the listing.
SUBSIDIARY FEATURESThe entrance adjoins walls to Euston Road and Ossulston Street; the latter has two pairs of set-back gates, the first into the forecourt, the second to the rear of the western wing, and railings set on a low, stone-capped wall with brick piers. The semi-circular planters* to the Euston Road frontage and railings between and including Gate 10 and Gate 9* fronting Midland Road (installed in 2008) are not included in the listing.* Pursuant to s.1 (5A) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (‘the Act’) it is declared that these aforementioned features are not of special architectural or historic interest.This list entry was subject to a Minor Amendment on the 17/08/2016

It is one of the largest libraries in the world. It is estimated to contain between 170 and 200 million items from many countries. As a legal deposit library, the British Library receives copies of all books produced in the United Kingdom and Ireland, including a significant proportion of overseas titles distributed in the United Kingdom. The Library is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.
The British Library is a major research library, with items in many languages and in many formats, both print and digital: books, manuscripts, journals, newspapers, magazines, sound and music recordings, videos, play-scripts, patents, databases, maps, stamps, prints, drawings. The Library's collections include around 14 million books, along with substantial holdings of manuscripts and items dating as far back as 2000 BC. The library maintains a programme for content acquisition and adds some three million items each year occupying 9.6 kilometres (6 mi) of new shelf space.
Prior to 1973, the Library was part of the British Museum, also in the Borough of Camden. The Library's modern purpose-built building stands next to St Pancras station on Euston Road in Somers Town, on the site of a former goods yard. There is an additional storage building and reading room in the branch library near Boston Spa in Yorkshire. The St Pancras building was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 25 June 1998, and is classified as a Grade I listed building ""of exceptional interest"" for its architecture and history.


== History ==


=== Early foundations  (1972–1997) ===
The British Library was created on 1 July 1973 as a result of the British Library Act 1972. Prior to this, the national library was part of the British Museum, which provided the bulk of the holdings of the new library, alongside smaller organisations which were folded in (such as the National Central Library, the National Lending Library for Science and Technology and the British National Bibliography). In 1974 functions previously exercised by the Office for Scientific and Technical Information were taken over; in 1982 the India Office Library and Records and the HMSO Binderies became British Library responsibilities. In 1983, the Library absorbed the National Sound Archive, which holds many sound and video recordings, with over a million discs and thousands of tapes.
The core of the Library's historical collections is based on a series of donations and acquisitions from the 18th century. These are known as the ""foundation collections"", and they include the books and manuscripts of Sir Hans Sloane (d. 1753), whose decision to donate his library and natural history collection to the nation led to the formation of the British Museum. The trustees of the museum also purchased the Harleian Library collection of Robert Harley (d. 1721) for £10,000; Also provided to the library was the Cotton library, the former collection of Sir Robert Cotton (d. 1631); this was already in public possession and had been housed at Ashburnham House, Westminster. These three collections were later joined by the Old Royal Library, donated by George II, and the King's Library of George III;

For many years its collections were dispersed in various buildings around central London, in places such as Bloomsbury (within the British Museum), Chancery Lane, Bayswater, and Holborn, with an interlibrary lending centre at Boston Spa, 2.5 miles (4 km) east of Wetherby in West Yorkshire (situated on Thorp Arch Trading Estate), and the newspaper library at Colindale, north-west London.


=== Move to St Pancras (1997–present) ===
Initial plans for the British Library required demolition of an integral part of Bloomsbury – a seven-acre swathe of streets immediately in front of the Museum, so that the Library could be situated directly opposite. After a long and hard-fought campaign led by Dr George Wagner, this decision was overturned and the library was instead constructed by John Laing plc on a site at Euston Road next to St Pancras railway station.
Following the closure of the Round Reading Room on 25 October 1997 the library stock began to be moved into the St Pancras building. Before the end of that year the first of eleven new reading rooms had opened and the moving of stock was continuing. From 1997 to 2009 the main collection was housed in this single new building and the collection of British and overseas newspapers was housed at Colindale. In July 2008 the Library announced that it would be moving low-use items to a new storage facility in Boston Spa in Yorkshire and that it planned to close the newspaper library at Colindale, ahead of a later move to a similar facility on the same site. From January 2009 to April 2012 over 200 km of material was moved to the Additional Storage Building and is now delivered to British Library Reading Rooms in London on request by a daily shuttle service. Construction work on the Additional Storage Building was completed in 2013 and the newspaper library at Colindale closed on 8 November 2013. The collection has now been split between the St Pancras and Boston Spa sites. The Library previously had a book storage depot in Woolwich, south-east London, which is no longer in use.

The new library was designed specially for the purpose by the architect Colin St John Wilson in collaboration with his wife MJ Long, who came up with the plan that was subsequently developed and built. Facing Euston Road is a large piazza that includes pieces of public art, such as large sculptures by Eduardo Paolozzi (a bronze statue based on William Blake's study of Isaac Newton) and Antony Gormley. It was the largest public building constructed in the United Kingdom in the 20th century.

In the middle of the building is a six-storey glass tower inspired by a similar structure in the Beinecke Library, containing the King's Library with 65,000 printed volumes along with other pamphlets, manuscripts and maps collected by King George III between 1763 and 1820. In December 2009 a new storage building at Boston Spa was opened by Rosie Winterton. The new facility, costing £26 million, has a capacity for seven million items, stored in more than 140,000 bar-coded containers and which are retrieved by robots from the 162.7 miles of temperature and humidity-controlled storage space.
The Euston Road building was Grade I listed on 1 August 2015. It has plans to open a third location in Leeds, potentially located in the Grade 1 listed Temple Works.


==== Digital archiving and Digital Library System ====
In 2012, the UK legal deposit libraries signed a memorandum of understanding to create a shared technical infrastructure implementing the Digital Library System developed by the British Library. The DLS was in anticipation of the Legal Deposit Libraries (Non-Print Works) Regulations 2013, an extension of the Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003 to include non-print electronic publications from 6 April 2013. Four storage nodes, located in London, Boston Spa, Aberystwyth, and Edinburgh, linked via a secure network in constant communication automatically replicate, self-check, and repair data. A complete crawl of every .uk domain (and other TLDs with UK based server GeoIP) has been added annually to the DLS since 2013, which also contains all of the Internet Archive's 1996–2013 .uk collection. The policy and system is based on that of the Bibliothèque nationale de France, which has crawled (via IA until 2010) the .fr domain annually (62 TBs in 2015) since 2006.
On 5 April 2013, the Library announced that it would begin saving all sites with the suffix .uk in a bid to preserve the nation's ""digital memory"" (which as of then amounted to about 4.8 million sites containing 1 billion web pages). The Library would make all the material publicly available to users by the end of 2013, and would ensure that, through technological advancements, all the material is preserved for future generations, despite the fluidity of the Internet.


==== 2023 cyber attack ====

On 28 October 2023 the British Library's entire website went down due to a cyber attack, later confirmed as a ransomware attack attributed to ransomware group Rhysida. Catalogues and ordering systems were affected, rendering the great majority of the library's collections inaccessible to readers. The library released statements saying that their services would be disrupted for several weeks, with some disruption expected to persist for several months.
As at January 2024, the British Library continued to experience technology outages as a result of the cyber-attack.  By October 2024 many of the previously inaccessible services had been restored, including remote item ordering, online learning services and online manuscripts.


== Collections ==

The British Library is a legal deposit library. In England, legal deposit can be traced back to at least 1610. The Copyright Act 1911 established the principle of the legal deposit, ensuring that the British Library and five other libraries in Great Britain and Ireland are entitled to receive a free copy of every item published or distributed in Britain. The other five libraries are: the Bodleian Library at Oxford; the University Library at Cambridge; Trinity College Library in Dublin; and the National Libraries of Scotland and Wales. The British Library is the only one that must automatically receive a copy of every item published in Britain; the others are entitled to these items, but must specifically request them from the publisher after learning that they have been or are about to be published, a task done centrally by the Agency for the Legal Deposit Libraries.
Under the terms of Irish copyright law (most recently the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000), the British Library is entitled to automatically receive a free copy of every book published in Ireland, alongside the National Library of Ireland, Trinity College Library in Dublin, the library of the University of Limerick, the library of Dublin City University and the libraries of the four constituent universities of the National University of Ireland. The Bodleian Library, Cambridge University Library, and the National Libraries of Scotland and Wales are also entitled to copies of material published in Ireland, but again must formally make requests.
The Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003 extended United Kingdom legal deposit requirements to electronic documents, such as CD-ROMs and selected websites.
The British Library Document Supply Service (BLDSS) and the Library's Document Supply Collection is based at the Library's site in Boston Spa. Collections housed in Yorkshire, comprising low-use material and the newspaper and Document Supply collections, make up around 70% of the total material the library holds.  The Library also holds the Asia, Pacific and Africa Collections (APAC) which include the India Office Records and materials in the languages of Asia and of north and north-east Africa.


=== Manuscripts ===


==== Foundation collections ====
The three foundation collections are those which were brought together to form the initial manuscript holdings of the British Museum in 1753:

Cotton manuscripts
Harley manuscripts
Sloane manuscripts


==== Other named collections ====
Other ""named"" collections of manuscripts include (but are not limited to) the following:

Arundel Manuscripts
Egerton manuscripts
King's manuscripts
Lansdowne manuscripts
Royal manuscripts
Stefan Zweig Collection
Stowe manuscripts
Yates Thompson manuscripts
Other collections, not necessarily manuscripts:

Lawrence Durrell Collection


==== Additional manuscripts ====

The Additional Manuscripts series covers manuscripts that are not part of the named collections, and contains all other manuscripts donated, purchased or bequeathed to the Library since 1756. The numbering begins at 4101, as the series was initially regarded as a continuation of the collection of Sloane manuscripts, which are numbered 1 to 4100.


=== Newspapers ===

The Library holds an almost complete collection of British and Irish newspapers since 1840. This is partly because of the legal deposit legislation of 1869, which required newspapers to supply a copy of each edition of a newspaper to the library. London editions of national daily and Sunday newspapers are complete back to 1801. In total, the collection consists of 660,000 bound volumes and 370,000 reels of microfilm containing tens of millions of newspapers with 52,000 titles on 45 km (28 mi) of shelves. From earlier dates, the collections include the Thomason Tracts, comprising 7,200 seventeenth-century newspapers, and the Burney Collection, featuring nearly 1 million pages of newspapers from the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The section also holds extensive collections of non-British newspapers, in numerous languages.
The Newspapers section was based in Colindale in North London until 2013, when the buildings, which were considered to provide inadequate storage conditions and to be beyond improvement, were closed and sold for redevelopment. The physical holdings are now divided between the sites at St Pancras (some high-use periodicals, and rare items such as the Thomason Tracts and Burney collections) and Boston Spa (the bulk of the collections, stored in a new purpose-built facility).
A significant and growing proportion of the collection is now made available to readers as surrogate facsimiles, either on microfilm, or, more recently, in digitised form. In 2010 a ten-year programme of digitisation of the newspaper archives with commercial partner DC Thomson subsidiary Brightsolid began, and the British Newspaper Archive was launched in November 2011. A dedicated newspaper reading room opened at St Pancras in April 2014, including facilities for consulting microfilmed and digital materials, and, where no surrogate exists, hard-copy material retrieved from Boston Spa.


=== Online, electronic and digital resources ===
The British Library makes a number of images of items within its collections available online. Its Online Gallery gives access to 30,000 images from various medieval books, together with a handful of exhibition-style items in a proprietary format, such as the Lindisfarne Gospels. This includes the facility to ""turn the virtual pages"" of a few documents, such as Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks. Catalogue entries for many of the illuminated manuscript collections are available online, with selected images of pages or miniatures from a growing number of them, and there is a database of significant bookbindings.
The British Library's commercial secure electronic delivery service was started in 2003 at a cost of £6 million. This offers more than 100 million items (including 280,000 journal titles, 50 million patents, 5 million reports, 476,000 US dissertations and 433,000 conference proceedings) for researchers and library patrons worldwide which were previously unavailable outside the Library because of copyright restrictions. In line with a government directive that the British Library must cover a percentage of its operating costs, a fee is charged to the user. However, this service is no longer profitable and has led to a series of restructures to try to prevent further losses.
When Google Books started, the British Library signed an agreement with Microsoft to digitise a number of books from the British Library for its Live Search Books project. This material was only available to readers in the US, and closed in May 2008. The scanned books are currently available via the British Library catalogue or Amazon.
In October 2010 the British Library launched its Management and business studies portal. This website is designed to allow digital access to management research reports, consulting reports, working papers and articles.
In November 2011, four million newspaper pages from the 18th and 19th centuries were made available online as the British Newspaper Archive. The project planned to scan up to 40 million pages over the next 10 years. The archive is free to search, but there is a charge for accessing the pages themselves.
As of 2022, Explore the British Library is the latest iteration of the online catalogue. It contains nearly 57 million records and may be used to search, view and order items from the collections or search the contents of the Library's website. The Library's electronic collections include over 40,000 ejournals, 800 databases and other electronic resources. A number of these are available for remote access to registered St Pancras Reader Pass holders.
PhD theses are available via the E-Theses Online Service (EThOS).


=== Philatelic collections ===

The British Library Philatelic Collections are held at St Pancras. The collections were established in 1891 with the donation of the Tapling collection; they steadily developed and now comprise over 25 major collections and a number of smaller ones, encompassing a wide range of disciplines. The collections include postage and revenue stamps, postal stationery, essays, proofs, covers and entries, ""cinderella stamp"" material, specimen issues, airmails, some postal history materials, official and private posts, etc., for almost all countries and periods. Approximately 80,000 items on 6,000 sheets may be viewed in 1,000 display frames; 2,400 sheets are from the Tapling Collection. All other material, which covers the whole world, is available to students and researchers.


== Facilities ==

The Library is open to everyone who has a genuine need to use its collections. Anyone with a permanent address who wishes to carry out research can apply for a Reader Pass; they are required to provide proof of signature and address.
Historically, only those wishing to use specialised material unavailable in other public or academic libraries would be given a Reader Pass. The Library has been criticised for admitting numbers of undergraduate students, who have access to their own university libraries, to the reading rooms. The Library replied that it has always admitted undergraduates as long as they have a legitimate personal, work-related or academic research purpose.
The majority of catalogue entries can be found on Explore the British Library, the Library's main catalogue, which is based on Primo. Other collections have their own catalogues, such as western manuscripts. There are eleven reading rooms at the London site and one in Yorkshire.
British Library Reader Pass holders are also able to view the Document Supply Collection in the Reading Room at the Library's site in Boston Spa in Yorkshire as well as the hard-copy newspaper collection from 29 September 2014. Now that access is available to legal deposit collection material, it is necessary for visitors to register as a Reader to use the Boston Spa Reading Room.


== Exhibitions ==

A number of books and manuscripts are on display to the public in the Sir John Ritblat Gallery which is open seven days a week at no charge. Some manuscripts in the exhibition include Beowulf, the Lindisfarne Gospels and St Cuthbert Gospel, a Gutenberg Bible, Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur (King Arthur), Captain Cook's journal, Jane Austen's History of England, Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre, Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures Under Ground, Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories, Charles Dickens's Nicholas Nickleby, Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway and a room devoted solely to Magna Carta, as well as several Qur'ans and Asian items.
In addition to the permanent exhibition, there are frequent thematic exhibitions which have covered maps, sacred texts, history of the English language, and law, including a celebration of the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta.


== Services and departments ==


=== Business and IP Centre ===
In May 2005, the British Library received a grant of £1 million from the London Development Agency to change two of its reading rooms into the Business & IP Centre. The centre was opened in March 2006. It holds a comprehensive collection of business and intellectual property (IP) material and is part of the UK's National Network of Business and IP Centres.
The collection is divided up into four main information areas: market research, company information, trade directories, and journals. It is free of charge in hard copy and online via approximately 30 subscription databases. Registered readers can access the collection and the databases. Staff are trained to guide small and medium enterprises (SME) and entrepreneurs to use the full range of resources.
There are over 50 million patent specifications from 40 countries in a collection dating back to 1855. The collection also includes official gazettes on patents, trade marks and Registered Design; law reports and other material on litigation; and information on copyright. This is available in hard copy and via online databases.
In 2018, a Human Lending Library service was established in the Business & IP Centre, allowing social entrepreneurs to receive an hour's mentoring from a high-profile business professional. This service is run in partnership with Expert Impact.


=== Document Supply Service ===
As part of its establishment in 1973, the British Library absorbed the National Lending Library for Science and Technology (NLL), based near Boston Spa in Yorkshire, which had been established in 1961. Before this, the site had housed a World War II Royal Ordnance Factory, ROF Thorp Arch, which closed in 1957. When the NLL became part of the British Library in 1973 it changed its name to the British Library Lending Division, in 1985 it was renamed as the British Library Document Supply Centre and is now known as the British Library Document Supply Service, often abbreviated as BLDSS.
BLDSS now holds 87.5 million items, including 296,000 international journal titles, 400,000 conference proceedings, 3 million monographs, 5 million official publications, and 500,000 UK and North American theses and dissertations. 12.5 million articles in the Document Supply Collection are held electronically and can be downloaded immediately.
The collection supports research and development in UK, overseas and international industry, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry. BLDSS also provides material to Higher Education institutions, students and staff and members of the public, who can order items through their public library or through the Library's BL Document Supply Service (BLDSS).
In April 2013, BLDSS launched its new online ordering and tracking system, which enables customers to search available items, view detailed availability, pricing and delivery time information, place and track orders, and manage account preferences online.


=== Sound archive ===

The British Library Sound Archive holds more than a million discs and 185,000 tapes. The collections come from all over the world and cover the entire range of recorded sound, from music, drama and literature to oral history and wildlife sounds, stretching back over more than 100 years.
It is possible to listen to recordings from the collection in selected Reading Rooms in the Library through their SoundServer and Listening and Viewing Service, which is based in the Rare Books & Music Reading Room.
In 2006, the Library launched a new online resource, British Library Sounds, which makes 50,000 of the Sound Archive's recordings available online.


=== Moving image services ===
Launched in October 2012, the British Library's moving image services provide access to nearly a million sound and moving image items onsite, supported by data for over 20 million sound and moving image recordings. The three services, which for copyright reasons can only be accessed from terminals within the Reading Rooms at St Pancras or Boston Spa, are:

BBC Pilot/Redux: A collaboration with BBC Research & Development to mirror its archive which has, since June 2007, been recording 24/7 of all of the BBC's national and some regional broadcast output. BBC Pilot includes 2.2 million catalogue records and 225,000 playable programmes, but unlike BBC Redux it does not include any broadcasts beyond 2011.
Broadcast News: Since May 2010, the British Library has been making off-air recordings of daily TV and radio news broadcasts from seventeen channels, including BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Sky News, Al-Jazeera English, NHK World, CNN, France 24, Bloomberg, Russia Today and China's CCTV News. Many of the programs come with subtitles, which can be electronically searched, greatly enhancing the value of the collection as a research tool.
Television & Radio Index for Learning & Teaching (TRILT): Produced by the British Universities Film & Video Council (BUFVC), TRILT is a database of all UK television and radio broadcasts since 2001 (and selectively back to 1995). Its 16 million records, growing by a million per year, cover every channel, broadcast and repeat.


== Other projects ==
The British Library sponsors or co-sponsors many projects of national and international significance. These include:

International Dunhuang Project
Theatre Archive Project

        Reasons for Designation
    
    
        Cosmic House , 1979-1985 by Charles Jencks with Terry Farrell Partnership, is listed at Grade I for the following principal reasons:Architectural interest:*	a built manifesto for Post-Modern architecture, in which the architectural design, decoration, colour and artwork are invested with multiple layers of meaning;
*	a resourceful plan, and a characteristically post-modernist spatial treatment incorporating inter-penetrating spaces, changes of level, diagonal vistas and shifted axes;
*	an inventive exterior design, which modulates from a formal and contextual street front to the free-style classicism of the garden elevation;
*`Jencks’s most ambitious built work, it illuminates his developing thinking and influential writings on Post-Modernism;
*`the building has been little altered since its completion.Historic interest:*	an early example of Post-Modern architecture in England, conceived by Charles Jencks, a critic and theorist widely credited with defining and fostering the movement internationally.

    

                    


        
            History
        
        
            19 Lansdowne Walk, a half-stuccoed, terraced villa in North Kensington, was purchased by Charles Jencks and Maggie Keswick in May 1978. The house forms part of terrace of three houses built in the 1840s by the builder William Reynolds and originally named Hanover Terrace Villas. The group was part of the wider development of the Ladbroke Estate to a layout of 1823 by Thomas Allason. Jencks and Keswick approached Michael Fisher of Fisher Associates to execute their own ideas for the reconfiguration and redecoration of the house. Two lasting principles were established at this stage: that the street front should be contextual in its materials and decoration; and that the garden elevation should be more spatially elaborate, with a series of stairs and terraces framing conservatories. Internally, they envisaged a semi-open plan, with space contained by anchor points such as chimneys, columns and ceiling beams. By October 1978, realising that Fisher’s office was not of sufficient size to realise their intentions, they engaged Terry Farrell, then in partnership with Nick Grimshaw. Jencks knew both from the Architectural Association (AA) and invited them to lecture there and at the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1976. From the autumn of 1978 to February 1979 Jencks, Keswick, Farrell and his project architects worked together on the design. The semi-open plan was further refined with the introduction of shifted and diagonal axes and fragmented classical forms. The stair was moved to the centre of the house, and its solar symbolism may have prompted the seasonal theme for the principal ground floor rooms. Another design issue concerned the remodelling of a C20 addition to the west of the original house to house Jencks’s architectural library above a kitchen and dining room. Anticipating problems gaining planning consent, Farrell suggested spatially compressing the addition so that its upper storey was open to a shaped roof, while stepping the floor structure up towards the street. Jencks suggested introducing a double-curved profile to the roof, an idea inspired by the use of such forms by the Austrian baroque architect Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt.The design of the rear elevation continued to be reworked until 1983, arriving at the present configuration of paired conservatory bays sharing access to a central stairway leading down to the garden. Farrell, in consultation with solar energy expert Ralph Lebens, suggested that the south-facing conservatories could generate passive solar energy which could be transferred to a heat store at the basement of the house (Jencks and Farrell 1986, p 18). The elevation was conceived by Jencks as a family of forms based on a face-like stagger and curve motif. This ‘Jencksiana’ was applied to several elements, including windows and interior fittings. Jencks and Keswick were influenced by a 1979 stay at the Schindler House in Los Angeles (of 1921-1922 by Rudolf M Schindler) where window-wall panels open onto the garden. Joe Foges, a member of Farrell’s team, suggested that the front windows of the conservatories could be lowered or raised electronically, like giant sash windows (Jencks and Farrell 1986, p 21). The design team, working with structural engineer David French, then finalised the main floor plans and refined the interior details, including the Solar Stair and the semi-circular ‘Moonwell’, a void bringing natural light to the darker area adjoining the party wall. After the main structural ‘shell’ was completed in early 1983, the fitting out and decoration of the interior proceeded to Jencks’ designs while individual elements were commissioned from artists, craftspeople and architects (noted in the Description below). The couple asked several of their architect friends to design rooms; while approaches to Robert A M Stern, Jeremy Dixon and Rem Koolhaas did not bear fruit, Michael Graves supplied designs for the living room fireplaces and Piers Gough of CZWG designed the basement Jacuzzi. Charles Jencks (b.1939) is an American architectural historian, cultural theorist and landscape designer, best known for his influential writings on Post-Modernism. Born in Baltimore, Maryland, Jencks studied English literature and architecture at Harvard University. In 1965 he moved to London, teaching at the AA while studying under the architectural historian Reyner Banham at University College, London. His 1970 doctoral thesis became the basis for ‘Modern Movements in Architecture’ (1973), which treated Modern architecture not as a single phenomenon but as a series of discontinuous movements. From this critique, and drawing upon the writings of Jane Jacobs, Robert Venturi and others, Jencks developed from around 1975 a thesis of Post-Modern architecture based upon pluralism, complexity and symbolism. This was articulated in ‘The Language of Post-Modern Architecture’ (1977), a key architectural polemic of the later C20. In 1980 Jencks was involved, with Paolo Portoghesi and others, in organising the architecture section of the Venice Biennale, a significant moment in the exposition of Post-Modern architecture. While best known as an architectural writer, critic and lecturer, Jencks has pursued a variety of design projects, including the Garagia Rotunda, Truro, Massachusetts (1976-1977) and the Elemental House, Los Angeles (1980-1982, with Buzz Yudell) and the Cosmic House. For the latter he designed a set of symbolic furniture, some of which was produced commercially by the Milanese firm Sawaya and Moroni. In 1978 Jencks married Maggie Keswick; after the Cosmic House was substantially complete the couple embarked upon the design of the Garden of Cosmic Speculation for her family home at Portrack in Dumfries, Scotland. He developed its sinuous landforms and other symbolic programmes in subsequent Scottish commissions at the Scottish Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh (1999-2002), Jupiter Artland at Kirknewton (2003-2010) and the Crawick Multiverse near Sanquhar (opened in 2015).  After Keswick’s death in 1995 Jencks co-founded Maggie’s Cancer Care Centres, for which he has designed several gardens. (Sir) Terry Farrell (b 1938) is a pre-eminent British architect and urban designer. After graduating from the University of Newcastle School of Architecture, Farrell took a Masters in Architecture and City Planning at the University of Pennsylvania, where his tutors included Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown, pioneers of Post-Modern architecture. While working for the London County Council in 1961-1962, Farrell designed the Blackwall Tunnel Ventilation Towers (1961-1964, Grade II). There he met Nicholas Grimshaw, with whom he established a partnership in 1965. Associated with the British High-Tech movement, their works include 125 Park Road, Westminster (1968-1970, Grade II) and the Herman Miller Factory, Bath (1976, Grade II). As Farrell later wrote, his collaboration with Charles Jencks on the Cosmic House ‘[set] off a train of events that would culminate in the end of my partnership with Nick Grimshaw’ (Farrell 2003, p 131). In 1980 the partners separated and established separate practices. Other notable Post-Modernist projects by the Terry Farrell Partnership include TV-am studios, Camden Lock (1981-1983); Thames Water operations centre, Fobney, Reading (1981-1982); Comyn Ching, Seven Dials (1983-1987, Grade II); Embankment Place, Charing Cross (1987-1990); Alban Gate, 125 London Wall (1988-1992) and SIS headquarters, Vauxhall (1990-1994). More recent work includes the Home Office, London (completed 2005) and the Great North Museum, Newcastle (completed 2009). Farrell established an office in Hong Kong in 1991, leading to a productive practice in Asia, projects including Beijing South Station (completed 2008).Charles Jencks did much to define and foster Post-Modern architecture, while as a practitioner Terry Farrell was responsible for some of its key works in England. Post-Modernism, a movement and a style prevalent in architecture between about 1975 and 1990, is defined in terms of its relationship with Modernism. Like Modernism, Post-Modernism is represented in philosophy, literature, design and the visual arts, and can therefore be understood as a wider cultural and intellectual formation. Post-Modern architecture is characterised by its plurality, engagement with urban context and setting, reference to older architectural traditions and use of metaphor and symbolism. As a formal language it has affinities with mannerism (unexpected exaggeration, distortions of classical scale and proportion) and the spatial sophistication of Baroque architecture. Post-Modernism accepts the technology of industrialised society but expresses it in more diverse ways than the machine imagery of the contemporary high-tech style. The origins of the style are found in the United States, notably in the work of Robert Venturi and Charles Moore which combined aspects of their country’s traditions (ranging from the C19 Shingle Style to Las Vegas) with the knowing irony of pop art. A parallel European stream combined an abstracted classicism or a revival of 1930s rationalism with renewed interest in the continental city and its building types. In England, the American and European idioms converged in the late 1970s, to produce works by architects of international significance, including James Stirling, and distinctive voices unique to Britain such as John Outram. The revival of the British economy in the 1980s found voice in office projects by Terry Farrell and others in London, while practices such as CZWG devised original yet contextual imagery for housing developments in Docklands and elsewhere.

            Mid-C19 house, remodelled in 1979-1985 by Charles Jencks with Terry Farrell Partnership.MATERIALS: the house is of load-bearing brick, partly clad in stucco with plastered and painted surfaces internally. The floors, roof structure and window frames are of timber, while internal fittings are constructed from medium density fibre (MDF) and other materials. The cylindrical stairwell and rear conservatory bays are of reinforced concrete while the garden stairway is of steel construction. There is a slate roof to the main house and that to the western addition is clad in lead.EXTERIOR: the street (north) elevation largely preserves the appearance of the original, 1840s terrace. The main house is of four storeys including basement and attics. The lower portion, openings and cornice are finished in stucco with rustication to the raised ground floor, while the first-floor is of contrasting London stock bricks. There are two bays, a narrow entrance bay to the left, from which breaks forward a wide bay which houses the principal rooms. The original Italianate stucco decoration is largely confined to the entrance portico and the principal first-floor window which has a balconette with guilloche-like balusters supported on consoles and a moulded segmental arch over the architrave. Jencks’ interventions to the north elevation include the front door and fanlight which, with its double doorknobs and applied mouldings, makes up an anthropomorphic figure. Into the fanlight is incorporated in abstract form the initials of his family. The cornice is pierced by dormer windows whose stepped and arched forms echo those of the rear elevation. The western annex, a C20 addition remodelled by Jencks, is of three storeys and three bays. Its design picks up the rusticated stucco and fenestration of the main house, while the parapet balustrade reproduces a flattened version of the guilloche motif (nicknamed ‘rabbits’ by Jencks and Keswick). The hipped roof has an ogee profile, clad in lead. It is surmounted by a small roof terrace, enclosed by a square gridded balustrade.In the side (west) elevation, the twin stacks of the 1840s house are transformed into a pair of ‘London columns’, with stepped bases and sunburst capitals. A central glazed section lights the central stair, the central portion of which is semi-circular in plan to resemble an engaged column. At first-floor level multi-paned windows have been inserted into the outer brick bays. The central windows of the western addition are ordered into a full-height bay, unified by spandrels of square tiling and steel grids framed by rusticated stucco bands. The balustrade is pierced by a dormer window with the stagger-and-curve ‘Jencksiana’ motif, crowned by a gridded openwork pediment.The garden (south) elevation is of brick and the rear windows of the main house are grouped into wide bands of stucco. The dormer windows have ‘Jencksiana’ motifs of different sizes and designs. A pair of two-storey conservatories, breaking forward, have a reinforced concrete frame, painted white. Their glazed infill and the balustrade to the roof terrace repeats the ‘Jencksiana’ forms. Flanking the conservatories, and breaking forward of them is an arched basement entrance with oversized voussoirs and a voided keystone. It is surmounted by a small roof terrace, served by a double flight, closed string stair of steel. The four ‘Jencksiana’ openings can be read as a family group, with the two dormer windows representing the children of the household; the east conservatory, the mother; and the west conservatory, the father (Jencks 1985, p 105-6). Thus the motifs become more explicitly anthropomorphic on the more private garden elevation.PLAN/INTERIORS: in general terms, the original cellular layout has been opened up to create a fluid, semi-open plan, framed by the central stair and extending out into two rear conservatories. Diagonal vistas were created by cutting through walls at certain points, while disparities between front and back elevations were resolved by the technique of shifted axes, derived from Jencks's study of C18 French architecture. The layouts are also characterised by the use of circles, arcs and ellipses.The GROUND FLOOR was designed for the reception of visitors and the entertaining of guests as well as the needs of the occupants. The principal rooms, occupying the wider bay of the C19 house and the western addition, follow a seasonal programme. This was prompted by the plan, in which the principal rooms radiate around the central Solar Stair; and by a design for a house based on the four seasons by the C18 Flemish architect Jean-François de Neufforge (Jencks and Farrell 1986, p 10-11). The entrance hall, elliptical on plan, was conceived by Jencks as a ‘cosmic oval’ and reflects his growing interest in science and cosmology. The walls comprise a series of panelled doors with double doorknobs, framed mirror glass and a moulded cornice. Some open onto cupboards while others are false. Stencil lettering of Jencks’ design describes the major themes of the house: ‘THE COSMIC LAW IS / TIME’S RHYTHM WHICH / RULES SUN & MOON / THE FOUR SEASONS TOO / GIVING HEAT & LIGHT / OVER ALL ARCHITECTURE / EGYPT & CHINA BEGIN / ARCHETYPES & READYMADES / THE FOURSQUARE MOTIF / WINDOWS ON THE WORLD / THE 5 BUILDING ARTS / IN FREE CLASSIC STYLE / TWENTY-TWO FACES / AN ECLECTIC WHOLE / OF PERSONAL SIGNS / OWLS, LILLIES, CATS / FIX A PLACE IN TIME’Above is a mural frieze by William Stok depicting historical figures from different cultures engaged in conversation, including the ancient Egyptian architect and royal physician Imhotep, Pythagoras, a Chinese poet, Hadrian, Abbot Suger, Erasmus, a Jesuit astrologer, John Donne, Borromini, Prince Hito, Thomas Jefferson and Hannah Arendt. Into the softwood floor is inlaid a series of rectangles inscribed into ovals, representing the early and sky. This geometric sequence is repeated in a series of nested domes suspended from the ceiling, which is based on domes by the C17 Italian architect Guarino Guarini. It is adjoined by a cloakroom and a WC (‘the Cosmic Loo’ in Jencks’s programme) which features an elaborately-framed mirror and mirrored ceiling.The north-facing front room, dedicated to Winter, is en suite with the rear Spring room. There are entrances to the principal stair and entrance hall and a narrow, staggered diagonal opening to the Autumn room to the west. The floorboards of Winter and Spring are painted ultramarine blue with a gloss finish, while their ceilings share a quadrant motif with a mirrored surface. Bookcases line the east wall of both rooms, their doors having double doorknobs and panes of clear glass. They mark one of the themes of the house: ‘windows on the world’ (Jencks 1985, p 151). The winter fireplace was designed by Michael Graves and executed in MDF painted to resemble red marble. It takes the abstracted form of fluted uprights carrying a lintel with a projecting square keystone. An engaged column in contrasting yellow and dark green supports a bronze bust of Hephaestus, a portrait of Eduardo Paolozzi by Celia Scott. The walls of the Winter room are painted grey against which the chimneybreast is picked out in dark blue, with the bust framed by six bronze stars. The south-facing Spring room is painted in a lighter grey. Graves also designed the Spring fireplace, which omits the projecting keystone of the Winter fireplace and is decorated with a pale yellow colour scheme. He also designed tall plinths, formed of groups of four slender pillars for three bronze busts by Penny Jencks, symbolising April, May and June. Also of Graves’s design is the stencilled abstract flower motif. Framing the conservatory are a pair of ‘London columns’, with fluted bases concealing hi-fi speakers, square shafts incorporating bookcases and flaring capitals incorporating translucent scallop lamp shades. A staggered diagonal doorway to the dining room mirrors that to the north. A sunken, semi-circular window seat occupies the projecting conservatory bay. The central window can be lowered mechanically with an electric mechanism. The bench was designed to resemble a series of terraced arcades when viewed from the garden terrace; from above, it suggests an arch with the central step in place of a dropped keystone. A central, semi-circular table is inscribed with a sundial, from which the room takes its name, ‘Sundial Arcade’. East of the Spring room is the Egyptian Room, a small study with a lower ceiling. A built-in bench has inscribed ornament representing Nile mud and pyramid forms, while the cornice is decorated with a lotus frieze. On the party wall, on axis with the Spring fireplace, is a series of nested and recessed architraves around a false door with mirror panels. This structure, which conceals service pipes, is intended to recall an Egyptian ‘false wall through which the departed looks back at the world he has left’ (Jencks 1985, p 135).The south-western portion of the ground floor is occupied by the dining room, named after Summer and painted in a yellow shade. Exposed rafters radiate out diagonally from the Solar Stair, symbolising the sun’s rays. The ceiling beams rests on twin ‘heat and light’ columns with stepped brick capitals and bases, column radiators for shafts and uplighters. To the east and west is an internal clerestorey with views to the Architectural Library above. The columns frame a curved balcony overlooking the double-height conservatory. The conservatory is painted white and lit by four pyramidal skylights let into the flat roof. Its front window can also be lowered by pressing a button. The flat balustrade is pierced with a winged sun motif. The dining room and kitchen can be divided by pulling out a row of folding doors, which are attached to a track in the floor. The doors are multi-paned and glazed with mirror glass. The kitchen is named ‘Indian Summer’ after its location mid-way between the Summer and Autumn rooms. It has a low ceiling, with exposed rafters radiating from the central stairwell. Taking its themes from Hindu and Mogul architecture, the kitchen features bulbous engaged columns and cupboard doors, a reference to the columns of the Ajanta Caves in Aurangabad, India, and surfaces are painted to simulate the pink marble of the buildings of New Delhi. Above the sink is a stepped plate rack which accommodates a narrow window through to the Solar Stair. Above is a frieze of painted wooden spoons (dubbed ‘spoonglyphs’ in a pun on ancient Greek triglyphs) which alternate with storage alcoves. The ceiling steps up from the kitchen to the Autumn room, a pantry. Both side walls have three storage units diminishing in scale towards the front wall. They are painted in a burnt Sienna hue and decorated with an Egyptian ankh motif.At the centre of the house is the Solar Stair which represents the solar year. It has 52 steps (one for each week of the year) of pre-cast concrete, cantilevered from the cylindrical stairwell structure. Openings cut through the stairwell at different points give glimpses to the adjoining rooms. Each riser has seven subdivisions to mark the days of the week. The curved mouldings to the soffit of the staircase were inspired by Inigo Jones’s Queen’s House at Greenwich. Incorporated into the ends of the steps are mirror discs bearing signs of the zodiac designed by Jencks and made by Ilinca Cantacuzino. Orbs on the three tubular aluminium hand rails represent the paths of the sun, earth and moon. At the base of the stairwell is a Black Hole mosaic by Eduardo Paolozzi. At the top of the stairwell is 'Cosmic Galaxies & Planets', an early-C21 installation of selenite and fibre-optics by Jencks. The configuration of the FIRST FLOOR broadly follows the ground floor, with the principal bedroom and Maggie Keswick’s study occupying the principal bay of the main house, and the western addition given over to an architectural library. The Architectural Library occupies the full length of the western addition and is open to the curved underside of the roof, creating a tent-like interior. The roof is painted sky blue and is supported on slender cylindrical stanchions, painted in white. The floor is covered with a baize-like green carpet. To the north are three tiered steps with side returns, intended to form a seating area for slide shows. The opposite end of the room partly encloses a roof terrace accessed via a pair of French windows. Adjoining the sides of the terrace are glazed light tables for viewing slides. They incorporate floor voids, allowing glimpsed views to the dining room below. The fitted bookshelves are designed as a village of ‘bookhouses’, made from flat panels of MDF painted with a wood grain finish. Each bookcase signifies a period of architecture, from Egyptian to Post-Modern, acting as a finding aid.  The staircase drum is ‘peeled back’ in successive layers of stucco, brick and reinforced concrete to reveal a window with a stepped sill. The ceiling above is cut away in a scalloped pattern, painted purple-blue to resemble storm-clouds, to reveal a sunburst motif of rafters radiating from the stairwell. The whole composition forms one of the more detailed face motifs in the house. The ‘Foursquare Room’, the master bedroom, is a series of variations on the motif of the square and the quadrant. The room is carpeted and the walls are painted in white and cream. A series of wooden fittings, mostly of 4×4 inch timber sections painted in white, are linked by a continuous cornice-like strip which is stencilled with a blue four square motif. An open framework of 4×4 uprights divides the room from the landing and an internal window is set into the stairwell wall. The convex stairwell form is matched by the quarter-round frame of the dressing room in the south west corner. Central to the west wall is a fireplace with an open framed surround and a low, concave bench in white painted timber. The landing is punctuated by doors decorated with applied stepped mouldings and double doorknobs. On axis with the Solar Stair is the ‘Moonwell’, a shaft of space bringing natural light from a roof light to the darker areas adjoining the party wall. This element is comparable to the light wells at Charles Moore’s house at New Haven, Connecticut (1966-1967). On the floor above, the semi-circular void is pierced by arched windows and backed by a wall of framed mirrors to give the illustration of a cylindrical space lit by a 'full moon'. The uppermost mirror is etched with a moon incorporating figures from Chinese legend by Ilinca Cantacuzino. The Moonwell opens out onto the first-floor landing with a series of lamps connected by pendant arches. To the south is a fragment of the original staircase, retained to connect the half levels of the bathroom and the dressing room above. The bathroom is decorated in bespoke blue-green glazed tiles by Jay Bonner. The stepped surround to the bath tub is echoed by similar forms suspended from the corners of the ceiling, completing a cubistic, grotto-like effect.The SECOND FLOOR, extending into the roof space, was given over to the couple’s two children and their nanny. The curved and dormers of the larger front bedroom are painted in different shades of blue while a full-height internal window in the south west corner admits borrowed light from the Solar Stair. The Jencksiana form of the dormer window is echoed by a built-in set of stepped drawers underneath, flanked by fitted wardrobes. A built-in set of wooden steps gives access to half-height galleries formed under the apex, influenced by similar children’s spaces realised by Terry Farrell at his own home. The smaller bedroom adjoining is decorated in shades of pale turquoise and cream. Integrated into its dormer window is a series is stepped niches for the display of objects. A convex fitted wardrobe is curved on plan to echo the stairwell behind and decorated with lily forms (a pun on their daughters' name, Lily). A matching set of steps leads to the half-height gallery. At the rear of the house is the nanny’s room. To the south wall is a symmetrical array of built-in furniture with wardrobes and a series of drawers that step down to accommodate the central dormer window.The BASEMENT rooms were amongst the last parts of the house to be planned. At the front is a garage, externally accessed from a ramp, with internal access to the staircase, and a self-contained flat. The side walls of the garage are lined with fitted cupboard units of standard design, fitted with double and triple doorknobs; they are thought to post-date the main phase of construction (i.e.1979-85). Attached to the front wall of the garage is an elaborate fitted dressing table and mirror originally constructed about 1976-1977 for Jencks and Keswick's previous residence at Park Walk Flat, Chelsea, and reset in its present position. It represents an early instance of the stagger and curve motif referred to by its designer as 'Jencksiana'. The self-contained flat comprises a living room, adjoining bedroom (from which it is separated by a square opening with fitted shelves), and an en suite bathroom. In the vaulted service and storage accommodation to the front are a fitted kitchen of standard design and entrance hallway. Extending out into the twin conservatories at the rear of the house are a children’s play room and a garden room. The former, conceived as a ‘room of doubles’, is highly symmetrical, the external curve of the cylindrical stairwell being mirrored in the quadrant shape of the adjacent room. The built-in furniture is decorated with abstracted forms suggesting pairs of owls and cats. Built into the rear wall of the garden room is a symmetrical, stepped structure incorporating fitted book cases. The projecting rear bay of the house contains a Jacuzzi designed by Piers Gough with Charles Jencks. The Jacuzzi tub in terrazzo and bronze is a trompe l'oeil representation of an inverted dome, loosely based on Borromini’s San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane in Rome. The stepped ceiling, clad in green tiles, is an inversion of the ‘Jencksiana’ motif. The spandrels have roundels with four season motifs, designed by Jencks and made by Ilinca Cantacuzino.Subsidiary features: the garden patio is paved with square flagstones divided into quadrants by aluminium strips. They are framed by brick paving laid in a parquet pattern incorporating flagstones.Pursuant to s. (5A) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (‘the Act’) it is declared that the fitted storage units of the garage; the fitted kitchen and bathroom of the self-contained basement flat; and all plant are not of special architectural or historic interest.

It has been listed Grade I on the National Heritage List for England since May 2018. It was designed by Charles Jencks in collaboration with other postmodern architects including Terry Farrell and Michael Graves, as his own home. The sculptors Celia Scott and Eduardo Paolozzi also participated in its development.
The existing 1840s end-of-terrace villa was initially purchased by Jencks and his wife Maggie Keswick in May 1978, and the transformation of the main structure was completed in 1983. The stucco-fronted building houses such interior features as pedimented bookshelves, a sundial window seat, and an upside-down classical dome serving as a jacuzzi. The main Solar Stair is complemented by a semi-circular 'Moonwell', which channels natural light over a darker area. The house encapsulates Jencks's theories, and there are plans for it to be converted into an archive museum, named the 'Cosmic House', which could be open to the public by appointment.
It opened to the public from 24 September 2021, as ""The Cosmic House"".

The National Gallery extension, also known as the Sainsbury Wing. Designed in 1985, developed and refined in 1986-1987, and built from 1988 to 1991 by Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown and Associates in association with Sheppard Robson Architects. 
    

                    


    
        Reasons for Designation
    
    
        The Sainsbury Wing at the National Gallery, of 1988-1991 by Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates, is listed at Grade I for the following principal reasons:Architectural interest: *	designed as an extension to Wilkins' Grade I-listed National Gallery of 1832-8, to which it is attached, to house the collection of Early Renaissance art, both of which it references;
*	in its Mannerist interpretation of classical form and symbolism and use of Post-Modern devices in its response to context; 
*	a highly individual design, achieving a balance of old and new in the display of Early Renaissance art;  
*	lack of alteration and legibility of the overarching concept. Historic interest:*	the origins and evolution of the project, and the debate that surrounded it, and in the choice of architects and style as the solution to the problem of providing a suitable extension to a prominent public building;
*	the only work in Britain by these internationally important architects and theorists, generally considered the founders of Post-Modernism;
*	with considerable experience in the design of art galleries, it is regarded as one of the highlights of their later careers.Group Value: *	with the Grade I-listed Wilkins Building to which it is attached, with Canada House (Grade II*) and with the iconic structures and statuary that form Trafalgar Square. 

    

                    


        
            History
        
        
            The Sainsbury Wing at the National Gallery is the only work in Britain by Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates (VSBA), internationally important architects and theorists, generally considered the founders of Post-Modernism. It was designed in 1985-1987, and built from 1988 to 1991 as an addition to the National Gallery. Work began in January 1988 with the Prince of Wales laying the foundation stone in March 1988.  The Queen opened the building on 9 July 1991.POST-MODERNISM: Post-Modernism can be found across philosophy, literature, art and architecture, and the term is an old one, used in painting in the 1880s and literature in the 1940s.  The term began to be used in architecture in the mid-1970s to signify a transformation of the orthodoxy of the Modern Movement that incorporated references to older architectural traditions, was more aware of setting and context, and sought enjoyment through colour and collage techniques. A clear distinction can be made between post-modernist architects, who all grew out of the Modern Movement, and traditionalists such as Quinlan Terry who had no such relationship with Modernism.  The origins of the style are found in the United States, notably in the work of Robert Venturi and Charles Moore from the mid-1960s, paying homage to all aspects of their country’s traditions. A more rigorous, classically-minded version evolved in Italy in the work of Paolo Portoghesi, Aldo Rossi and Vittorio Gregotti; in Italian-speaking Switzerland Mario Botta offered a more over-scaled version, and monumentalism was also seen in Spain. In England, the American and European idioms converged in the late 1970s, where it produced major architects of international significance, including James Stirling, and distinctive voices unique to Britain such as John Outram. The movement in architecture coincided with the revival of the British economy in the 1980s that encouraged new commercial and housing developments in areas such as Docklands.  THE NATIONAL GALLERY: the National Gallery was built to the designs of William Wilkins in 1832-1838 after the British Government acquired the art collection of John Julius Angerstein in 1824, which was originally displayed in his town house on Pall Mall. The demolition of the King’s Mews and the creation of Trafalgar Square nearby provided the perfect location for a gallery in a prominent location that was seen as accessible to all. Wilkins’ gallery was small and was progressively extended, the tight site leading, however, to the creation of the separate National Gallery for British Art (the Tate Gallery) in 1897.The site of the Sainsbury Wing was that of Hamptons and Sons, a furniture store at 8 Pall Mall East and 1-3 Dorset Street (now Whitcomb Street), built in 1869 and destroyed by incendiaries in November 1940. The National Gallery acquired the site for an extension in 1959 but thereafter concentrated its expansion plans along Orange Street to the north, and it was only in the late 1970s with acceptance that it could not take over the National Portrait Gallery, the rapid growth in museum-going, and demands that the bombsite be filled that the momentum for a new building was created.  The Conservative Government elected in 1979 was unwilling to provide public funding, and proposed instead that a developer build new galleries for the Early Renaissance collections with funding generated by a related office block. An open architect/developer competition was launched in December 1981, and eighty entries were received. Seven were shortlisted, of which the most eye-catching was by the Richard Rogers Partnership, which gained much publicity when praised by the president of the RIBA, Owen Luder, while the gallery preferred the more neutral design by Skidmore Owings Merrill (SOM). However, the public and assessors favoured an in-between scheme with curved galleries, by Ahrends, Burton and Koralek. The firm revised this to incorporate more gallery and office space, with a tower, and at a public inquiry in April 1984 the inspector found in favour of the scheme, albeit with minor amendments. However, following the Prince of Wales' adverse reaction to the scheme, it was duly refused planning permission by the Secretary of State for the Environment, Patrick Jenkin, in September 1984.  Consequently the Sainsbury family, with a long history of art patronage, stepped forward in March 1985 to sponsor a new scheme, without the need for commercial offices.  A second, invited competition was held between six practices: James Stirling, Jeremy Dixon, Piers Gough and Colquhoun & Miller representing Britain, and Harry Cobb of IM Pei and Venturi, Rauch and Scott Brown for the United States. Venturi, Rauch and Scott Brown (from 1989 Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates) who had considerable experience of building art galleries, were declared the winners in January 1986. With changing tastes in the mid-1980s and the Prince’s involvement, a classical design was almost inevitable, but the firms involved represented the strongest English-speaking forces in Post-Modernism at that time. The building won an AIA Honor Award in 1992.THE ARCHITECTS: Robert Venturi (1925- ) studied at Princeton and at the American Academy in Rome, and Charles Saumarez Smith suggests that his knowledge of Italian church interiors impressed the competition assessors (The National Gallery, a Short History, 2009, p156). He began his career working for Eero Saarinen and Louis Kahn while designing a house for his mother, the Vanna Venturi House in Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, completed in 1964, which is widely considered the first post-modern building, combining elements of a traditional settlers’ cottage with a broken pediment and modern strip windows. Other houses and small buildings followed in Pennsylvania when he formed his own practice in about 1963, which he combined with teaching at the University of Pennsylvania alongside Kahn. He came to greater prominence with a book, Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture (1966), which called for a return to historical styles, symbolism and context in architecture. He thus placed himself in the vanguard of what became Post-Modernism.  At the University of Pennsylvania he met Denise Scott Brown (1931- , née Lakofski), born in Zambia and trained in South Africa and London, who settled in Philadelphia following the death of her first husband, Robert Scott Brown, in 1959. She went on to teach in Los Angeles, whence in 1967 she invited Venturi to make an architectural and planning study of Las Vegas, which led to their marriage that year and to a second important book, Learning from Las Vegas, published in 1972 with Steve Izenour. The two went on to design a large number of buildings, separately and together, with Scott Brown taking the lead on the practice’s extensive planning work, mostly for city centres and universities. Their enormous output over a fifty-year career includes large numbers of houses in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, prestigious university buildings and art galleries, including Seattle (also completed 1991) and the Museum of Contemporary Art in San Diego, California (1996). They have worked very little outside the United States, although they designed the Provincial Capitol Building in Toulouse, France (local government headquarters of 1999).  While most projects are jointly credited, the Congregation Beth El Synagogue is by Scott Brown (2007) and the Episcopal Academy Chapel by Venturi (2008), both in Pennsylvania. Although they will perhaps be best-remembered as theorists and for Venturi’s early buildings that first defined Post-Modernism in the 1960s, their influence is traceable across a vast swathe of contemporary architectural practice. The Sainsbury Wing is one of the highlights of their later career. VSBA is unusual among American designers of the 1980s to 1990s in that almost all its work is outside the commercial sector.  Venturi retired in 2012 but Scott Brown continues to run the practice. They jointly won the American Institute of Architects’ Gold Medal in 2016, ‘for their built projects as well as literature that set the stage for Post-Modernism and nearly every other formal evolution in architecture’, cited in (www.archdaily.com/769194/spotlight-robert-venturi-and-denise-scott-brown, accessed 6 October 2017).

        
        
            Details
        
        
            The National Gallery extension, also known as the Sainsbury Wing. Designed in competition in 1985, developed and refined in 1986-1987, and built from 1988 to 1991 by Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown and Associates (Venturi, Rauch and Scott Brown to 1989) in association with Sheppard Robson Architects, and with David Vaughan directing the project team. Structural and service engineers Ove Arup and Partners, with Jaros Baum and Bolles; lighting consultants Jules Fisher and Paul Marantz; acoustics by Arup Acoustics; contractors Sir Robert McAlpine; steel railings, balustrades and gates by Capricorn of London.  MATERIALS AND STRUCTURE: a reinforced concrete frame rests on bored piles and an exterior piled wall, with a deep basement, and with a steel-framed and timber roof structure, which is largely glazed. The cladding is of Portland stone, buff brick and glass, with granite plinths and concrete panel soffits. Window units and glazed walls are in powder-coated aluminium frames, the glazed wall in dark grey with chunky, squared mouldings. The interior is clad in Chamesson limestone and render with grey Florentine sandstone (pietra serena) in the galleries, and has Cumbrian slate or oak floors, and oak fixtures and fittings. PLAN: it has a wedge-shaped footprint with an extension linking it to Wilkins’ galleries by a bridge in the form of a glazed drum raised over a public pedestrian thoroughfare. Laid out on five principal levels, it contains basement galleries and a cinema for temporary exhibitions, beneath a 350-seat lecture theatre; a ground-floor entrance, shop and visitor facilities; a mezzanine restaurant, coffee bar, conference rooms and information centre; and first-floor galleries on the same level as those by Wilkins. The *lower levels also have large areas for storage, loading bays and garaging, accessed from Whitcomb Street. Above the galleries are two levels of *plant.  The levels are connected by, and the plan arranged around, a monumental staircase on the eastern side of the building, that extends from the ground floor to first floor level and separately from ground floor to basement levels, with a core of lifts behind it. Three lines of galleries are set off the skewed main axis, the central one an enfilade, the others with some doorways set to one side to interrupt the vistas. Venturi believed that traditional galleries of modest size best suited the Early Renaissance collection, where many pieces are quite small.EXTERIOR: the gallery steps forward of the main building, with different treatments to each façade. ‘The new building is designed to be a reflection of and an extension to its context’ therefore it presents a different face at each of its edges’ (Zodiac, no 6, 1991, p 93).The building has a skin of Portland stone with pilasters that repeat the details of those by Wilkins on his frontage and create a sympathetic visual link with Canada House opposite. Venturi was inspired by oblique views of Wilkins’s building, where the pilasters also appear to come together. The architects were keen to show that their pilasters were contextual and not structural, with the stone skin also featuring blind windows in increasingly minimal mouldings as the columns become more spaced out.  The canted but slightly curved Trafalgar Square and Pall Mall East elevation, faced in ashlar, has grouped giant order pilasters on tall bases at the angles of the building, with a fluted pilaster between the entrance openings. The classical columns give way to Art Deco inspired capitals and an increasingly simple order, which is reduced to small metal columns away from the Wilkins front. It has small blind openings in moulded architraves at high level, and a large full-height window, with a crisply-cut transom, lighting the restaurant overlooking Pall Mall East. The parapet continues above both elevations, with a pierced balustrade at the eastern junction. The entrance is set behind unmoulded flat-headed openings that pierce the outer skin, some on the angle, protected by steel gates and railings the considerable height of the pilaster bases. On Pall Mall East these are framed by colourful Art Deco columns, a theme which continues to Whitcomb Street. The entrance is a series of offset geometrical forms. It has an inner glazed screen wall with a monumental frame into which paired oak doors and revolves are set in square openings, with the restaurant projecting above them. The entrance is faced with Portland stone panels that extend to a curved alcove at the southern end. The ceiling is incised in a geometric pattern, again on a large scale. Flooring is of stone and granite. To the west of the entrance the name THE NATIONAL GALLERY / SAINSBURY WING is inscribed in stone. The Jubilee Walk elevation has a glazed curtain wall that rises in stages following the stair above a flush ashlar base. To the north of the linking drum it is a predominantly blind elevation, pierced at high level by vents for the plant. A shallow, open dome supported on Portland stone columns shields the pedestrian Jubilee Walk. On each elevation it has a curved window with fixed panes in a moulded architrave in early C19 tradition, lighting the link. The drum is clad in ashlar panels, with a pronounced moulded storey band and a parapet set back behind a cornice. At street level the drum has plain, square-headed openings and open panels above, resembling overlights. At each side, openings butt hard against the adjacent buildings or frame the Wilkins building windows. The soffit of the drum is incised concrete or plaster. It has a granite floor which also extends via steps into the public domain beyond footprint of the drum. The Whitcomb Street and St Martins Street elevations rise as sheer walls, deliberately simple, clad in buff brick in Flemish bond above an ashlar base which on Whitcomb Street is moulded, continuing the theme from the pilasters. Shop windows with a central Art Deco column, a side entrance and a blind bay are set back in rectangular openings, one cutting into the corner with Pall Mall East. Above the shop windows are pairs of deep-set windows in rectangular openings serving the conference rooms, while the brickwork above is enlivened with vertical moulded strips aligned with the bays. The glazed roofs over the galleries are visible but set back behind the flush, brick parapet. Punched into the north-west corner are two small windows above a set-back entrance. Access for vehicles has steel doors and windows, likened to the stage door and ‘get in’ found at the back of a theatre (Zodiac, op cit, p 93). The rear elevation is dominated by the name THE / NATIONAL / GALLERY carved in stone in over-sized lettering, and included at the request of the Westminster City Council. The use of large lettering, known as supergraphics, is a feature of Post-Modernism. At ground level is a large inscribed granite panel set in an ashlar surround describing the history of the site as royal mews, its use by Hamptons and Sons and the Sainsbury bequest. The gallery roofs, geometrical forms in two parallel ranges, aligned roughly north-south, and intended to be visible from below, have hipped glazed superstructures and panelled or glazed flanks. 
   
INTERIOR: throughout, the tone is one of subdued greys, redolent of the Italian Renaissance, with limestone and rendered walls, and architectural dressings in darker Florentine ‘pietra serena’, with occasional brightly coloured Art Deco details and with oak joinery.  The entrance hall is low and relatively dark in contrast to the exterior, designed to suggest the crypt of an Italian church, or basement level of a Palladian villa. Fat drum piers with simple incised bases in grey stone support a deep coffered ceiling with built-in lighting. The stairway is faced in large, widely spaced stone blocks, resembling giant rustication. The shop has a glazed screen wall framed by paired Art Deco shafts. The floor of the entrance hall is of grey patterned slate. A monumental staircase rises against the eastern wall, planned by Venturi and Scott Brown to cope with the large crowds attending the National Gallery by the 1980s, with Venturi likening the potential congestion to that of a sports stadium. Broad, unimpeded steps widen towards the top and its glazed side wall provides a visual link with Trafalgar Square, the Wilkins building and the pedestrian way between the buildings at street level. Window units have deep square sectioned frames and the steel framing of the curtain wall continues as arches over the stairwell. The internal wall of the stairs is of stone ashlar with classically proportioned windows of six over four panes in plain openings, as if it were the external wall of an older building that has been cut into to make entrances on the various levels, approached by a stair suggestive of an Italian 'cortile' that in this case includes Jubilee Walk and is defined by the west wall of the Wilkins building and the interior wall of the Sainsbury Wing stairway (BD 2011, p 16). On the wall is a monumental frieze, inscribed with the names of Italian Renaissance artists, by the letter carver Michael Harvey.Opening off it at mezzanine level is a foyer leading to the restaurant, from which the glazed screen wall overlooks the entrance. Drum structural piers are again expressed in the lower inner section while the taller front section has a top-lit ceiling. Mounted on the internal wall is the painting Crivelli’s Garden (the Visitation) of 1990-1991, by Paula Rego, the theme deriving from the Early Renaissance collection in the gallery above. It was commissioned when Rego became the first National Gallery Associate Artist.  To the side and rear are a series of conference rooms, including the former Micro Gallery computer information room, leading off a curving corridor, where panelled doors, architraves and dados are again in oak. *The interior of these rooms is not of  special interest. The sixteen galleries were specifically designed for the relatively small works of the Early Renaissance. Paired, engaged columns or columns in antis, and essentially Tuscan in character, frame the lobby and principal entrance at the head of the stairs. Here and in the galleries columns and skirtings are in ‘pietra serena’ while floors are principally of oak and internal window architraves and seats are in timber. The galleries are laid out in three ranges, with the central, tallest range laid out in an enfilade, reminiscent of Sir John Soane’s Dulwich Picture Gallery, while doorways in the side galleries are offset providing oblique views across the width of the gallery space. The central galleries have tall arched openings, some framed by quarter columns, while smaller openings have square-headed moulded architraves. The openings create a false perspective as their width declines along the main axis and the link with the Wilkins building. The galleries are top-lit, with some side light admitted from the internal windows on the stairwell, while they also offer slanted views towards Trafalgar Square. The ceilings rake inwards above a simplified cornice, and the galleries are lit by clerestorey glazing of small-paned, timber, fixed lights, and in the smaller end galleries by flat, glazed ceilings, all of which are contained within the glazed roofspace above. The calm plastered finishes owe something to the post-war work of Franco Albini and Carlo Scarpa in Italy, while the whole experience is designed to emulate the experience of Italian galleries in converted complexes such as the Sant’ Agostino Museum in Genoa. Scott Brown noted ‘The new spaces are grand but less so than those of Wilkins, and their sequences contain no violent jumps of scale. They wear their history lightly, suggesting that underneath is a modern gallery with non-structural walls. While planning we asked: ""What allowed palazzos to start as family homes and convert to public institutions, and how do they manage the phalanxes that throng European museums on Sundays?"" And we designed concourse-like main spaces to take major crowds, with side rooms to provide a more intimate, overflow space, and alternative routes when the large galleries are full. (Building Design, 22 July 2011, pp16-17).Monumental stairs with a deep moulded cornice descend to the rear of the hall, again with a foyer at a half-landing giving access to the theatre. The lobby is lined in oak panelling, with built-in seats and has a geometrical steel balustrade overlooking the stairs. The theatre has raked seating for 340 people. It has slender internal piers, front and rear, with incised bases, and the walls are lined in plasterboard with a facetted acoustic finish. The seats*, audio* and lighting equipment* are not of special interest. At lowest level is the temporary exhibition space of about 500 square metres divided into six galleries, reached by monumental doorways from a circular foyer with a slate floor. Beyond the monumental doorways, the temporary exhibition space* is designed to be flexibly laid out and is not of special interest. The following are not of special interest. Service*, delivery* and storage* areas beyond the public domain, which have wholly utilitarian painted blockwork walls* and concrete floors*, and masonry stairs* with steel balustrades*. Two levels of plant* above and to the north of the main galleries and within the rear section of the building. Service cores* and other plant*, kitchens*, restaurant bar front* and furniture*, audio* and visual equipment* and lighting* in the theatre and cinema, cloakrooms* and WCs*, and temporary fixtures* and fittings* such as front desks are also excluded. * Pursuant to s1 (5A) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (‘the Act’) it is declared that these aforementioned features are not of special architectural or historic interest.
