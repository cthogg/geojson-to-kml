1. Need to check House Of St Barnabas 1066753. The summary is too architecture focused. Should get a prompt to get it's history too.
2. Add filters of the Grades and blue plaque entries.
3. Get all Grade II\* buildings in a smaller area.
4. Get all wiki map details too.
5. Get blue plaques on it as well.
6. Get cheaper audio => perhaps from Amazon Polly or Google TTS or Unreal Speech. Elevenlabs is the best but very expensive.
7. In the AI summary, link to not the list entry but the placeId.
8. Make an easier way to get al of the points of interest in a particular location. Using the bounding boxes.
