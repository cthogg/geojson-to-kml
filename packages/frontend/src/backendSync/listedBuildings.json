Architect: Cecil Masey (1881-1960) with the interiors by Theodore Komisarjevsky (1882-1954). Stone frontage, brick retaining walls to steel frame. Roof not seen. Cinema with single balcony, now with small screens set underneath balcony, and set behind deep foyer with sbops to either side.\n\nEXTERIOR: two storey rendered facade in Spanish Baroque style; pantiled low-pitched roof to the eaves on the wings. The roof is not visible on the central foyer block, which is higher than the wings. The left wing is of four bays and the right is of one bay. The central block advances slightly, twice, with a tripartite window having engaged spiral columns (surmounted by composite capitals and urns) and triple-arched and cusped Spanish baroque heads. There is a cantilevered canopy over the entrance. Coved cornice to outer bays. Glazing bars of metal creating square panes, except for elaborate Moderne glazing in the tops of the windows in the foyer block and lunettes in the windows in the wings. Late 20th century shop fronts to ground floor, arched paired windows to upper floor with spiral columns. The left return wall is also rendered and has exit doors and smaller windows for stairs etc. Under the right wing is a carriageway. To the right of the main entrance is an exit door from the public house on the first floor. Rear walls in stock brick. Two steps up to original entrance doors.\n\nINTERIOR: an outer lobby leads into a rich Ionic pilastered double-height foyer (there was previously a second set of doors separating the two spaces). Between the pilasters are six mirrors with arched- heads and shaped aprons. Full entablature and fielded ceiling. At the end, central stairs descend to a lower foyer and the former stalls level, while flanking flights ascend first to a landing running the full width of the foyer and then up to a large transverse balcony foyer with a fielded segmental barrel ceiling. All stairs in Travertine. The walls of this inner foyer are divided into bays by engaged half-columns and alternating bays containing arch-headed pier-glasses over console tables. Two Art Deco ventilation grills in the ceiling. Eleven French-style chandeliers in the foyer areas. Original furniture comprising four upholstered wing chairs and three arm-chairs. Behind steps at each end are twin door-cases (doors removed) into lobbies from which the balcony is accessed by short flights to entrances in the sides of the auditorium. Large and elaborate double-height auditorium in the Moorish style. Superimposed proscenium, with Moorish fretwork on the first three coves, to accommodate cove lighting. Dado running forward from the proscenium. Ante-proscenium splay with' Maqarnas' or stalactite-work above highly ornamented grills. Side walls with larger Islamic arches incorporating more stalactite-work (enclosing two smaller arches), areas of fluting and horseshoe arches over the balcony entrances. The latter have splayed voussoirs, ornamented tympana, cusping, fluting and flanked by pilasters enlivened by low-relief Moorish decoration. Ceiling of interlacing mouldings with a star-burst centre. The sides of the rear balcony have been brought in and the ceiling rises into a cove figured with lattice decoration. More quasi-Islamic decoration can be seen in the ventilation grills on the ceiling. Serpentine balcony front. The area under the balcony is subdivided making two small auditoria but the original coffered ceiling is still visible. Stage with original tableau curtains. Original suspended light fittings. On the first floor above the entrance lobby and extending down the long wing on the front of the building, is an area which was originally a cafe and is now a public house; steps leading to its former internal entrance can be seen in the left wall of the foyer. In the cafe, vestiges of the original decoration still survives. The Christie organ also survives and is in playable condition. One console, with Saracen decoration, is mounted on a trolley and can be wheeled on to the stage. The other one, now disused and partly dismembered, is beneath the apron stage. The organ chambers are in the roof over the auditorium and are positioned above and slightly forward of the proscenium.\n\nANALYSIS: an important example of the large and elaborate cinemas built by Sidney Bernstein between 1930 and 1939, generally in artisan districts where such escapist palaces of entertainment would be most popular. The exterior is largely original, while internally, most of the 1930 appearance survives. It is one of very few cinemas (in fact buildings of any type), designed in the Moorish style in Britain. There is the added interest of the organ, with a unique console. The ABC is the oldest surviving of the cinemas designed by Komisarjevsky in London.\n\nListing NGR: TQ3724389311 Legacy\n\nThe contents of this record have been generated from a legacy data system.\n\nLegacy System number: 206901 Legacy System: LBS\n\nSources\n\nBooks and journals Eyles, A, The Granada Theatres, (1998) Gray, R, Cinemas in Britain: One Hundred Years of Cinema Architecture, (1996), 74, 77 Webb, M, Greater London's Suburban Cinemas 1946-1986, (1986), 88",
    "wikipediaText": "Walthamstow Granada (previously known as Mirth, Marvel & Maud Granada/EMD, Granada Cinema, EMD Cinema, MGM Cinema and ABC Cinema) is a Grade II* listed building housing a pub, cinema and cultural centre in Walthamstow, London. The building is famous for having been frequented by Alfred Hitchcock during its time as a cinema. It was built on a site where films were shown as early as 1896.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1930 Granada plc built a 2,697 seat cinema, opened as The Granada.  The building featured exteriors by Cecil Masey and interior decorations by Theodore Komisarjevsky.\nIn later years, as a result of changes in the building's ownership, the cinema was variously known as MGM, ABC, and EMD cinema. Although never completely renovated after the 1970s, at the time of its closure as a cinema in December 2003, it was the only cinema to have an original working Christie Organ still in place at the cinema where it was originally installed.\nOften used as a concert venue, the Granada Cinema in Hoe Street, Walthamstow, held a concert by the Beatles on 24 May 1963. Other famous musical acts to have performed there include John Coltrane, Little Richard, Gene Vincent, Jerry Lee Lewis, Alex Paterson and Buddy Holly,\n\n\n== Campaign to save building and cinema ==\n\nThe cinema closed in 2003 and was purchased by Universal Church of the Kingdom of God (UCKG) with the intention of converting the building into a church.\nMany members of the local community opposed and successfully campaigned against these plans. Comedian and presenter Griff Rhys Jones, actor Paul McGann and writer Alain de Botton are among the famous names to have backed local residents in asking the local authority to stop plans to convert the building into a church. The Waltham Forest Film Society became the focal point for local campaigners. UCKG failed to gain planning permission to convert the building from Waltham Forest Council and later from the then Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles.\n\n\n== Reopening of building 2015 ==\nIn 2014, UCKG sold the cinema to pub company Antic who reopened the building under the new name of Mirth, Marvel and Maud.\nIn May 2019, Waltham Forest Council purchased the building from Antic. Waltham Forest Council and Soho Theatre have teamed up to secure the future of the former Granada/EMD, which will operate a new local theatre with a national profile as part of the legacy of Waltham Forest's year as the first London Borough of Culture.\nSoho Theatre will operate the building as a new cultural venue for North East London. The 950-seat rejuvenated venue will operate as a local theatre with a national profile, presenting the biggest names in comedy plus theatre, performance, music, pantomime and community and education programmes.\nRenovation of the site is being carried out by Willmott Dixon Interiors and is estimated to take around three years to complete, and initial plans suggest that events could be held on the site before the project is complete. A fund of Â£17million has been set aside for the work, which commenced in May 2020.\n\n\n== References =="

    "wikipediaText": "The Church of Christ the King belongs to Catholic Apostolic Church trustees; it is in Gordon Square, Bloomsbury, London. It adjoins Dr Williams's Library and is within sight of University College London. The church is used by the Anglican mission Euston Church for Sunday services and its English Chapel, at its east end, by Forward in Faith for weekday services. It has been a Grade I listed building since 10 June 1954, one of 129 such Christian buildings in London.\n\n\n== Construction and design ==\n\nEarly English Neo-Gothic in style and cruciform in plan, the church was built by Raphael Brandon between 1850 and 1854 (with Brandon's interior designed in 1853) for the  Catholic Apostolic Church (also known as \"Irvingites\").  It is built of Bath stone, with a tiled roof. The structure is incomplete, lacking two bays on its liturgical west side (which prevented the construction of a planned faÃ§ade â the west end remains unfinished, in brick apart from entrance in stone) and (like Westminster Abbey) a crossing tower (including a 150 ft spire â the tower base that was built has mostly blind arcading).  Its cruciform plan is made up of a nave with full triforium and clerestory, side aisles, sanctuary and Lady Chapel.  All of the church's exterior corners have octagonal corner turrets with gabled niches and terminating in spires with gablets. The faÃ§ade has pinnacled buttresses and corbelled parapets.\nThe main entrance is at the east end, from Gordon Street, through a gabled porch with angle buttresses (with mouldings, a pointed-arch door and a two-light and oculus plate tracery window above the door) which links onto the Lady Chapel via an octagonal turret and two-light room.  (There is also a north side entrance approached by a cloister walk from the porch.)\nThe five-bay nave (only 13 feet lower than that of Westminster Abbey) has a gabled east facade with three large lancet windows below five smaller ones â on the inside, it has a timber hammer beam roof with angels and central bosses of snowflake design, as well as a double-arcaded triforium.  It also contains a cathedra for its 'angel' (roughly equivalent to bishop) of the Catholic Apostolic Church.\nThe crossing is made up of roll-moulded arches on clustered columns.  The transepts are gabled, with two layers of three lancets below a rose window.  The south transept's windows (the originals) are the most notable â the lancets have Christ in Majesty with ranks of saints, apostles and angels and earth below, whilst its rose window is by Archibald Keightley Nicholson and has a dove in the centre surrounded by musician angels and cherubim and seraphim.\nThe church's three-bay sanctuary has a roof with stone rib-vaulting and foliated bosses, along with a sanctuary lamp by Augustus Pugin. The three-bay Lady Chapel (formerly the English Chapel) is beyond this sanctuary, separated from it by a screen behind the high altar with open traceried window to the chapel.  The chapel itself has a richly painted timber roof and stone angel along with an east facade with arcaded lancet windows below a small rose window and gable, along with gabled and pinnacled buttresses.\nAnnette Peach, in her entry for Raphael Brandon in the Dictionary of National Biography, writes:\n\"The Catholic Apostolic Church in Gordon Square, London, was built between 1850 and 1854 and, though reproducing features recorded by the Brandon brothers in their scholarly works, this extremely large church was criticized by a contemporary for its lack of originality of design. Recent scholars, however, have drawn attention to the combination of 13th- and 15th-century Gothic precedents in its design, which offer a tangible record of the Brandon brothers' study of ecclesiastical architecture.\"\nThe church was designated a Grade I listed building on 10 June 1954.\nIn 1853, a fine organ was erected by Gray and Davison. It was a three manuals organ with pedals, containing 13 stops on the Great-organ, 12 stops on the Swell-organ, 10 stops on the Choir-organ and 8 on the pedal. In total there were 6 couplers. A specification of the organ as it now is can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register. One of the first organists was Edmund Hart Turpin. In 1903 a sub bass 16 ft was added to the choir-organ.\n\n\n== University Church ==\nFrom 1963 to 1994, it was known as the University Church of Christ the King and served the Anglican Chaplaincy to the Universities and Colleges of the Diocese of London.  In practice, it was a worship centre for students living in the university halls nearby, but was also used occasionally for London-wide events, with a very strong emphasis on music in worship (under the successive musical directorships of Ian Hall, Alan Wilson and Simon Over).\nThis new role was begun with a morning Eucharist at which the Bishop of London, the Right Reverend Robert Stopford, celebrated and an Evensong with the former Bishop of London, J. W. C. Wand, preaching), both on 6 October 1963.  During this period, a Thanksgiving Eucharist was celebrated on 27 November 1988 for the 25th anniversary of this role, with the Right Reverend Michael Marshall preaching and, on 6 December 1983, the memorial service for Nikolaus Pevsner was held here.\nThe last Chaplaincy Sunday service was held on 28 June 1992, but a weekday Eucharist continued to be celebrated in the English Chapel. The last chaplaincy service was conducted on Ash Wednesday (16 February) 1994 by the Reverend Alan Walker of the University of Westminster; The Diocese surrendered its lease on the church to the Trustees on 30 June. A popular student venue, the Crypt CafÃ©, ran in the basement for several years until that date.\n\n\n== Euston Church ==\nEuston Church, a Church of England Bishop's Mission Order plant from St Helen's Church, Bishopsgate, started meeting in the church from September 2015, with services  at 11am, 3pm and 5pm.\n\n\n== Forward in Faith ==\nThe Lady Chapel / English Chapel at the east end of the Church is used by the Anglican Forward in Faith movement. Mass is celebrated on each weekday at 12.30pm.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSite remembering the Anglican university chaplaincy formerly based at the church\nMystery Worshipper report from Ship of Fools\nLetter of John Betjeman on the church\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nCamden.gov.uk â Listing details"

    "wikipediaText": "The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) is a public research university in Bloomsbury, central London, and a member institution of the University of London that specialises in public health and tropical medicine. The institution was founded in 1899 by Sir Patrick Manson, after a donation from the Indian Parsi philanthropist B. D. Petit.\nThe annual income of the institution for 2021â22 was Â£262.0 million, of which Â£175.3 million was from research grants and contracts, with expenditures totalling Â£291.6 million during the same period. The university has one of the largest endowment per student in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins (1899â1913) ===\n\nThe school was founded on October 2, 1899, by Sir Patrick Manson as the London School of Tropical Medicine after the Parsi philanthropist Bomanjee Dinshaw Petit made a donation of Â£6,666.\nIt was initially located at the Albert Dock Seamen's Hospital in the London Docklands. Just prior to this teaching in tropical medicine had been commenced in 1899 at the Extramural school at Edinburgh and even earlier at London's Livingstone College founded in 1893. Before giving lectures at St George's Hospital, London, in 1895, Livingstone College afforded Manson his first opportunity to teach courses in tropical medicine. Manson's early career was as a physician in the Far East. On his return to London, he was appointed Medical Advisor to the Colonial Office. He strongly believed that physicians should be trained in tropical medicine to treat British colonial administrators and others working throughout Britain's tropical empire. He also encouraged and mentored Ronald Ross during this period to uncover the correct etiology of malaria, which Ross subsequently discovered in 1897, winning the Nobel Prize for his efforts. The original school was established as part of the Seamen's Hospital Society.\nIn 1902, the benefactor Petit wrote the following about the institution in a letter to Sir Francis Lovell (Dean of the school), quoted in The Times. \n\nThis institution, whilst according ample scope to students of diseases that well nigh devastate the East, will be the means of bringing the Western and Eastern minds together to afford help to the suffering East, and thus cementing that union of hearts.\nAmong the school's early achievements were discoveries by George Carmichael Low, who proved filariasis is spread by mosquito bites, and Aldo Castellani, who discovered trypanosomes in the cerebral fluid of those affected by sleeping sickness. Experiments were also conducted by the school's faculty which provided proof that mosquitoes act as the vector in the spread of malaria.\n\n\n=== World Wars (1914â1945) ===\nDuring World War I, many of the faculty were conscripted into the army where they often continued to treat or research tropical diseases with the aim of protecting the health of the troops fighting in the Middle Eastern and African campaigns. Meanwhile, enough faculty remained at the school to continue its operations, although enrollment drastically fell during the war. The remaining faculty contributed to the war effort nonetheless by becoming increasingly involved in treating soldiers with dysentery, malaria, and other tropical diseases after their return from overseas. On the night of January 19, 1917, a TNT explosion from a nearby munition depot damaged the school and hospital, further complicating the school's operations. The school's wartime contributions were acknowledged on October 10, 1917, by a surprise visit from King George V and in 1918 by a visit from Queen Mary, Prince Edward, and Princess Mary.\n\nAs a result of the war, the school expected an increase in the amount of patients with tropical diseases and so a resolution was proposed to move the school to Central London to improve upon the school's isolated location. Consequently, the school moved, together with the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, to Endsleigh Gardens in central London, taking over a former hotel which had been used as a hospital for officers during the First World War. The building was officially opened by George VI, then Duke of York, on 11 November 1920. In 1921 the Athlone Committee recommended the creation of an institute of state medicine, which built on a proposal by the Rockefeller Foundation to develop a London-based institution that would lead the world in the promotion of public health and tropical medicine. This enlarged school, now named the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, was granted its Royal Charter in 1924. The school moved to the current building in 1929.\nThe school remained at its location in London during World War II despite the risk of bombings and an offer for accommodation by Queens' College, Cambridge. The number of students and staff fell as a result of the war, with some staff being called upon for military service. After 1941 and continuing until the end of the war, regular instruction ceased and the school instead started providing short courses in tropical medicine to nurses and doctors of the Allied Forces. On 10 May 1941, a bomb struck the building and caused a fire which was only put out the following morning due to a lack of firemen. Only four people were present at the time and remained unharmed, however, around a sixth of the building was damaged, with particularly the side facing Malet Street sustaining extensive damage. Although the damage was only fully repaired seven years later, teaching of short courses resumed the Monday after the bombing.\n\n\n=== Post-war period (1946â1960) ===\nThe healthcare environment changed in the wake of the war, both nationally and internationally, with the establishment of the National Health Service and the World Health Organization. The Chief Medical Officer and former Dean of LSHTM, Sir Wilson Jameson, played a critical role in the establishment of both.\nLSHTM served a crucial role in reshaping scientific research and public health in the post-war period. Sir Austin Bradford Hill, a professor of Medical Statistics at the school, was the statistician on the Medical Research Council Streptomycin in Tuberculosis Trials Committee and their 1948 study evaluating the use of streptomycin in treating tuberculosis, which is generally accepted as the first randomized controlled trial to have been conducted. Two years later Bradford Hill and Sir Richard Doll, a member of the MRC Statistical Research Unit based at LSHTM, were the first to demonstrate the association between cigarette smoking and lung cancer. They also set up the well-known British Doctors Study to provide evidence for a causal relationship. In 1951, alumnus Max Theiler was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for his discoveries concerning yellow fever and how to combat it\". George Macdonald, professor of tropical hygiene and director of the Ross Institute at LSHTM, was the first to propose the basic reproduction number (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          R\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R_{0}}\n  \n) in his 1952 study of malaria, which remains a key statistic in the study of infectious diseases to this day. The following year, alumnus Jerry Morris was the first to establish the role of physical exercise in preventing heart disease. Richard Doll established the connection between asbestos and lung cancer in 1955, while two Readers at the school established the connection between air pollution and respiratory diseases in 1958.\n\n\n=== End of the 20th century (1961â1999) ===\nThe university went through various changes during the latter part of the 20th century. In 1962 it acquired its first electronic computer in a collaboration with Birkbeck College, while a year later it built insectaries in its vault with financial support from the Wellcome Trust. Due to the school's need for work with live insects, the insectaries were thought to have housed the largest mosquito farm in the world. In the meantime the school closed its library and expanded the Keppel Street building to increase research and teaching space. Once completed in 1967, the modernised parts were officially opened by Princess Alexandra. In the final years of the millennium, the school launched its first distance learning programmes to an initial enrollment of 149 students for the 1998/1999 cohort.\nThe faculty of the school continued to make significant contributions to scientific research and public health. This included further work by Austin Bradford Hill, who postulated the Bradford Hill criteria in 1965 to determine causality. The criteria have since been widely used in public health research. LSHTM also started the long-running Whitehall Study in 1967 which found significant social inequalities in health in the 18,000 participants from the UK Civil Service. The Black Report published in 1980, for which alumnus Jerry Morris was one of the contributors, found similar inequalities. In 1972, the first case of lassa fever in the U.K. was diagnosed at the school. The school's faculty were also involved in research projects to advance understanding and prevention of various infectious diseases around this time, such as the Karongo Prevention Study in Malawi. Professors at the university developed the sisterhood method in 1989, thereby increasing the accuracy of maternal mortality data from low-income countries and developing a method which is still recommended by the WHO to this day. The National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles was launched by the school in 1990 and is still being run with partners at University College London.\n\n\n=== Modern era (2000âpresent) ===\nThe school went through various expansions in 2004, 2009, 2010, 2017, and 2018 to accommodate the school's rapid growth. The expansion in 2010 was the first time the university expanded outside of its Keppel Street location to Tavistock Place. The new location was originally intended as a joint project with UCL, however, the project was eventually amended and scaled down when UCL pulled out of the project. Tavistock Place was further expanded in 2017 with an additional research facility. Moreover, the MRC Unit The Gambia and the MRC Uganda Research Unit officially joined the university in 2018. These transfers were part of the MRC's long-term programme of transferring Units into a host University in order to bring strategic benefits to both parties.\nIn 2004, professor Liam Smeeth was unable to find any association between the MMR vaccine and autism, thereby providing proof against the fraudulent Lancet MMR autism paper by Andrew Wakefield. In subsequent years, professor Joy Lawn led various studies and publications on neonatal deaths, including the 2011 and 2016 The Lancet Stillbirth Series. In 2016, various LSHTM researchers contributed to the understanding of the 2015â16 Zika virus epidemic. A year later, alumnus Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus became the Director-General of the World Health Organization.\nAn independent review published in 2021 concluded there is evidence of structural racism at LSHTM. The findings included that staff of colour are less likely to be promoted, more likely to be on short-term contracts, and that leadership has been too slow to act on issues of colonialism and racism. The school's Director apologised to those who have been affected and stated the school is committed to address the issues. The school's Council commissioned the review in the wake of the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n==== Response to the 2014 Ebola epidemic ====\nWhen the World Health Organization declared that the Western African Ebola virus epidemic was a public health emergency of international concern in August 2014, LSHTM coordinated various response efforts. More than 500 academic and professional services staff volunteered to respond, with many volunteers deployed via Save the Children, Public Health England, MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res and the WHO. LSHTM continued to pay the salary of anyone who volunteered to work on Ebola care and control in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, or backfill posts in WHO offices. Staff and students carried out mathematical modelling and other research to support Ebola response planning. Experts, including LSHTM faculty, established an Ebola Response Anthropology Platform to help health workers develop culturally sensitive interventions and developed free online education programmes to combat the spread of the disease. Researchers, including researchers from LSHTM, carried out accelerated clinical trials in the field, including the EBOVAC Ebola vaccine trials which is still ongoing. LSHTM was part of an independent panel advising on major reforms targeted at prevention of future global outbreaks and now runs the UK Public Health Rapid Support Team in partnership with Public Health England, funded by the UK Government. Former LSHTM Director Peter Piot was named among 'the Ebola fighters' as Time Person of the Year and LSHTM itself also won various awards for its response.\n\n\n== Campus ==\n\nThe school moved to its present location near the intersection of Gower Street and Keppel Street in 1929. A competition to design a new school building to be sited in Gower Street, was held involving five architects, all experienced in laboratory design and construction. This was won in 1925 by Morley Horder and Verner O. Rees who located the main entrance in Keppel Street. The foundation stone was laid in 1926 by Neville Chamberlain, then Minister of Health, and the completed building was opened in 1929 by the Prince of Wales, later to become Edward VIII. The purchase of the site and the cost of a new building was made possible through a gift of $2m from the Rockefeller Foundation.\nAlthough the building's faÃ§ade has remained largely unchanged, the interior has gone through various renovations. The first renovation was completed in 1951 to restore bomb damage sustained during World War II, with the subsequent decades seeing further building work to add and redevelop floors. In 2004 a new seven-storey building within the school's north courtyard was opened by Desmond Tutu, while the Princess Royal opened a new five-storey building in the south of the courtyard in 2009.\nThe school also has a secondary site on Tavistock Place to the east since 2010.\n\n\n== Organisation and administration ==\n\n\n=== Governance ===\nThe school's sole governing body under its Royal Charter is the council. It has sole management control and supervision of the institution, though it delegates some of its functions to its committees and some operational powers to the Director of the school. The Council meets four times a year and has a diverse membership, with various independent members as well as elected staff members and a membership for the Director of the school. The current chair is Don Robert, who is also the Chairman of the London Stock Exchange Group.\nThe school is an exempt charity and as such is regulated by the Office for Students.\n\n\n=== Faculties ===\n\n\n==== Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health ====\nThe Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health aims to develop and use its research expertise ranging from clinical trials, statistical analysis, genetic epidemiology, large-scale observational studies and field trials through to the design and evaluation of clinical and public health interventions in low, middle and high-income countries. It has around 300 academic staff and 150 research students who work in more than 20 countries on topics ranging from infectious to chronic diseases. It runs various master's degree programmes and short courses, while LSHTM's Clinical Trials Unit is also run under this faculty.\n\n\n==== Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases ====\n\nThe Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases (ITD) was formed in August 1997 and encompasses all of the laboratory-based research in the school as well as that on the clinical and epidemiological aspects of infectious and tropical diseases. The Faculty is organised into three large departments and has over 500 members of staff. The range of disciplines represented in the faculty is very broad and inter-disciplinary research is a feature of much of its activity.\nThe spectrum of diseases studied is wide and there are major research groups working on topics which include:\n\nHIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases\nmalaria and other vector borne diseases\ntuberculosis\nvaccine development and evaluation\nvector biology and disease control\nThere is close interaction between scientists in different research teams. The Faculty has overseas links which provide a basis for field studies and international collaborations in developed and developing countries. Funding for research in the Faculty comes from around 45 funding organisations and agencies.\n\n\n==== Faculty of Public Health and Policy ====\nThe Faculty of Public Health and Policy aims to improve global health through research, teaching and the provision of advice in the areas of health policy, health systems and services, and individual, social and environmental influences on health. Interests and activities embrace the health needs of people living in countries at all levels of development.\nThe school has the largest numbers of research active staff in the areas of epidemiology, public health and health services research in the UK.  The Faculty of Public Health and Policy has over 250 members of staff, including epidemiologists, public health physicians, economists, policy analysts, anthropologists, sociologists, historians, psychologists, statisticians and mathematicians. The Faculty's research programmes, with an annual spend of over Â£7m, focus on public health problems of importance both globally and in the UK, and build on an extensive network of collaborations.\nThe research programmes exploit multidisciplinary and multi-method approaches, generate new knowledge for specific contexts and test transferability to different settings, and engage with policymakers and providers of health care to ensure research is relevant and translated into practice.\nThe Faculty hosts School Centres in the areas of History in Public Health, Research on Drugs and Health Behaviours, Spatial Analysis in Public Health, Global Change and Health, Health of Societies in Transition (ECOHOST), and Gender Violence and Health. In addition, staff participate in Centres based in other departments, notably the Malaria Centre and the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Disease.\n\n\n=== Logo ===\n\nThe seal of LSHTM is based on a coin from the archeological site Selinus, Sicily struck in 466 BC. It was designed by the sculptor and medallist Allan Gairdner Wyon. It shows two Greek gods associated with health â Apollo, the god of prophecy, music and medicine, and his sister Artemis, goddess of hunting and chastity, and comforter of women in childbirth â in a horse-drawn chariot. Artemis is driving while her brother the great archer is shooting arrows. The fruitful date palm was added to indicate the tropical activities of the school but also has a close connection with Apollo and Artemis: when their mother Leto gave birth to them on the island of Delos, miraculously a palm sprang up to give her shade in childbirth.\nAsclepius, Apollo's son, was the god of ancient Greek medicine, and was frequently shown holding a staff entwined with a snake. Snakes were used in this healing cult to lick the affected part of the patient. Significantly Asclepius' five daughters were Hygeia (the goddess of healthiness), Panacea (the healer of all ailments), Iaso (recuperation from illness); Aceso (the healing process); and Aegle (radiant good health). Asclepius' staff with a snake coiled round it (known as a symbol of the medical professions) was placed at the base of the seal to emphasise the medical interests of the school. The seal was redesigned in 1990 by Russell Sewell Design Associates, and is retained today within the current LSHTM logo.\n\n\n== Academic profile ==\n\n\n=== Admissions ===\n\nAdmissions data from LSHTM can be obtained through Freedom of Information requests. The school's admissions are competitive, with an offer rate of 60.3% and a yield of 40.1% in 2020/2021. The rates vary by program, with the most recent year showing the MSc Medical Statistics having the lowest offer rate at 49.2% and MSc Control of Infectious Diseases having the highest yield at 55.1%.\n\n\n=== Research ===\n\nWith over Â£180 million in research funding per year, the school engages in a multitude of research activities in over 100 countries. It is home to four World Health Organization Collaborating Centres and participates in many research groups and projects around the world. The school is currently home to the following research centres:\n\nAntimicrobial Resistance Centre\nCentre for Epidemic Preparedness and Response (CEPR)\nCentre for Evaluation\nCentre for Excellence in Learning and Teaching\nCentre for Global Chronic Conditions\nCentre for Global Mental Health\nCentre for History in Public Health\nCentre for Maternal Adolescent Reproductive & Child Health (MARCH)\nCentre for Statistical Methodology\nCentre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases (CMMID)\nCentre on Climate Change and Planetary Health\nGlobal Health Economics Centre\nHealth in Humanitarian Crises Centre\nMalaria Centre\nTB Centre\nThe Applied Genomics Centre\nVaccine Centre\nLSHTM submitted a total of 314 staff across 2 units of assessment to the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF) assessment. In the REF results 42% of the school's submitted research was classified as world-leading (4*), 37% as internationally excellent (3*), 20% as internationally recognised (2*) and 1% as nationally recognised (1*), giving an overall GPA of 3.20. In rankings produced by Times Higher Education based upon the REF results LSHTM was ranked 10th overall for GPA and 46th on research power (which is based on publication volume). In the 2008 exercise, LSHTM ranked 3rd overall for GPA and 59th on research power.\n\n\n=== Degrees ===\nAll three Faculties offer a wide range of MSc courses and Research Degrees leading to a University of London degree of DrPH, MPhil and PhD. The school also offers a Joint PhD Programme for Global Health in partnership with Nagasaki University. Courses are delivered both face-to-face in London and via distance learning in collaboration with the University of London International Programmes. The school also offers access to both free and paid short courses, as well as three Professional Diplomas and an executive programme. Currently, the university does not offer any undergraduate degrees and is therefore one of the few postgraduate-only institutions around the world.\n\n\n=== Rankings ===\n\nDue to the absence of undergraduate degrees, LSHTM is not included in the overall university rankings of QS and Times Higher Education, although some subject-specific rankings are available.\nIn the 2023 ARWU Ranking for the subject of Public Health, LSHTM ranked 3rd globally behind only Harvard University and Johns Hopkins University.\nFor the 2024â2025 US News Best Global Universities Rankings, LSHTM ranked 2nd in Public, Environmental and Occupational Health, 4th in Infectious Diseases, and 15th in the world for Social Sciences and Public Health. The school also ranked 93th in the world for clinical medicine and 34th for cardiovascular systems, 21st for immunology and 59th for microbiology, contributing to an overall ranking of 121st in the world, 42nd in Europe and 12th in the UK.\nIn the 2015 CWTS Leiden Ranking, the LSHTM ranked as the top university in Europe for research impact in all fields, ahead of Oxford and Cambridge. The school was also ranked 6th overall in the world for impact based on the top 1% of published papers in all fields, after MIT, Harvard, Caltech, Stanford and Berkeley, 3rd in the world for biomedical and health sciences, after only MIT and Caltech, and 5th in the world overall for collaborative research. By 2021 the school ranked 27th.\n\n\n=== Awards ===\nThe LSHTM won the 2009 Gates Award for Global Health established by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and received $1 million in prize money. The award recognises organisations that have made an outstanding contribution to improving global health. In 2016, LSHTM won the University of the Year award from Times Higher Education for its response to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa in 2014 and 2015. It won the Queen's Anniversary Prize in 2017 for the same reason and won another Queen's Anniversary Prize in 2021 for its work on COVID-19 and pandemic preparedness.\n\n\n==== Donald Reid Medal ====\nThe Donald Reid Medal is awarded triennially by the LSHTM in recognition of distinguished contributions to epidemiology.\nGeorge Macdonald Medal\nThe George Macdonald Medal is awarded triennially together with Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene to recognise outstanding contributions to tropical hygiene.\n\n\n== Affiliations and partnerships ==\nLSHTM's international profile has led to extensive collaboration with institutions around the world, including in many low- and middle-income countries. From 2014 to 2018, 78% of its publications had been written with an international partner and 65% were written with collaborators over 5,000 kilometers removed from London. International collaborators were most often based in Europe, North America, or Africa. The school is also a member of various global health networks.\nThe school has various official partner institutions including Nagasaki University, National University of Singapore, Public Health Foundation of India, Sichuan University, Fiocruz, Universidade de Sao Paulo, CharitÃ© â UniversitÃ¤tsmedizin Berlin, KU Leuven, and various African research institutes. LSHTM also jointly runs the UK Public Health Rapid Support Team with Public Health England and closely collaborates with various U.K. universities like the University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge, and Imperial College London.\nMoreover, it offers a Professional Diploma in Tropical Medicine & Hygiene through a collaboration with Kilimanjaro Christian Medical University College, Makerere University, University of Washington, and Johns Hopkins University. It also offers joint master's programmes in Health Policy, Planning and Financing with the London School of Economics, Global Mental Health with King's College London, and One Health as well as Veterinary Epidemiology with the Royal Veterinary College.\nThe LSHTM also has partnerships with corporate entities. These include Johnson & Johnson, GlaxoSmithKline, Reckitt, MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res, and the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n=== Notable alumni ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nLise Wilkinson and Anne Hardy, Prevention and cure: the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine: a 20th century quest for global public health, Kegan Paul Limited, 2001, ISBN 0-7103-0624-5.\nG.D.

By Charles Holden, built with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation. Brick load-bearing construction with Portland stone facing. Symmetrical design, not completed, comprising central tower flanked by two courtyard ranges to either side. The southern, completed half, houses the ceremonial and  administrative functions of the University of London. The northern half houses the Institute of Historical Research and School of Slavonic Studies in more functional surrounding: north-east wing not completed. The initial concept of a single, spinal building extending the length of Torrington Square was abandoned as building began, but survives in model form displayed on the first floor balcony of Senate House.  EXTERIOR: central, higher fourth floor is the University library, with above it offices and bookstack housed in the formal 18-storey tower built in recessed stages with broad  central buttresses on the east and west sides. Six windows at first floor level. Four and five storey wings with ten-window forward return and 14 windows width each. Under enriched, flat canopies, two square-headed entrances each side of the central           buttress, all with two-leaf glass doors with vertically patterned metal grills. Above the canopies small rectangular windows with patterned grills and keystones. Square-headed, recessed windows with metal frames, those at first floor level on the tower being elongated with enriched spandrel panels and flanked by medium sized windows at the angles, with balconies, culminating in lunettes at sixth floor level. From the second floor to the 18th, small vertically set windows, in groups of three until the penultimate stage when they are continuous. Flanking wings with metal balconies to windows at angles. Flat roofs with plain bands at parapet levels. East facade similar. Inner courtyards similarly treated, with hopper heads dated 1936. INTERIOR: imposing Egyptianate entrance hall at base of tower with travertine floor and walls with broad fluted pilasters a semi-open space giving through access, with doors to south  leading to Senate House and to north to Institute of Historical Research and School of Slavonic Studies. Senate House. Principal spaces all with travertine cladding to walls and floors, ceilings of moulded plaster with flat panel patterns and embellishments based on a London plane tree motif. Staircases floored in travertine, with bronzed balustrades treated as stylised Ionic columns. Principal entrance hall on two levels with first floor balcony having elaborate bronzed balustrade: Holden's original model exhibited here. On ground floor there is to east the MacMillan Hall, named after Lord MacMillan first Chairman of the University Court, with square panelled ceiling, travertine walls decorated as fluted pilasters at end and to sides set with acoustic panels to Holden's design and coloured glass, teak floor, and original light fittings. Memorials to HRH Queen Mother, Chancellor 1955-80, and to Princess Royal, Chancellor 1981- . William Beveridge Hall, named after the University's Vice Chancellor 1926-8, retains dado panelling set with brass filets in Greek key pattern under acoustic quilting, with semi-permanent seating and stage.On first floor processional stair leads to Chancellor's Hall, with square panelled timber to window recesses, travertine cladding, and square panelled plaster ceilings. Inlay pattern floors, original doors and fittings. To east a suite of rooms set round courtyard includes Court Room and Senate Room. Senate Room and ante rooms fully panelled in English walnut, the former of double height with trabeated ceilings, original fixed seating in stepped rows arranged like a council chamber with dias. Bronze uplighters. Ante rooms with heraldic glass by E Bossanyi dated 1937. On north side committee room and processional suite of corridors with dado panelling and  moulded cornices, original furnishings and fittings. On south side the Vice Chancellor's offices not inspected.  Second floor staff common rooms and third floor common rooms and refectories originally with painted mural ceilings. Those in refectory not seen under later acoustic tiles; war memorial tablet in corridor. Fourth floor libraries of double height. Two general reading rooms, the Middlesex Libraries, finished in oak with original bookshelves and fittings of English walnut. Goldsmith's Library to south with glazed bookcases, and ceiling of cypress wood and stained glass by E Bossanyi. Above these the bookstacks supported by steel frame on concrete raft. The offices retain original doors, lettering and fittings. The  whole is a remarkably unaltered ensemble of 1930s design, with a high proportion of highly decorated ceremonial spaces over functional offices. The Institute of Historical Research and School of Slavonic Studies with ground-floor entrance hall of single-storey  height, travertine floors and finishings similar in style but simpler than those found in Senate House.                   \nSUBSIDIARY FEATURES: attached cast-iron railings on stone sleeper wall and gates of radial pattern with central bosses containing coats of arms. Pillars with pilasters and geometric enrichment, those at the gates surmounted by rectangular down-lighter lamps with small defused panes and topped by stepped features.  HISTORICAL NOTE: built as a landmark, in 1937 this was the tallest building in London apart from St Paul's Cathedral.

    "wikipediaText": "Senate House is the administrative centre of the University of London, situated in the heart of Bloomsbury, London, immediately to the north of the British Museum.\nThe Art Deco building was constructed between 1932 and 1937 as the first phase of a large uncompleted scheme designed for the university by Charles Holden. It consists of 19 floors and is 210 feet (64 m) high.\nDuring the Second World War, the building's use by the Ministry of Information inspired two works of fiction by English writers. The earliest, Graham Greene's novel The Ministry of Fear (1943), inspired a 1944 film adaptation directed by Fritz Lang set in Bloomsbury. The description of the Ministry of Truth in George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) evokes the Senate House. His wife Eileen worked in the building for the Censorship Department of the Ministry of Information.\nToday the main building houses the University of London's Central Academic Bodies and activities, including the offices of the vice-chancellor of the university, the entire collection of the Senate House Library, six of the eight research institutes of the School of Advanced Study, as well as departments of distance learning provider University of London Worldwide.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter the First World War the University of London, then based at the Imperial Institute in Kensington was in urgent need of new office and teaching space to allow for its growth and expansion. In 1921, the government bought 11 acres (4.5 ha) of land in Bloomsbury from the Duke of Bedford to provide a new site for the university. However, many within the university were opposed to a move, and, in 1926, the Duke bought back the land. However, the election of William Beveridge to the post of vice-chancellor of the university in June 1926 was highly significant as Beveridge supported a move to Bloomsbury. Beveridge persuaded the Rockefeller Foundation to donate Â£400,000 to the university and the original site was reacquired in 1927.\n\nBeveridge saw the university as one \"for the nation and the world, drawing from overseas as many students as Oxford and Cambridge and all the other English universities together.\" and specified that \"the central symbol of the University on the Bloomsbury site can not fittingly look like an imitation of any other university, it must not be a replica from the Middle Ages. It should be something that could not have been built by any earlier generation than this, and can only be at home in London ... (the building) means a chance to enrich London â to give London at its heart not just more streets and shops ... but a great architectural feature ... an academic island in swirling tides of traffic, a world of learning in a world of affairs.\"\nThe grand art deco design was the work of Charles Holden, who was appointed as architect in March 1931 from a short list which also included Giles Gilbert Scott, Percy Scott Worthington, and Arnold Dunbar Smith. In making their choice, Beveridge and the Principal, Edwin Deller, were influenced by the success of Holden's recently completed 55 Broadway, designed as the headquarters for the London Electric Railway and then the tallest office building in London.\nHolden's original plan for the university building was for a single structure covering the whole site, stretching almost 1,200 feet (370 m) from Montague Place to Torrington Street. It comprised a central spine linked by a series of wings to the perimeter faÃ§ade and enclosing a series of courtyards. The scheme was to be topped by two towers; the taller Senate House and a smaller one to the north. The design featured elevations of load-bearing brick work faced with Portland stone. Construction began in 1932 and was undertaken by Holland, Hannen & Cubitts. King George V laid the ceremonial foundation stone on 26 June 1933 and the first staff moved in during 1936, the university's centenary year. On 27 November 1936, a group of university officials, led by the Principal, Sir Edwin Deller, went out to inspect the work in progress.  Suddenly, without warning, a skip being pushed by a workman overhead accidentally fell down and hit them.  All were rushed to University College Hospital, where three days later, Deller died of his injuries. Due to a lack of funds, the full design was gradually cut back, and only the Senate House and Library were completed in 1937, although the external flanking wings of the north-eastern courtyard were not constructed. As he had with his earlier buildings, Holden also prepared the designs for the individual elements of the interior design. The completion of the buildings for the Institute of Education and the School of Oriental Studies followed, but the onset of the Second World War prevented any further progress on the full scheme.\n\n\n=== Critical opinion ===\n\nThe architectural character and scale of the building has received both positive and negative criticism since its construction. Steen Eiler Rasmussen, a friend of Holden, commented that, with the expansive design, \"the London University is swallowing more and more of the old houses, and this quarter â which the Duke of Bedford laid out for good domestic houses â has taken on quite a different character.\" Evelyn Waugh, in Put Out More Flags (1942), describes it as \"the vast bulk of London University insulting the autumnal sky.\"\nPositive comments came from functionalist architect Erich Mendelsohn in 1938, who wrote to Holden that he was \"very much taken and am convinced that there is no finer building in London.\" Architectural historian Arnold Whittick described the building as a \"static massive pyramid ... obviously designed to last for a thousand years\", but thought \"the interior is more pleasing than the exterior. There is essentially the atmosphere of dignity, serenity and repose that one associates with the architecture of ancient Greece.\" Nikolaus Pevsner was less enthusiastic. He described its style as \"strangely semi-traditional, undecided modernism\" and summarised the result: \"The design certainly does not possess the vigour and directness of Charles Holden's smaller Underground stations.\" Others have described it as Stalinist or as totalitarian due to its great scale.\nHolden recognised that his architectural style placed him in \"rather a curious position, not quite in the fashion and not quite out of it; not enough of a traditionalist to please the traditionalists and not enough of a modernist to please the modernists.\"\n\n\n=== Present day ===\n\nSenate House remains a prominent landmark throughout Bloomsbury and is visible from some distance away. The building was listed as Grade II* in 1969. Following a multimillion-pound refurbishment in 2006, Senate House has also become a conference and event venue playing host to some of the city's most prestigious events including London Fashion Week.\nFollowing the relaxation of the rules in the UK on university status under the Major government and consequential stirrings towards full independence of the larger London University colleges, the future of Senate House and its library has from time to time been called into question.  However, Senate House remains, and continues to be home both to the vice-chancellor of the University of London and to the deep resources of the university library; indeed, it re-opened in 2006 after undergoing a refurbishment to bring it up to modern standards and to reinstate some of Holden's original interiors.\nSome schools in constituent colleges, such as the Birkbeck School of Computer Science and Information Systems (until 2010), and the School of Advanced Study (the UK's national centre for the facilitation and promotion of research in the humanities and social sciences) are or were based in Senate House. SOAS moved into the north block of Senate House from 2016.\nThe main entrance is from Malet Street to the west and the rear entrance from Russell Square to the east.\nIn recent years, Senate House has been associated with high-profile industrial relations disputes. In December 2018, a boycott of the University of London, including Senate House, organised by the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain and supported by a number of high-profile politicians, journalists and academics, including John McDonnell, Owen Jones, Ken Loach and David Graeber came into effect. This campaign of 'direct action' aims to put pressure on the University of London to bring outsourced workers back into the employment of the university by targeting what is a major source of both prestige and revenue for the university. Numerous events during the 2018â19 academic year were cancelled or relocated, and over 350 individual academics, as well as a number of UCU branches all signatories to the campaign. In May 2019 receptionists, porters as well post room and audio-visual (AV) equipment workers were made University of London staff, followed by security guards in May 2020.\n\n\n== Senate House Library ==\n\nSenate House Library (formerly known as the University of London Library) occupies the fourth to the 18th floors of the building, with the public areas of the library on the fourth to seventh floors. The library is open to staff and students of all colleges within the university (although levels of access differ between institutions) and contains material relevant chiefly to arts, humanities, and social science subjects.\nThe library is administered by the central university as part the Senate House Libraries, and in 2005 had more than 32,000 registered users. It holds around three million volumes, including 120,000 volumes printed before 1851. The library started with the foundation of the University of London in 1836, but began to develop from 1871 when a book fund was started.\nAlong with a subscription to over 5,200 journals, other resources include the Goldsmiths' Library of Economic Literature, and the Palaeography room's collection of western European manuscripts. The library also holds over 170,000 theses by graduate students. From 2006 onwards, the library has been undergoing a comprehensive refurbishment process.\nThe library is also home to the University of London archives, which include the central archive of the university itself and many other collections, including the papers of social reformer Charles Booth, philosopher Herbert Spencer, actress and mystic Florence Farr, author and artist Thomas Sturge Moore, writer Opal Whiteley, and publishing company Gerald Duckworth and Company Ltd.\nSince June 2021, the librarian has been CatrÃ­ona Cannon; she is also director of the Library Transformation Programme for the University of London.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nDue to its imposing architecture, Senate House is popular with the film and television industries as a shooting location; often for official buildings. It inspired the description of the Ministry of Truth in George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four.\nFilms that have featured the building include the 1995 version of Richard III (interior of a government building), the 1984 film of Nineteen Eighty-Four (exterior of the apartment building where O'Brien lives), Blue Ice (a hotel), Spy Game (lobby of CIA Headquarters), Batman Begins (lobby of a court), The Dark Knight Rises (a costume ball), Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang (a war office), Fast & Furious 6 (Moscow Interpol HQ), Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit (Moscow restaurant), No Time to Die (MI6 Reception) and The 355 (a Shanghai casino).\nFor television, the building has featured in Jeeves and Wooster (the exterior of Wooster's Manhattan apartment building),  Killing Eve, and other programmes. Senate House is a prominent location in the first chapters of the 1951 post-apocalyptic novel The Day of the Triffids by John Wyndham, and was thus used (as itself) in the television adaptation The Day of the Triffids.\nIn CJ Sansomâs 2014 alternative history novel, Dominion, the building has been taken over as the 1952 German embassy.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of tallest buildings and structures in London\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nCherry, Bridget; Pevsner, Nikolaus (1998).

Denys Lasdun for London University.     \n\n                    \n\n\n    \n        Reasons for Designation\n    \n    \n        The Philips Building at SOAS, Thornhaugh Street, a university library completed in 1973 to designs by Denys Lasdun, is designated at Grade II* for the following principal reasons: \n*\tArchitectural interest: while relatively little-known, this pavilion library is one of the most powerful library designs of the post-war period, also of interest for being a work of this major post-war architect\n* \tInterior quality: the main library space is remarkable. Through a complex structure of terraces, a skilful employment of natural light via a concrete diagrid ceiling and good-quality finishes throughout, Lasdun created a dramatic and memorable learning environment\n* \tPlanning: a manifestation of the continuous teaching building which Lasdun successfully explored; it pre-dates his designated University of East Anglia; and also managed to make an architectural set piece out of what was a truncated scheme\n* \tGroup value: the library groups well with the Grade II Holden building it was built to serve, the Grade II late-C18 terraces of Woburn square (glimpses of which are caught from the impressive windows of the library); and Lasdun's own Grade II* Institute of Education, the striking massing and materials of which it emulates\n\n    \n\n                    \n\n\n        \n            History\n        \n        \n            The Philips Building at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) has its origins in the London University spinal development plan of 1959, devised by the renowned LCC architects Sir Leslie Martin and Trevor Dannatt. It was Martin who recommended Denys Lasdun (1914-2002) as the architect for the new buildings at SOAS which were to form part of the development of the central area of the University's Bloomsbury site. The University had moved its principal headquarters (at Charles Holden's iconic Senate House, now designated Grade II*) and some of the smaller institutes, such as SOAS, to Bloomsbury in the 1930s although the war prevented implementation of the ambitious (and forbidding) masterplan that would have marched a linear spine of buildings north through Bloomsbury. SOAS was established in Finsbury Circus in order to train people working in Asia and Africa, and it received its London University Charter in 1913. Its original building was housed in the building of 1940, purpose-built also by Holden to hold what was by then a well-established school. This building was designated at Grade II just 29 years after it was built.  Lasdun accepted the commission for the SOAS library in 1960 and full planning approval was granted in 1968.  The chosen site, to the north of the Holden building, infringed on the small but well-formed Woburn Square. This prompted a conservation fight of the type emerging in London at this time. It was long enough after the war for Londoners to have views on what should be preserved in the face of new building, and students, faculty and local residents protested the demolition of the increasingly-appreciated Georgian town houses. A London University Special Committee narrowly rejected the calls to preserve the square and demolition began in July 1969.  The building contract officially began in January 1970 and was completed in May 1973.   Lasdun's design changed the concept that Martin and Dannatt had promoted in their master plan for the site. This resulted from his brief to create more pedestrian areas, as well as being a response to the truncated nature of the scheme when financial and conservation issues emerged. He implemented the envisioned dominant 'spine' in his impressive Institute of Education (to the east along Bedford Way, and designated Grade II*) and instead turned the library into a distinct 'pavilion' that formed part of a new pedestrianised square. The library was designed at about the same time as the library in his major scheme for the University of East Anglia (UEA).Denys Lasdun is one of the most distinctive and creative of post-war architects. He is one of the few to have begun practicing before WWII, when he worked for Wells Coates, and after a distinguished military service he joined Lubetkin and Tecton, and Fry and Drew, before establishing his own practice in 1960 when his own style emerged. This was a synthesis of 1930's modernism with a strong horizontality derived from Frank Lloyd Wright (whose planning he came to admire in the 1950s) and an interest in expressing services that makes for comparison with another American architect, Louis Kahn. Perhaps of all British architects, Lasdun's work best demonstrates the cool, four-square and intellectually rigorous qualities of Kahn's work. Most of Lasdun's surviving buildings in England are now designated, many at high grades, such as the Royal College of Physicians at Grade I, and the nearby London University Institute of Education, the UEA Ziggurats, Keeling House and the National Theatre at Grade II*. \n\n        \n        \n            Details\n        \n        \n            MATERIALS: \nA reinforced concrete frame of in situ concrete and interlocking structural pre-cast concrete panels with a white cement and Ballidon limestone aggregate mix, with a grit-basted finish. The windows are mostly horizontal sliding sashes with aluminium and bronze anodised finish, set back from the precast panels.EXTERIOR: \nThe Philips Building closes the southern end of Woburn Square, and the leafy trees and late-Georgian terraces were intended to be glimpsed from the building. It is essentially a library, built to house its collection of then half a million books (now grown to over a million), also with teaching rooms and offices. The eight-storey building does not have its own external ceremonial entrance, which was always through the listed Holden block. The roofs are flat, with a series of diagonally-arranged north-facing roof lights, hidden from the outside. The central library dominates and projects on three floors with a set-back range of academic offices and classrooms (totalling 220 separate rooms) above. Each of the facades of this square, pavilion-plan building has nine bays and there are set-back corners on the four lower storeys. The ground floor formerly had projecting balconies, or terraces, but these were glazed in on the north and east elevations around 2007 (also by John McAslan and Partners, and apparently with the blessing of Lasdun, before he died). A service moat around the building provides light to the basement levels and a delivery entrance on the west side. INTERIOR: \nThe set piece is the central, top-lit library. This features three levels of concrete-fronted balconies and natural light comes in through a diagonally-set grid of slender concrete ceiling beams. On the lower floors, rooms lead off to provide study and tutorial space within the library, and computer areas to which the centre of the lower level is now dedicated. Reading areas extend into the former terraces, which are now part of the library's interior, and include a mezzanine level divided by concrete fins. There are other concrete partitions within the stacks that frame openings while supporting the floors. Two original concrete book counters survive: the book issue counter on the lower level of the library, and the book return counter, now isolated in a room on the ground floor. The original model for the building is housed in a case in the basement. The main, full-height library stair has a concrete parapet with metal tubular hand rail (currently painted red, but original colour to be confirmed). The concrete here, and in the main stair outside the library, which is nestled into a concrete service core, has a fair-faced horizontal close boarded finish. A further stair from the ground floor down was added near the lifts by John McAslan and Partners around 2000. The upper corridors, which wrap around the central library, largely retain the simple grooved timber doors and architraves and some original cork floors. The original arrangement with a window at the end of each corridor largely remains, although some temporary rooms have been added to these spaces, blocking off the light and the view. The toilets were refurbished in 2009. There is a lecture hall with slatted wooden wall covering on the lower ground floor.

Williams Dunford, reconfigured internally in 1979.EXTERIOR: The church comprises two sections, the auditorium and a smaller range to the north. Both are two storeys and built with stock brick with red brick dressings. The auditorium section has a faÃ§ade in a variant of the Queen Anne style to Markhouse Road and a tower, the lighthouse, on the corner of this and Downsfield Road. The faÃ§ade is essentially of four bays although there is irregularity in the fenestration which creates a busy, quirky overall effect, particularly in combination with the asymmetry created by the lighthouse. Red brick colonnettes, or ribs, mark the bays and there are terracotta cornices and string courses across the faÃ§ade and the pedimented gable end with its oculus. The latter has 'AD 1893' carved in the apex. To the ground storey, there are two double doors, the larger pair set under a canopy comprising a pediment carried on tall scroll brackets. There are also two triplets of round-headed windows with gauged red brick round arches. Plasterwork plaques above these read 'United Methodist' and 'Free Churches'. Another plaque reads 'U.M.F.C.'. The upper storey contains three single windows with segmental moulded terracotta surrounds and terracotta aprons ornamented with garlands. The windows and doors are original. The architecture is evocative of the Salvation Army Citadels of the same period. The red brick ribs are reminiscent of the armoury references employed in Salvation Army architecture to convey a fortress-like quality. They have the same effect at the Lighthouse Methodist Church, which, stylistically, is more a late C19 mission hall than a church.  The lighthouse is a circular turret with a steep slated octagonal spire topped by a domed lantern. The door at its base faces the corner, but provides a counterbalance to the identical door in the southernmost bay of the faÃ§ade. The lintel contains the foundation stone, recording commencement of building in January 1892. Above this is a plaque announcing 'The Lighthouse' and above that a small shield bearing the inscription 'Have Faith in God'. The lighthouse has the same terracotta colonnettes and stringcourses as the faÃ§ade and simple rectangular lights with plain lintels and cills, painted white. Two slit windows in the form of crosses (which also feature on Salvation Army Citadels) and the spiralling moulded string course, painted white, contribute to the lighthouse theme and the whimsical nature of the design. The architect's original drawings of the faÃ§ade survive and reveal it has been little altered; a small turret on the south-east corner of the elevation was either not built or has been removed. The lighthouse turret is distinctive, particularly given the church's inland location, and is an uncommon feature of the design. Despite the obvious link between Christian imagery of Jesus as the Light of the World and the function of a lighthouse, there are no known examples of church designs which use a lighthouse architectural feature.  The side elevations are plainer, having regular fenestration with red brick flat arches set in relieving panels with red brick stepped tops. The same theme is continued on the two storey block to the north which has a canted bay front and a tiny oculus in the gable end, which appears to have been rebuilt in the late C20.INTERIOR: Substantially altered in 1979, though the original configuration remains readable. The original galleried auditorium has been divided laterally and the ground floor then subdivided into four rooms. The iron columns which support the gallery are still visible. A staircase has been inserted in the centre of the building, giving access to the remodelled worship space above. The two original staircases, in the north-east and south-east corners of the building, retain their treads but the balusters appear to be later replacements and the stairwells have been panelled in the 1979 refurbishment. The upper auditorium retains its coffered ceiling, which indicates the changes that took place in 1979, most significantly the insertion of a partition wall. Behind this, in the 1979 inserted stairwell, the proscenium arch and balcony arcading of the original auditorium survive. These features are evocative of the Edwardian music hall appearance of the original interior. The organ survives, though re-sited, but the stained glass which once adorned the two windows behind the proscenium arch has been removed. Inside the second block are two rooms with surviving joinery including a fireplace and wall cupboards in the ground floor room.   HISTORY: The Lighthouse Methodist Church opened in 1893 and was a replacement for a house in Myrtle Road, Walthamstow which had served the group of Methodists, originally from a Wesleyan church in Hackney, who began the church mission in 1887. After the break with their parent church, the group planned a United Free Church (meaning that the minister's post would be unsalaried). An early supporter of the church was Captain King of the Bullard King Steamers, a company which ran the direct service from London to East African ports and in 1889 commenced sailings from India to South Africa to carry field labourers for sugar plantations. In 1889 Captain King donated the site on Markhouse Road and paid for the building, begun in 1892, the design and name of which are reminders of his seafaring activities. The church was designed by the architect J. Williams Dunford, about whom little is known. The lighthouse originally had a revolving light which beamed out on winter mornings during the Sunday service. The church was the best-attended nonconformist church in Walthamstow in 1903 with congregations of over 1,500. SUMMARY OF IMPORTANCE: The Lighthouse Methodist Church, which opened in 1893, was designed by J. Williams Dunford. Its patron was Captain King of the Bullard King Steamers and the design and name of the church are reminders of his seafaring profession. The cross-shaped slit windows and other armoury references connect the building to late C19 missionary movements such as the Salvation Army. Despite alterations to the interior, the church is of special architectural interest, as evidenced by its curious lighthouse design, untypical use of a variant of the Queen Anne style and remaining internal features which evoke the music hall character of the auditorium. There is also historic significance: the church is illustrative of the C19 pattern of swift Methodist church building which was dependent on the support of patrons. The interior has been much altered in the 1979 reconfiguration and, although the elements of the original features that survive are important, the special interest is concentrated on the exterior.\n        \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n    \n        Legacy\n    \n    \n        The contents of this record have been generated from a legacy data system.\n    \n    \n        \n            Legacy System number:\n            \n                502488\n            \n        \n        \n            Legacy System:\n            \n                LBS\n            \n        \n    \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n\n\n\n                    \n                        \n\n\n    \n        Legal\n    \n\n\n    \n        This building is listed under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as amended for its special architectural or historic interest.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n\n            \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n            \n                Map\n            \n            \n                This map is for quick reference purposes only and may not be to scale.

    "wikipediaText": "Vestry House Museum is a history museum in Walthamstow focusing on the heritage of the local area. The collection includes various artefacts dating from the Victorian era to the 20th century, including numerous archived documents and photographs.\nVestry House was originally built as a workhouse and was later used as a police station and also as private housing (amongst the exhibits is a replica police cell demonstrating one of the building's previous uses). The building became a museum in 1931.\nOn permanent display in the museum is the Bremer Car, the first British motor car with an internal combustion engine, which was built by Frederick Bremer (1872â1941) in a workshop at the back of his family home in Connaught Road, Walthamstow. The car first ran in 1892 and was donated to the museum by Bremer in 1933.\nIn 2023, the museum began a revitalisation led by architects Studio Weave  \n\n\n== References =="

    "wikipediaText": "Claremont, also known historically as 'Clermont', is an 18th-century Palladian mansion less than a mile south of the centre of Esher in Surrey, England. The buildings are now occupied by Claremont Fan Court School, and its landscaped gardens are owned and managed by the National Trust. Claremont House is a Grade I listed building.\n\n\n== Claremont estate ==\nThe first house on the Claremont estate was built in 1708 by Sir John Vanbrugh, the Restoration playwright and architect of Blenheim Palace and Castle Howard, for his own use. This \"very small box\", as he described it, stood on the level ground in front of the present mansion. At the same time, he built the stables and the walled gardens, also probably White Cottage, which is now the Sixth Form Centre of Claremont Fan Court School.\nIn 1714, he sold the house to the wealthy Whig politician Thomas Pelham-Holles, Earl of Clare, who later became Duke of Newcastle and served twice as Prime Minister. The earl commissioned Vanbrugh to add two great wings to the house and to build a fortress-like turret on an adjoining knoll. From this so-called \"prospect-house\", or belvedere, he and his guests could admire the views of the Surrey countryside as they took refreshments and played hazard, a popular dice game.\nIn the clear eighteenth-century air it was apparently possible to see Windsor Castle and St Paul's Cathedral. The Earl of Clare named his country seat Clare-mount, later contracted to Claremont. The two lodges at the Copsem Lane entrance were added at this time.\n\n\n== Landscape garden ==\n\nClaremont landscape garden is one of the earliest surviving gardens of its kind of landscape design, the English Landscape Garden â still featuring its original 18th century layout.  The extensive landscaped grounds of Claremont represents the work of some of the best known landscape gardeners, Charles Bridgeman, Capability Brown, William Kent (with Thomas Greening) and Sir John Vanbrugh.\nWork on the gardens began around 1715 and, by 1727, they were described as \"the noblest of any in Europe\". Within the grounds, overlooking the lake, is an unusual turfed amphitheatre.\nA feature in the grounds is the Belvedere Tower, designed by Vanbrugh for the Duke of Newcastle. The tower is unusual in that, what appear to be windows, are actually bricks painted black and white.  It is now owned by Claremont Fan Court School, which is situated alongside the gardens.\nIn 1949, the landscape garden was donated to the National Trust for stewardship and protection. A restoration programme was launched in 1975 following a significant donation by the Slater Foundation. The garden is Grade I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.\n\n\n== Capability Brown's mansion, built for Lord Clive of India ==\nThe Duke of Newcastle died in 1768 and, in 1769, his widow sold the estate to Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive, founder of Britain's Indian Empire. Although the great house was then little more than fifty years old, it was aesthetically and politically out of fashion. Lord Clive decided to demolish the house and commissioned Capability Brown to build the present Palladian mansion on higher and dryer ground. Brown, more accomplished as a landscape designer than an architect, took on his future son-in-law Henry Holland as a junior partner owing to the scale of the project. John Soane (later Sir John Soane) was employed in Holland's office at this time and worked on the project as a draftsman and junior designer. Holland's interiors for Claremont owe much to the contemporary work of Robert Adam.\nLord Clive, by now a rich Nabob, is reputed to have spent over Â£100,000 on rebuilding the house and the complete remodelling of the celebrated pleasure ground. However, Lord Clive ended up never living at the property, as he died in 1774âthe year that the house was completed. The estate then passed through a rapid succession of owners; first being sold \"for not more than one third of what the house and alterations had cost\" to Robert Monckton-Arundell, 4th Viscount Galway, and then to George Carpenter, 2nd Earl of Tyrconnell, and finally to Charles Ellis, 1st Baron Seaford.\nA large map entitled \"Claremont Palace\", situated in what is called \"Clive's room\" inside the mansion, shows the mansion and its surrounding grounds; giving a detailed overview of the campus. The map likely dates back to the 1860s, when the mansion was frequently occupied by Queen Victoria (thus it having been christened \"palace\"). However, the exact date is still unknown. The relief in Claremont's front pediment is of Clive's coat of arms impaled with that of Maskelyne, his wife's family.\n\n\n== Royal residence ==\n\nIn 1816, Claremont was bought by the British Nation through an Act of Parliament as a wedding present for George IV's daughter Princess Charlotte and her husband Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg. At that time, the estate was valued to Parliament at Â£60,000: \"Mr Huskisson stated that it had been agreed to purchase the house and demesnes of Clermont... The valuation of the farms, farm-houses, and park, including 350 acres of land, was 36,000/; the mansion, 19,000/; and the furniture, 6,000/; making together 60,000/. The mansion, which is in good repair, could not be built now for less than 91,000/.\" To the nation's great sorrow, however, Princess Charlotte, who was second in line to the throne, was, after two miscarriages, to die there after giving birth to a stillborn son in November the following year. This sorrow is expressed in Letitia Elizabeth Landon's poem Lines on the Mausoleum of the Princess Charlotte, at Claremont, published in Forget Me Not, 1824. Although Leopold retained ownership of Claremont until his death in 1865, he left the house in 1831 when he became the first King of the Belgians.\n\nQueen Victoria was a frequent visitor to Claremontâboth as a child and later as an adultâwhen Leopold, her doting uncle, lent her the house. She, in turn, lent the house to the exiled French King and Queen, Louis-Philippe and Marie-Amelie (the parents-in-law of Leopold I of Belgium), after the Revolutions of 1848. The exiled King died at Claremont in 1850. \nIn 1857, Offenbach and his Bouffes company performed three of his opÃ©ras bouffes there for Marie Amelie and her sons during an eight-week tour of England.\nIn 1870, Queen Victoria commissioned Francis John Williamson to sculpt a marble memorial to Charlotte and Leopold which was erected inside the house. (The memorial was subsequently moved to St George's Church, Esher.)\nVictoria bought Claremont for her fourth, and youngest, son Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, when he married Princess Helena of Waldeck and Pyrmont in 1882. The Duke and Duchess of Albany had two childrenâAlice and Charles. Charles, who had been born at Claremont in 1884, inherited the title and position of Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha upon the death of his uncle, Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, in 1900. He moved to the duchy in Germany to fulfill the position, becoming a German citizen, and renouncing his claim in the British succession.\nClaremont should have passed to Charles upon his mother's death in 1922, but because he served as a German general in the First World War, the British government disallowed the inheritance. Claremont was accordingly confiscated and sold by the Public Trustee to shipping magnate Sir William Corry, director of the Cunard Line. Two years after Sir William's death, in 1926, it was bought by Eugen Spier, a wealthy German financier. \nIn 1930, Claremont stood empty and was marked for demolition when it was bought, together with the Belvedere, the stables, and 30 acres (12 ha) of parkland, by the Governors of a south London school, later renamed Claremont School and, since 1978, has been known as Claremont Fan Court School.\n\n\n== The National Trust ==\nThe National Trust acquired 50 acres (0.20 km2) of the Claremont estate in 1949. In 1975, with a grant from the Slater Foundation, it set about restoring the eighteenth-century landscape garden. The Claremont Landscape Garden now displays the successive contributions of the great landscape gardeners who worked on it: Sir John Vanbrugh, Charles Bridgeman, William Kent, and Capability Brown.\n\n\n== See also ==\nA307, Portsmouth Road\nClaremont Fan Court School\nClaremont Landscape Garden\nSt. George's Church, Esher\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nTurner, Roger, Capability Brown and the Eighteenth Century English Landscape, 2nd ed.

    "wikipediaText": "St George's Church, Esher is a Grade I listed Anglican church in Esher, Surrey, England.  Built in the 16th century, it was Esher's parish church for 300 years, though later worshippers included Queen Victoria.  However, by the mid-19th century the building was deemed too small for the growing population, and was replaced by Christ Church, built nearby on Esher Green in 1853/4.  St George's was not therefore subjected to Victorian âimprovementsâ, and its Tudor origins remain evident. It is now cared for by the Churches Conservation Trust.   \n\n\n== History ==\nEsher is mentioned in the Domesday Book, but there is no mention of a church; the first record of a patron and rector appears in 1292, but little remains of any previous building, except a doorway on the south side of the nave and the priest's door (now walled in) on the north side of the chancel, both probably 15th century.  A rare example of an English church built during the Reformation, the present building was built about 1540 of a jumbled assortment of chequered sandstone, clunch, undressed flint and brick, and roofed with both stone and clay tiles, with a small oaken timber bell- or clock-turret with pyramid spire.  Inside, the Tudor open roof remains, with timber tie and collar beams; referring to its vernacular construction, Simon Jenkins says: \". . . St. George's cannot decide whether it is a barn masquerading as a chapel, or a chapel masquerading as a barn.\"  The wooden clock-turret houses the original clock mechanism from the early 17th century, the face and hour hand being added in 1783.  Various additions made in the 18th and early 19th centuries include the three-decker pulpit and reredos of 1722 with fine carving, the Newcastle Pew (1725-26), and the brick north aisle with crenellated gables (1812). \n\n\n=== Newcastle Pew ===\nIn 1725â26 a brick extension, with a slate roof and its own entrance, was added to the south side of the church.  The extension contains a remarkable family chamber pew built to Sir John Vanbrughâs design for the 1st Duke of Newcastle, who had purchased Vanbrugh's nearby country house, Claremont, and therefore worshipped at St George's, as did Newcastle's brother, Henry Pelham of Esher Place.  Connected to the body of the church through a bay in the south wall, the pew has a temple front of eight Corinthian columns and pilasters surmounted by a pediment of pine.  The Georgian interior of the pew was later divided into two sets of three boxes, the inhabitants of Claremont sitting on the right, and those of Esher Place on the left, each with their own fireplace.  Vanbrugh also replaced the Tudor windows of the church with those of Georgian style: the only remaining stained glass window was removed to the Great Hall of Wadham College, Oxford.  George IIâs royal coat of arms hangs from the chancel beam. \nThe Duke of Newcastle's successors at Claremont would all have worshipped at St George's at some time.  These include Princess Charlotte, only child of George IV and heiress presumptive to the throne, who died at Claremont; her husband Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, later first King of the Belgians; his niece by marriage, the young Princess Victoria; her youngest son Leopold; and Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone.  A sculpted triptych memorial to Charlotte and Leopold, commissioned in 1870 from Francis John Williamson by Queen Victoria and originally in their former home, Claremont, stands at the west end of the north aisle.\n\n\n== St Georgeâs today ==\nAfter Christ Church was built, St George's fell into some disrepair, but it was restored by the community in 1965, and remains a consecrated building, now in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust and supported locally by the Friends of St George's Church.  St George's is not open every day, but several services are held each year. It can also be visited on Saturday mornings during the summer, and is a periodic venue for music and the arts. The church may be visited by borrowing a key from an adjacent property (Monday to Saturday inclusive).\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of places of worship in Elmbridge\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBlatch, Mervyn (1997).

    "wikipediaText": "Wickham Court is a semi-fortified country house in West Wickham, Bromley, a borough of south-east London and historically and traditionally part of the county of Kent. The house dates from the time of Henry VII and is a Grade I listed building.\nThe house is a square brick-built structure of 3 storeys which once enclosed a small open courtyard, since roofed over. There are octagonal 5-storey turrets at each corner and both the house and turrets have castellated parapets. The east front has 4 windows, the other fronts 3 windows. A porch with a crow-stepped gable was added to the west side during the reign of Charles I. A modern attic storey with dormer windows and a modern wing on the South front have also been added.\nSince September 2023 this building has become a Coptic Orthodox Church, named St Mary and St John having moved from Elmers End Beckenham.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe house was originally built for Sir Henry Heydon (died 1504) who married Anne Boleyn, the daughter of Sir Geoffrey Boleyn, great-grandfather of Henry VIII's wife Anne Boleyn. It was then sold by the Heydon family to John Lennard in 1579 and passed down in the Lennard family, many of whom were baronets, to 1929. In that year Sir Stephen Lennard, Bt. emigrated to Canada, and Wickham Court became an hotel. It was requisitioned in the Second World War for use as Army offices and accommodation.\nIn 1952 it was acquired by Coloma College of Education (a teacher training establishment), and then from 1978 to 1996 occupied by Schiller International University. In 2003 it became home to Wickham Court Preparatory School. The school closed in 2023.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWickham Court Preparatory School website"

    "wikipediaText": "Red House is a significant Arts and Crafts building located in Bexleyheath, south-east London, England. Co-designed in 1859 by the architect Philip Webb and the designer William Morris, it was created to serve as a family home for Morris. Construction was completed in 1860.\nFollowing an education at the University of Oxford, Morris decided to construct a rural house for himself and his new wife, Jane Morris, within a commuting distance of central London. Purchasing a plot of land in what at the time was the village of Upton in Kent, he employed his friend Webb to help him design and construct the house, financing the project with money inherited from his wealthy family. Morris was deeply influenced by Medievalism and Medieval-inspired Neo-Gothic styles are reflected throughout the building's design. It was constructed using Morris' ethos of craftsmanship and artisan skills and is an early example of what came to be known as the Arts and Crafts movement.\nA number of Morris' friends visited, most notably the Pre-Raphaelite painters Edward Burne-Jones and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, both of whom aided him in decorating the House; various Burne-Jones wall murals remain. While at Red House, Morris was involved in the formation of his design company, Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co., and embarked on his earliest wallpaper designs. It was also here that his two daughters, Jenny and May, were born. Although initially intending to live there for the rest of his life, Morris found that the house proved too expensive to run and did not suit his lifestyle. After five years, he moved his family to a flat in Queen Square, Bloomsbury and sold the property.\nRed House remained a private residence for various individuals from 1866 until 2002, during which period various alterations were made to the interior design. In 1950 it was designated a Grade I listed building by English Heritage. From 1952 to 1999 the architect Edward Hollamby lived at the House, initiating attempts at preservation and establishing the Friends of Red House charity in 1998. In 2003, the National Trust purchased the property, undertaking a project of conservation and maintaining it as a visitor attraction with an accompanying tea room and gift shop.\n\n\n== William Morris at Red House ==\n\nWilliam Morris was born in Walthamstow, Essex, on 24 March 1834, and raised in a wealthy middle-class family. Although his father died in 1847, the Morris family remained affluent as a result of shares in the Devon Great Consols copper mines. In 1853 Morris began university studies at Exeter College, Oxford, focusing on Classics. There, he developed a keen interest in Medieval history and Medieval architecture, inspired by Oxford's many medieval buildings. This interest was tied to Britain's growing Medievalist movement, a form of Romanticism that rejected many of the values of Victorian industrial capitalism. For Morris, the Middle Ages represented an era with strong chivalric values and an organic, pre-capitalist sense of community, both of which he deemed preferable to his own period. He was heavily influenced by the writings of art critic John Ruskin, being particularly inspired by his chapter \"On the Nature of Gothic Architecture\" in the second volume of The Stones of Venice. Morris adopted Ruskin's philosophy of rejecting the tawdry industrial manufacture of decorative arts and architecture in favour of a return to hand-craftsmanship, raising artisans to the status of artists, and creating art that should be affordable and hand-made, with no hierarchy of artistic mediums.\nAt Oxford, Morris became the best friend of fellow undergraduate Edward Burne-Jones; they had a shared attitude to life and a keen mutual interest in Arthurianism. Having passed his finals and been awarded a BA in 1856, Morris began an apprenticeship with the Oxford-based Gothic revival architect George Edmund Street in January 1856. There he was placed under the supervision of Philip Webb, who became a close friend. He soon relocated to Street's London office, in August 1856 moving into a flat in Bloomsbury, Central London with Burne-Jones. Morris was fascinated by London but dismayed at its pollution and rapid expansion into neighbouring countryside, describing it as \"the spreading sore\". Preferring rural life, Morris became increasingly fascinated with the Pre-Raphaelites and soon met one of the foremost Pre-Raphaelite painters, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, after Burne-Jones became Rossetti's disciple; the three soon became close friends. Through Rossetti, Morris came to associate with poet Robert Browning, and the artists Arthur Hughes, Thomas Woolner, and Ford Madox Brown. At Rossetti's recommendation, Morris and Burne-Jones moved in together to a flat at No. 17 Red Lion Square in Bloomsbury by November 1856. Morris designed and commissioned furniture for the flat in a Medieval style, much of which he painted with Arthurian scenes in a direct rejection of mainstream artistic tastes.\nIn October 1857 Morris met Jane Burden, a woman from a working-class background, at a theatre performance and asked her to model for him. Smitten with her, they entered into a relationship and were engaged in spring 1858; Burden would later admit, however, that she never loved Morris. They were married in a simple ceremony held at St Michael at the North Gate church in Oxford on 26 April 1859, before honeymooning in Bruges, Belgium. Newly married, Morris decided to construct a house for himself and his bride. He commissioned Webb, who was then setting out as and architect independent of Street, to help him design it.\n\n\n=== Origins and construction: 1859â60 ===\n\nMorris envisioned Red House as being not only a family home, but also a background to his ongoing artistic work. He wanted it to be situated in a rural area that was not far from London, and chose to search in Kent because it was his favourite county; he particularly enjoyed its geographical mix of large open spaces with small hills and rivers, favourably contrasting it to the flat expanse of his native Essex. After looking at various locations for sale in the area, he settled on a plot of land in the village of Upton in West Kent; although ten miles to London by road, it was situated three miles from the nearest railway station, Abbey Wood railway station. At Upton, Morris purchased an orchard and a meadow, wanting his new home to be surrounded by an apple and cherry orchard. Morris would likely have been pleased that Upton was close to the track that pilgrims followed to Canterbury Cathedral during the Middle Ages, and would also have had the opportunity to visit the ruins of the Medieval Lesnes Abbey which were around three miles away.\nWhile Red House was under construction, Morris and his wife lived in rented accommodations at 41 Great Ormond Street, just along the road from Webb's office, at 7 Great Ormond Street. However, as the project neared completion, the Morrises moved to Amberley Lodge, close to the site, so that Morris could monitor the builder's progress. Webb and Morris would work on the design of the house together. Thus, the National Trust have described it as \"a complex fusion of Morris's romantic utopianism and Webb's practical common sense\", while Edward and Doris Hollamby described it as \"a collaborative effort in which we cannot separate one from the other\". Red House would be Webb's first project as an independent architect, while it remained the only house that Morris ever built.  The actual construction was given to a contractor, and the structure took a year to build. It cost Morris approximately Â£4,000, at a time when the value of his shares was dropping.\nUnique in its design, Red House was designed to an L-shaped plan, with two stories and a high-pitched roof made of red tile. The large hall, dining room, library, morning room, and kitchen were located on the ground floor, while on the first floor were situated the main living rooms, the drawing room, the studio, and the bedrooms. The servants' quarters were larger than in most contemporary buildings, reflecting the embryonic ideas regarding working class conditions which would lead Morris and Webb to become socialists in later life. Windows were positioned to suit the design of the rooms rather than to fit an external symmetry; thus a variety of different window types are present, including tall casements, hipped dormers, round-headed sash-windows, and bull's eye windows. The house lacked any applied ornamentation, with its decorative features instead serving constructional purposes, such as the arches over the windows, and the louvre in the open roof over the staircase. According to Morris' biographer J.W. Mackail, the external design of the house was \"plain almost to severity, and depended for its effect on its solidity and fine proportion.\" This was somewhat radical at the time, as most contemporary buildings were heavily furnished with ornamentation. Rosseti termed it \"a real wonder of the age ... which baffles all description\", while Morris biographer Fiona MacCarthy described it as \"the ultimate Pre-Raphaelite building\".\n\nThe architecture of Red House was inspired by styles of British design from the thirteenth century, and Morris described the building as being \"very mediaeval in spirit\". Historian E.P. Thompson asserted that the house \"was built, notâas in previous Gothic revivalsâin an attempt to combine a number of superficial medieval characteristics which pleased the taste of the architect, but in a definite attempt to adapt late Gothic methods of building to the needs of the nineteenth century.\"\nLater owners of the property, Edward and Doris Hollamby, described Red House as Webb and Morris' attempt to \"apply Gothic principles to domestic architecture without archaeological imitation\". While asserting that it was certainly \"a far cry from the Victorian bourgeois norm\", MacCarthy stated that it was \"by no means a revolutionary building\", having much in common with other Neo-Gothic buildings of the period, comparing its \"complicated dense\" interiors to those of the architect Augustus Pugin.\nWhen the building itself had been constructed, Morris set about decorating the interior, however specifically chose to design and create almost everything himself. Only a few pieces of decor were pre-bought as ready-made items, namely the Persian carpets, and blue china or delft. Morris took his painted settle from the Red Lion Square flat and had it transported in pieces to Red House, where it was reassembled in the drawing room. Many other items of furniture were specially designed by Webb, including the oak dining table, other tables, chairs, cupboards, copper candlesticks, fire dogs, and glass tableware. The plastered walls and ceilings were given simple designs in tempera, although more complex designs were planned for the hall and main living rooms. Stained glass windows were installed in the house, with designs created by Burne-Jones and Webb. In reference to the route taken by Medieval pilgrims headed to Canterbury, Morris termed the passage which connects the main hallway to the house's rear entrance, \"The Pilgrim's Rest\". The garden was similarly unique in its design, with Morris insisting on integration of the design of the house and garden; the latter was divided into four small square gardens by trellises on which roses grew. The flower beds were bordered with lavender and rosemary while lilies and sunflowers had also been planted in the garden. White jasmine, roses, honeysuckle and passion flower were planted to climb up the walls of the house.\n\n\n=== Morris' life at Red House: 1860â1865 ===\n\nMorris and his wife moved into Red House at the end of the summer of 1860. At the time, he envisioned living there for the rest of his life, although ultimately would only stay there for five years. Morris' friends regularly came to visit; Burne-Jones and his new bride, Georgiana Burne-Jones, would often spend their Sundays at Red House, while other regular visitors included Rossetti, Faulkner and his two sisters, Webb, Swinburne, Madox Brown, and Arthur Hughes. Here, Burne-Jones and Faulkner often played practical jokes on Morris, for instance, doctoring a pack of playing cards or sewing up his clothing to make it feel much tighter. The group of friends liked to play hide and seek at the house, and in the evenings would gather around the piano to sing songs.\nIt was at Red House that Morris and Janey's two children were born; in January 1861, a daughter named Jane Alice Morris, who would come to be known as \"Jenny\". Jenny was followed in March 1862 by the birth of their second daughter, Mary \"May\" Morris. Morris was a caring father to his daughters, and years later they both recounted having had idyllic childhoods. However, there were problems in Morris's marriage as Janey became increasingly close to Rossetti, who often painted her. It is unknown if their affair was ever sexual, although by this point other members of the group were noticing Rossetti and Janey's closeness. Morris also hired various servants, four of whom were cited as living in the house in the 1861 census; the cook Charlotte Cooper, the housemaid Jane Chapman, the nanny Elizabeth Reynolds, and the groom Thomas Reynolds.\nMorris added to both the house's interior and the design of the garden intermittently over the years, aided by his various friends. There was to be no wallpaper anywhere in the house, with the walls instead being painted or covered by tapestries. The walls of the staircase were intended to feature a painted mural by Burne-Jones depicting scenes from the Trojan War, while on the wall of the hall beneath was intended to be a picture of warships carrying the ancient Greek soldiers to Troy. Although depicting scenes from Classical mythology, Morris had wanted the designs to be Medieval in style, with the warships being based on those of the fourteenth century. On the hallway cupboard, Morris began (although never finished) a painting based on Thomas Malory's tale of how Sir Lancelot brought Sir Tristan and La Belle Iseult to the castle of the Joyous Garde. The figures themselves are depictions of some of Morris' friends, among them Jane, Faulkner, the Burne-Joneses, and Lizzie Siddel. In the dining room, Morris planned to decorate the walls with a series of embroidered female heroines, based in Geoffrey Chaucer's The Legend of Good Women. Produced by Jane and her sister Bessie, only seven or eight were completed.\nAround the walls of the drawing room, Morris had wanted a mural featuring a series of scenes from the fifteenth-century Middle English romance of Sir Degrevant. Ultimately, three were executed by Burne-Jones, and survive today; they feature Morris as king and Jane as queen. Over the fireplace, Morris had inscribed a Latin motto, \"Ars longa vita brevis\", meaning \"Life is short, but art endures.\" The settle from Red Lion Square was installed here, on top of which was fashioned a minstrels' gallery designed for Christmas concerts.\nDesigns were pricked into the ceilings and then painted with simple, bold patterns. Commenting on the designs being introduced by his friend, in February 1862 Burne-Jones wrote that \"Top [i.e. Morris] thrives through bandy, and is slowly making Red House the beautifullest place on Earth.\"\n\nIt was while living at Red House, in April 1861, that Morris co-founded a decorative arts company, Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co., with six other partners: Burne-Jones, Rossetti, Webb, Ford Madox Brown, Charles Faulkner, and Peter Paul Marshall. Operating from a premises at No. 6 Red Lion Square, they referred to themselves as \"the Firm\" and were intent on adopting Ruskin's ideas of reforming British attitudes to production. They hoped to reinstate decoration as one of the fine arts and adopted an ethos of affordability and anti-elitism. For additional staff, they employed boys from the Industrial Home for Destitute Boys in Euston, central London, many of whom were trained as apprentices. Although working within the Neo-Gothic school of design, they differed from Neo-Gothic architects like Gilbert Scott who simply included certain Gothic features on modern styles of building; instead they sought to return completely to Medieval Gothic methods of craftmanship.\nThe products created by the Firm included furniture, architectural carving, metalwork, stained glass windows, and murals. Their stained glass windows proved a particular success in the firm's early years as they were in high demand for the surge in the Neo-Gothic construction and refurbishment of churches, many of which were commissioned by the architect George Frederick Bodley. Despite Morris's anti-elitist ethos, the Firm soon became increasingly popular and fashionable with the bourgeoisie, particularly following their exhibit at the 1862 International Exhibition in South Kensington, where they received press attention and medals of commendation. However, they faced much opposition from established design companies, particularly those belonging to the Neo-Classical school.\nAlthough the Firm was becoming more successful, it did not generate large profits in its early years. Mackail suggests that as a result, the Morris family were placed under increasing financial strain as they attempted to retain the lavish lifestyle to which they had become accustomed. Morris was also considering expanding operations at Upton by moving the Firm's workshops to the village. As part of this, he formulated a plan for a second wing of Red House to be constructed, to house the Burne-Jones family. Although Burne-Jones agreed and together they began to organise the design of the new house, these were disrupted when Georgiana contracted scarlet fever, resulting in the miscarriage of her second child. The plans were subsequently scrapped. It has been suggested that Burne-Jones may also have been loath to move from London at the time because his artistic career was becoming increasingly successful, and most of his contacts within the art world were in the city. Morris was deeply disappointed with this, writing to Burne-Jones: \"As to our palace of art, I confess your letter was a blow to me at first, though hardly an unexpected one: in short I cried, but I have got over it now; of course I see it from your point of view\".\n\n\n=== Leaving Red House: 1865 ===\n\nWith the collapse of his ideas regarding Upton becoming the base for the Firm's operations, Morris began to recognise various problems with the property. Being north-facing, the interior of the house was cold during winter, which aggravated Morris' various medical conditions, and its isolated location made it difficult for doctors to visit. The three-mile commute by carriage from the house to Abbey Wood railway station over an exposed and windy plateau further aggravated him, as did the daily commute from Abbey Wood to the Firm's offices in Bloomsbury, which took up three to four hours a day.\nAlthough various authors on the subject have asserted that there were financial considerations encouraging Morris to leave, it has been established that in 1865 Morris' dividends from his shares were higher than at any point since 1857.\nMorris decided to move out of Red House and sell the property rather than rent it out, although no immediate purchaser appeared. He moved with his family to Queen Square in Bloomsbury in autumn 1865. Those pieces of furniture which proved too difficult to move to their new abode were left in Red House, where some of them are still present.  Morris never returned to visit the Red House, commenting that the sight of it would be too emotional for him. Nevertheless, Mackail described the five years that Morris lived at Red House as being \"probably the happiest and not the least fruitful of his life.\"\n\n\n== After Morris ==\nMorris had been unable to find a buyer for Red House, and agreed to let it for Â£95 per annum to a retired commander in the Indian Navy named James Arnold Heathcote (1827â1877), who moved into the house in spring 1866. Having served at the siege of Multan, Heathcote had gone on to become a specialist in maritime surveying, marrying Eliza Margarita Burton and with her having two children, Marion and Rennie. After retirement he returned to England, moving to Red House with two servants. They also purchased pieces of Morris' furniture that were in the house; two of Morris' chairs remained in the Heathcote family until 1997, when they were sold at Christie's auction house in London to the Delaware Art Museum in Wilmington. After Heathcote's death at the House, it was purchased from Morris by a wealthy stockbroker, Edmund Charlesworth (1831â1890), who lived there from 1879 to 1889 with his wife Marta and daughter Laura. The Charlesworth family decorated the house's studio with Morris' \"Daisy\" wallpaper, which remains in place to the present.\n\nIn 1889 Charlesworth sold the Red House for Â£2,900 to Charles Holme (1848â1923), who remained owner until 1903. Holme had become prosperous through a woollen business in Bradford before expanding into the Asian goods trade and by the 1880s he was employed as a buyer for the Liberty department store. Married to Clara Benton, they had three daughters and a son, who moved with him to the House. Holme admired Morris, and it was here in 1893 that he founded the arts magazine, The Studio, which gave importance to the Arts and Crafts movement. The earliest photographs of Red House date from the period in which it was occupied by Holme. He also contributed to the development of the building by encouraging visitors to scratch their signatures into the window panes on the screen dividing the entrance hall from the gallery with either a diamond ring or glass-scratching implement. He collected over one hundred signatures here, from family members, friends, and visitors. Notable names include those of May Morris and Georgina Burne-Jones on their visit in 1897, and the names of Japanese visitors who were in London to collect a battleship docked on the River Thames; among the latter was the future Japanese Prime Minister SaitÅ Makoto. This would be a tradition continued by some of the later owners, with the latest engraving dating to 1952.\nIn 1903 the House was purchased by Henry Muff (1850â1910), a draper from Bradford who lived there with his wife Maude and their son Edward, who later became a noted architect. The Muffs were social activists involved in a number of progressive causes, with Maude being elected to Bexley Urban District Council in 1907, being the second woman in England to have been elected to a district council. In keeping with the fashions of the time, they introduced a lighter colour scheme throughout much of the House. Henry died at the house in 1910, although Maude continued to live there for another decade. In 1920, she began renting the property to Arthur James Sherwell (1863â1942), who had previously served as a Liberal Party member of parliament for Huddersfield from 1906 to 1918, positioning himself on the radical wing of the party. He moved to the House with his wife Amy Whadcoat, which they later purchased from Maude Muff.\nIn 1924, Sherwell sold Red House to Walter Scott Godfrey (1855â1936), the director of a wine and spirits merchant and an author on anti-theism who had been widowed two years previously. Of all the property's residents, he would live there for the shortest time, although he carried out one of the largest alterations, by removing the dividing wall between the downstairs waiting room and bedroom to create a study-cum-library and inserted a porthole window between this library and the Pilgrims' Rest, which was designed by his son, the architect Walter Hindes Godfrey. He lived at the house with his youngest daughter and three domestic servants, however he felt lonely at Red House and found its upkeep too expensive. In 1927 an Australian, Alfred Herbert Horsfall (1871â1944), purchased the house. A medical doctor, Horsfall had served as a medic in the British Army during the South African War, before moving to Britain and becoming a lecturer for the Social and Political Education League and staunch apologist for the British Empire. In the stock market crash of the early 1930s, Horsfall lost much of his money. He was unsuccessful in selling the House in 1932.\n\n\n=== Threats and the Hollambys: 1934â2002 ===\n\nHorsfall attempted to sell the house again in 1934, this time with Harrods; he put forward an asking price of Â£4,000. Many believed that the house would be demolished to make way for encroaching suburban development, so a campaign group emerged with the hope of preserving the house and donating it to The National Trust; founding a preservation committee, they launched an appeal to purchase the property, with Horsfall agreeing that he would be willing to sell it to them for Â£3,100. The group sought to raise this amount, gaining the support of writers like Rudyard Kipling, George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, and John Masefield, and architects Edwin Lutyens, Giles Gilbert Scott, Herbert Baker, and Raymond Unwin, as well as the former Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald.\nThey asserted that \"We realise that at the present time the public are interested in other and very different movements in architecture and industrial art. We are however confident that, for the sake of its association with the work of William Morris and his group, the importance of this house will be appreciated in the future, and its loss in this regard will be recognised as irreparable.\" By December 1934, the committee's appeal had only raised Â£550 and the Trust were unwilling to foot the rest of the bill. The committee returned the donations that had been offered. On learning of this, May Morris commented that \"That beautiful house is fated to have bad luck, it seems!\"\nThe House was purchased by a local estate agent, Thomas Curtis Hills (c.1883â1957), in 1935. Aware of the threats posed to the house, he moved into it with his wife, Beatrice Nellie Foster. In 1941, during the Second World War, the government's Assistance Board took control of the house's ground floor, using it as an office to aid those left homeless by the Blitz. Commenting on this situation, a visitor to the building, Prime Minister of New Zealand Peter Fraser, stated that \"I think Morris would be pleased to know that a house of his is being used for such a purpose. The house is being devoted to the service of the people and Morris was for the people all the time.\" An air raid shelter was constructed in the House's gardens for the use of the Assistance Board's staff. After the war, the House had fallen into a poor state and the Hills were keen to sell it. In 1950, they unsuccessfully attempted to sell it to the National Trust and then the Labour Party, before offering it for Â£5,000 to anyone \"willing to preserve it for the nation\". The same year, it was designated a Grade I [listed building] by English Heritage. At the same time, the wellhead in the garden, also designed by Webb, was given its own Grade I listing.\nThe couple moved out of the building in early 1951, and it was left empty for over a year; it was purchased for Â£3,500 by Richard \"Dick\" Toms (1914â2005) and Edward \"Ted\" Hollamby (1921â1999) in 1952.\n\nBoth architects working for the London County Council, Toms and Hollamby had a keen interest in Morris and embraced his socialist ideals, being members of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the British-Soviet Friendship Society. Deciding to share the property between themselves, they were only able to afford a mortgage with the aid of a loan from Toms' father-in-law; he only agreed to provide the loan if the house was owned in Toms' name, and thus Hollamby became Toms' tenant. Both architects had wives â Mary Toms and Doris Hollamby â and children, and thus both families moved into the building in 1952, dividing the rooms among themselves, with the old kitchen being used as a communal dining room. In 1954, a third architect, David Gregory Jones, joined them at the House, and together they set about renovating much of the property. In 1957 the Toms moved out, desiring to live closer to central London, and they were replaced by Jean and David Macdonald; Jean was an architect who worked alongside Ted Hollamby, while David was an accountant and woodworker. Rearranging the former ownership arrangements, the Macdonalds and Hollambys agreed to legally own half of the property each. However, in 1964 the Macdonalds left and the Hollambys assumed sole ownership of the House.\nIn 1953, the newly founded William Morris Society held its inaugural meeting at Red House, subsequently holding a garden party there in 1960 to commemorate its centenary. After his retirement in 1985, Ted Hollamby decided to open the House up to visitors, offering guided tours on one Sunday per month. As the number of those attending such tours grew, especially in the 1996 centenary of Morris' death, Hollamby began to search for a way of securing future public access. In 1998 he helped to establish the Friends of Red House, a group of individuals who were largely members of the Bexley Civic Society, and who helped to maintain the House and its gardens as well as give tours to visitors. Hollamby died in 1999, and his wife left Red House to move to a care home in 2002. \n\n\n=== The National Trust ===\nAfter Doris Hollamby put the house up for sale, an anonymous benefactor purchased it and donated it to the National Trust, who completed the purchase in 2003, with the Friends of Red House continuing to organise tours. Contributions from the William Morris Society and Bexley Council also aided the Trust in purchasing the building. It has since performed further restoration and research to restore the house as much as possible to its original condition. The house is open to the public, but not every day; guided tours must be advance-booked and unguided visits are available for limited periods. There is a tea room with a gift shop.\nIn November 2004, the National Trust organised a seminar titled \"Red House: Past and Future Lives\" at the Art Workers' Guild at which various specialists in the house presented papers on the subject.\nIn 2013, a previously unknown mural depicting five figures from the Book of Genesis was discovered in Morris' bedroom at the house. It was believed that it resembled the joint work of Morris, Burne-Jones, Rossetti, Siddal, and Ford Madox Brown; as a result, the building's property manager James Breslin described the mural as being \"of international significance\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nRed House information at the National Trust\nA tribute to Ted and Doris Hollamby's stewardship of Red House\nFriends of Red House"

    "wikipediaText": "Danson House is a Palladian mansion and a Grade I listed building at the centre of Danson Park, in Welling in the London Borough of Bexley, south-east London.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The Danson estates before Danson House ===\nThe earliest reference to the Danson estates can be found in an Archbishop's survey of 1284, in which seven of the Archbishop's tenants are cited as owning 17 acres of land at \"Densynton\". The Manor of Bexley was acquired by Henry VIII, and remained a part of the royal estates until James I sold it to John Spielman in an attempt to raise funds for the crown. On 1 March 1622 the Manor was bought by William Camden, who immediately granted it to Oxford University to fund a chair in History. In 1695 the estates were sold into private hands for the first time as an owner-occupied property.\nIn 1699 John Styleman, a director of the British East India Company, took up residence at Danson, the estates having been acquired on his behalf by his brother Francis two years earlier. Styleman began to develop the estates as a country seat, but left Danson shortly after the death of his wife Arabella at the property in 1717. In 1723 Styleman leased the property for 99 years to John Selwyn MP, a royal courtier, who improved and enlarged the estates a great deal before his death in 1751. The estate at this point included a mansion with five bedrooms, four living rooms, a nursery, kitchen and brewhouse, as well as an icehouse, elaborate water features, and an ornamental Chinese-style house.\n\n\n=== 1753â1800 ===\n\nJohn Styleman had died in 1734, his will stipulating that half the proceeds from the lease should go to his widow, Mary Styleman, and the other half to charities providing almhouses for 12 poor families in Bexley. On 10 July 1753 Selwyn's widow, also Mary, sub-let the property to Sir John Boyd, sugar merchant and vice-chairman of the British East India Company, and son of the St Kitts planter and slaveholder Augustus Boyd. By 1759 Boyd had taken over the lease and bought out the rest of the land added to the estates by Selwyn. However, he still had to pay Â£100 annuity to the charity established by Styleman's will, which owned half of the freehold. His offer of a permanent annuity in return for the charity's half of the freehold required an Act of Parliament, and as a result the Styleman Act was passed in 1762, and John Boyd thus became the sole owner of the entire estates, paving the way for extensive enlargement of the property and the construction of Danson House as it stands today.\n\nOriginally called Danson Hill, the Palladian villa was designed by leading architect Sir Robert Taylor (architect of the Bank of England), and constructed to the north of the older mansion. Work began on the house in 1763, and Boyd moved into the house around 1768 with his new wife Catherine. By the time of Boyd's death in 1800 it stood in the centre of over 600 acres (2.4 km2) of pleasure grounds and agricultural estate â over 200 acres (0.8 km2) of which today form Danson Park, the second largest public park in the London Borough of Bexley. Internal furnishings and decorations, including ornate chimney-pieces, were designed by William Chambers, a friend of Boyd's, and murals and paintings were produced for the house by artists such as Richard Wilson and Richard Corbould.\nThe landscape was designed and laid out from 1761 to 1763, by either Capability Brown or his assistant Nathaniel Richmond. At its centre is a large and picturesque 12-acre (49,000 m2) lake to the south of the house, on the site of the previous mansion, described by Edward Hasted in his History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent of 1797 as \"a most magnificent sheet of water so contrived as to seem a beautiful serpentine river, flowing through the grounds\". A small house with a spire, named Chapel House, was constructed to the south of Danson House, which has now been separated from the rest of the park by a motorway, but can still be seen today near the roundabout at Blendon.\n\n\n=== 1800âpresent ===\n\nAfter Sir John died in January 1800 (being buried in St Mary's churchyard, Lewisham), his son demolished the imposing wings containing kitchens and stables, and built the present stable block (design attributed to George Dance the Younger). He sold the estate in 1807 to John Johnston, a retired army captain of the 62nd Regiment of Foot and Freeman of the City of London. In 1829, it passed to Johnston's son Hugh. Hugh's daughter Sarah painted a number of watercolours of the interior in the 1860s with intricate detail, which were later of key use in the restoration of the interior. Hugh Johnston sold Danson to railway engineer Alfred Bean in 1862. Bean was the driving force behind the Bexleyheath Railway Company, and chairman of Bexley Local Board, and envisaged transforming the 582-acre (2.4 km2) estate into a residential suburb. Outlying areas were sold off for residential development according to Bean's will, but the house and 224 acres of the estate remained in Bean's family after his death in 1890, until the death of his widow in 1921, when it was auctioned, and eventually acquired by Bexley Urban District Council for Â£16,000 in 1924. The park was opened to the public in 1925 by Princess Mary, while the house was used for civil defence purposes during World War Two. Over time football pitches, tennis courts and a bowling green have been added, along with an open-air swimming pool in 1936 and the Boathouse and Cafe, open to the public in 1964. The park is now used extensively by the community.\nWhen the house was acquired by English Heritage in 1995, it was in a dangerously dilapidated condition, having been uninhabited since 1923, and was described by English Heritage as \"the most significant building at risk in London\". It was painstakingly restored in a ten-year Â£4.5m project by Purcell Miller Tritton architects. Bexley Heritage Trust, a local heritage charity, was involved in partnership with English Heritage from 2000 and completed the interior furnishing and fitting-out of the house prior to its reopening by Queen Elizabeth II in Spring 2005. The Danson Park grounds were also restored, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, in 2006. In 2016, the borough cancelled its grant to the Bexley Heritage Trust for the upkeep of the property, and the charity therefore withdrew to focus on Hall Place, and the house fell under direct management from the borough. The council has subsequently made Danson House the register office for Bexley Borough.\n\nThe house is now owned by English Heritage on a 999-year lease from 1997, and will eventually be managed by a trust. It is open to the public on selected viewing days. The estate's stable block is now a public house, the Danson Stables.\nThe house was used as a filming location for the 2017 historical TV drama Taboo, starring Tom Hardy.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nJardin, Ian Weir (2017).

    "wikipediaText": "The Crossness Pumping Station is a former sewage pumping station designed by the Metropolitan Board of Works's chief engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette and architect Charles Henry Driver. It is located at Crossness Sewage Treatment Works, at the eastern end of the Southern Outfall Sewer and the Ridgeway path in the London Borough of Bexley. Constructed between 1859 and 1865 by William Webster, as part of Bazalgette's redevelopment of the London sewerage system, it features spectacular ornamental cast ironwork, that Nikolaus Pevsner described as \"a masterpiece of engineering â a Victorian cathedral of ironwork\".\nIt is adjacent to Erith Marshes, a grazing marsh, the northern part of which is designated as Crossness Nature Reserve. This provides a valuable habitat for creatures ranging from moths to small amphibians and water voles.\n\n\n== Opening ==\nThe Southern Outfall Works, as the complex was originally called, was officially opened on 4 April 1865, by Edward, Prince of Wales, attended by Prince Alfred, the Duke of Cambridge, Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Archbishop of York and the Lord Mayor of London, and many other persons of rank.\nFollowing an address by Joseph Bazalgette, the Royal party toured the works and reservoirs, and the Prince then turned the wheel which started the engines and, as the Illustrated London News observed, \"a sensible vibration was felt throughout the building, showing that the enormous beams, lifting-rods and flywheels were in operation.\"\n\n\n== Operation ==\nAt Crossness, the incoming liquid was raised some 30 to 40 feet (9â12 m) by the application of four large steam driven pumps. The engines were of enormous size and power. They were built by James Watt & Co. to Joseph Bazalgette's designs and specification, and were named \"Victoria\", \"Prince Consort\", \"Albert Edward\" and \"Alexandra\".\n\nAt 11 revolutions per minute, 6 tons (approximately 1,500 imp gal or 6,800 L) of sewage per stroke per engine were pumped up into a 27-million-imperial-gallon (120,000 m3) reservoir, and was released into the Thames during the ebbing tide. The steam required to power these engines was raised by 12 Cornish boilers with single \"straight-through\" flues situated in the Boiler House to the south of the Engine House, and which consumed 5,000 tons of Welsh coal annually.\nThe Crossness Works merely disposed of raw sewage into the river seawards, and in 1882, a Royal Commission recommended that the solid matter in the sewage should be separated out, and that only the liquid portion remaining should be allowed, as a temporary measure, to pass into the river. In 1891, sedimentation tanks were added to the works, and the sludge was carried by steam boats and dumped further out into the estuary, at sea.\nDuring the 1880s, chemical engineer William Webster developed a system for the electrolytic purification of sewage (patent application filed on 22 December 1887; US patent awarded on 19 February 1889), trialled in 1888 at the Southern Outfall works which had been built by his father's firm over 20 years earlier.\nBy 1897, additional pumping capacity was needed, and four extra pumps operated by triple-expansion steam engines were installed in an extension, designed to fit in with Bazalgette's main engine house, to the north of the older building. Later, in 1899, a further increase in London's population necessitated an increase in the efficiency of the original Watt engines, and considerable alteration to their design was carried out by Goodfellow & Co of Hyde, Manchester, for London County Council. They were converted from simple to compound engines with the original single cylinders were augmented by high and intermediate pressure cylinders. The additional steam required was provided by replacing the earlier Cornish boilers by more efficient Lancashire boilers with double flues and in 1901, the improved engines were fully working.\nIn 1913, the triple expansion steam engines were replaced by diesel engines, which are still to be seen in the triple expansion engine house, and by 1956, the Watt-Goodfellow engines had been decommissioned, (Prince Consort having been temporarily put back in steam in 1953 to assist with draining the flooding of the eastern Royal Arsenal and Abbey Wood) and were left, with the rest of the ironwork, to rust and to vandals.\n\n\n== Restoration ==\n\nThe pumping station became a Grade I listed building in 1970 and will remain on the Heritage at Risk Register until the restoration is completed. The Crossness Engines Trust, a registered charity, was formed in 1987 to oversee the restoration project which was due to be completed in 2013. The four pumping engines are thought to be the largest remaining rotative beam engines in the world, with 52-ton flywheels and 47-ton beams.\nWhen the pumping station was decommissioned in the 1950s, it was not considered economic to dismantle the engines, as the cost of doing so far exceeded any scrap value. The more valuable metal items (made from brass), such as the engine oilers, much pipework, and even the handrails from the stairs, were removed. The remaining building and engines were left to decay and over the decades were subject to much vandalism.\nAs Prince Consort was the last steam engine decommissioned, in 1953, it is this engine on which the restoration activity has been concentrated. After fifteen years of effort, by 2003 the engine was in working order again and is run on the open days organised by the Trust. Work has since begun on the restoration of Victoria. \nWhen the buildings were abandoned, the pumps and culverts and all the subterranean areas below the Beam Engine House were filled with sand to reduce the risks from methane. This has meant that some 100 tons of this sand has had to be excavated from around and underneath the pumps before there was any hope of moving the beam and flywheel. There was also a large ingress of rain water, resulting in serious rusting of the engine parts.\nThe original boilers did not survive, and Prince Consort is now steamed by a small \"off the shelf\" boiler. While it only has a fraction of the steam capacity of the originals, this is not a problem as the engine no longer operates under load.\n\n\n=== Museum ===\nHaving received over Â£2 million in initial funding, including, in 2008, Â£1.5 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund, Â£150,000 from English Heritage and Â£700,000 in match funding from the Department for Communities and Local Government, work began at the site to build an access road, protect the buildings and to develop a museum. Financial and other support was also provided by Thames Water, Tilfen Land, the London Borough of Bexley and the City Bridge Trust.\nA further Â£1.5 million in funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund was secured in April 2015, the 150th anniversary of Crossness's official opening. This was to help fund a museum exhibition focused on the \"Great Stink\" of 1858 and the role of Crossness in improving London's sewerage system.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nThe 2003 BBC Series Seven Wonders of the Industrial World: The Sewer King episode featured a segment filmed in the pumping station.\nThe pumping station has been used as a filming location for the 2009 film Sherlock Holmes and for the 2011 BBC production of Michel Faber's The Crimson Petal and the White. The building was also used as the setting for the final mission of the video game The Getaway: Black Monday.  The pumping station is used as the interior of Gustafson's factory in the 2020 film Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey, and was the location for the 2021 revival of GamesMaster.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nAbbey Mills Pumping Stations â a pumping station for the Northern Outfall Sewer.\nMarkfield Beam Engine and Museum\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nCrossness Pumping Station â official website\nHistoric England. \"South east workshops â Grade II (1064216)\".

    "wikipediaText": "Keston Windmill  is a grade I listed Post mill in Keston, formerly in Kent and now in the London Borough of Bromley. The mill was built in 1716 and is conserved with its machinery intact but not in working order.\n\n\n== History ==\nKeston Windmill was built in 1716. William Ashby, the Westerham millwright fitted new sails and repaired the breast of the mill in December 1836. The mill was working by wind until either 1878 or 1900. In 1955, Kent County Council placed a preservation order on the mill. The mill was built to grind corn into flour. The mill is privately owned and preserved with its machinery intact, but not in working order. It is not generally open to the public.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nKeston Mill has a three-storey body on a single-storey roundhouse. The roundhouse enclosed the trestle and the date 1716 is carved on the main post. It had four double Patent sails carried on a cast-iron windshaft. The mill is winded by a tailpole. The wooden brake wheel drives a cast-iron wallower, which drives a cast-iron great spur wheel with wooden cogs. This drives two pairs of underdrift millstones in the breast of the mill. The mill also has a flour dresser (bolter). The bolter in Keston mill has been used as the model for a reconstructed bolter in Lowfield Heath Windmill, Charlwood, Surrey.\n\n\n== Millers ==\nJohn Ellis 1838\nThomas Ellis 1845\nMartin J Hoath 1845\nB Hoadley 1862\nReferences for above:-\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nWindmill World page on the mill."

    "wikipediaText": "The National Portrait Gallery (NPG) is an art gallery in London that houses a collection of portraits of historically important and famous British people. When it opened in 1856, it was arguably the first national public gallery in the world that was dedicated to portraits.\nThe gallery moved in 1896 to its current site at St Martin's Place, off Trafalgar Square, and adjoining the National Gallery. The National Portrait Gallery also has regional outposts at Beningbrough Hall in Yorkshire and Montacute House in Somerset. It is unconnected to the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh, with which its remit overlaps. The gallery is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.\n\n\n== Collection ==\n\nThe gallery houses portraits of historically important and famous British people, selected on the basis of the significance of the sitter, not that of the artist. The collection includes photographs and caricatures as well as paintings, drawings and sculpture. One of its best-known images is the Chandos portrait, the most famous portrait of William Shakespeare although there is some uncertainty about whether the painting actually is of the playwright.\nNot all of the portraits are exceptional artistically, although there are self-portraits by William Hogarth, Sir Joshua Reynolds and other British artists of note. Some, such as the group portrait of the participants in the Somerset House Conference of 1604, are important historical documents in their own right. Often, the curiosity value is greater than the artistic worth of a work, as in the case of the anamorphic portrait of Edward VI by William Scrots, Patrick Branwell BrontÃ«'s painting of his sisters Charlotte, Emily and Anne, or a sculpture of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in medieval costume. Portraits of living figures were allowed from 1969. In addition to its permanent galleries of historical portraits, the National Portrait Gallery exhibits a rapidly changing selection of contemporary work, stages exhibitions of portrait art by individual artists and hosts the annual BP Portrait Prize competition.\n\n\n== History and buildings ==\n\nThe three people largely responsible for the founding of the National Portrait Gallery are commemorated with busts over the former main entrance on St Martin's Place. At the centre is Philip Henry Stanhope, 4th Earl Stanhope, with his supporters on either side, Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay (to Stanhope's left) and Thomas Carlyle (to Stanhope's right). It was Stanhope who, in 1846 as a Member of Parliament (MP), first proposed the idea of a National Portrait Gallery. It was not until his third attempt, in 1856, this time from the House of Lords, that the proposal was accepted. With Queen Victoria's approval, the House of Commons set aside a sum of Â£2000 to establish the gallery. As well as Stanhope and Macaulay, the founder trustees included Benjamin Disraeli and Lord Ellesmere. It was the latter who donated the Chandos portrait to the nation as the gallery's first portrait. Carlyle became a trustee after the death of Ellesmere in 1857.\nFor the first 40 years, the gallery was housed in various locations in London. The first 13 years were spent at 29 Great George Street, Westminster. There, the collection increased in size from 57 to 208 items, and the number of visitors from 5,300 to 34,500. In 1869, the collection moved to Exhibition Road and buildings managed by the Royal Horticultural Society. Following a fire in those buildings, the collection was moved in 1885, this time to the Bethnal Green Museum. This location was ultimately unsuitable due to its distance from the West End, condensation and lack of waterproofing. Following calls for a new location to be found, the government accepted an offer of funds from the philanthropist William Henry Alexander. Alexander donated Â£60,000 followed by another Â£20,000, and also chose the architect, Ewan Christian. The government provided the new site on St Martin's Place, adjacent to the National Gallery, and Â£16,000. The buildings, faced in Portland stone, were constructed by Shillitoe & Son. Both the architect, Ewan Christian, and the gallery's first director, George Scharf, died shortly before the new building was completed. The gallery opened at its new location on 4 April 1896. The first extension, in 1933, was funded by Lord Duveen, and resulted in the wing by the architect Sir Richard Allison on a site previously occupied by St George's Barracks running along Orange Street.\nIn February 1909, a murderâsuicide took place in a gallery known as the \"Arctic Room\". In an apparently planned attack, John Tempest Dawson, aged 70, shot his 58-year-old wife, Nannie Caskie, from behind with a revolver, then shot himself in the mouth, dying instantly. His wife died in hospital several hours later. Both were American nationals who had lived in Hove for around 10 years. Evidence at the inquest suggested that Dawson, a wealthy and well-travelled man, was suffering from a persecutory delusion. The incident came to public attention in 2010 when the Gallery's archive was put on-line as this included a personal account of the event by James Donald Milner, then the Assistant Director of the Gallery.\nThe collections of the National Portrait Gallery were stored at Mentmore Towers in Buckinghamshire during the Second World War, along with pieces from the Royal Collection and paintings from Speaker's House in the Palace of Westminster.\n\n\n=== Early 21st century ===\nThe second extension was funded by Sir Christopher Ondaatje and a Â£12m Heritage Lottery Fund grant, and was designed by the London-based architects Edward Jones and Jeremy Dixon. The Ondaatje Wing opened in 2000 and occupies a narrow space of land between the two 19th-century buildings of the National Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery, and is notable for its immense, two-storey escalator which takes visitors to the earliest part of the collection, the Tudor portraits.\nIn January 2008, the Gallery received its largest single donation to date, a Â£5m gift from the US billionaire Randy Lerner.\nIn January 2012, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, announced the National Portrait Gallery as one of her official patronages. Her portrait was unveiled in January 2013. The gallery holds nearly 20 portraits of Harriet Martineau and her brother James Martineau, whose great-nephew Francis Martineau Lupton was the Duchess's great-great-grandfather.\nBodelwyddan Castle's partnership with the National Portrait Gallery came to an end in 2017 after its funding was cut by Denbighshire County Council.\nIn June 2017 it was announced that the NPG has been awarded funding of Â£9.4 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund towards its major transformation programme Inspiring People, the Gallery's biggest ever development. The Gallery had already raised over Â£7m of its Â£35.5m target. The building works were scheduled to start in 2020.\nIn October 2019, a group of semi-naked environmental campaigners were drenched in fake oil, in the Ondaatje Wing main hall, as part of a protest against BP's sponsorship of a collection of pieces in the gallery. The protest performance piece, which was entitled Crude Truth, involve a clothed protester reciting a monologue in which they called upon arts organisations to sever ties with companies \"funding extinction\". Three activists covered in black liquid lay down for about five minutes on a plastic sheet before standing up again, wiping themselves down with towels, and cleaning up after themselves. The action, which was applauded by onlookers, passed uninterrupted.\n\n\n=== Closure and refurbishment in 2020â2023 ===\n\nA major programme of refurbishment with the project name of \"Inspiring People\" led to the gallery's closure from 2020 to 2023. Some galleries closed by late May 2020, with full closure by July 2020. There were a number of planned exhibitions and collaborations around the UK to display parts of the collection while the gallery was closed. These included exhibitions starting at the York Art Gallery in 2021, the Holburne Museum, Bath (Tudor portraits, 2022), and museums in Liverpool, Newcastle, Coventry and Edinburgh, which later toured to other venues. Other partners included the National Trust, the National Maritime Museum and the National Gallery. In London, the shops and restaurants closed, but the Heinz Archive and Library remained open. Another programme, called \"Coming Home\", loaned portraits of individual people to museums in their home towns. Exhibitions also travelled to Japan, Australia and the United States.\nThe \"Inspiring People\" project \"comprises a comprehensive redisplay of the Collection from the Tudors to now, combined with a complete refurbishment of the building, the creation of new public spaces, a more welcoming visitor entrance and public forecourt, and a new state of the art Learning Centre\". The East Wing returned to being gallery space, with its own new street entrance.\nThe refurbishment cost Â£41 million, was designed by the architect Jamie Fobert and Purcell and the main contractor was Gilbert-Ash. It added new galleries, learning spaces, restaurants and a public forecourt. The gallery's main entrance was moved and features three new 4 m (13 ft) bronze doors  which carry 45 portraits of un-named women, drawn by Tracey Emin. \nThe gallery was reopened by the Princess of Wales on 20 June 2023 and she met Sir Paul McCartney whose photography exhibition was the first major show in the new space and viewed the Portrait of Omai by Sir Joshua Reynolds, which the gallery had just acquired jointly with the Getty Museum in Los Angeles, for Â£50 million.  The gallery reopened to the public on 22 June. In 2024 the Inspiring People project was short-listed for the RIBA Stirling prize.\n\n\n== Exterior busts ==\nIn addition to the busts of the three founders of the gallery over the entrance, the exterior of two of the original 1896 buildings are decorated with stone busts of eminent portrait artists, biographical writers and historians. These busts, sculpted by Frederick R. Thomas, portray James Granger, William Faithorne, Edmund Lodge, Thomas Fuller, The Earl of Clarendon, Horace Walpole, Hans Holbein the Younger, Sir Anthony van Dyck, Sir Peter Lely, Sir Godfrey Kneller, Louis FranÃ§ois Roubiliac, William Hogarth, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Sir Thomas Lawrence and Sir Francis Chantrey.\n\n\n== Finances and staff ==\nThe National Portrait Gallery is an executive non-departmental public body of the UK Government, sponsored by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.\nThe National Portrait Gallery's total income in 2007â2008 amounted to Â£16,610,000, the majority of which came from government grant-in-aid (Â£7,038,000) and donations (Â£4,117,000). As of 31 March 2008, its net assets amounted to Â£69,251,000. In 2008, the NPG had 218 full-time equivalent employees. It is an exempt charity under English law.\n\n\n== Directors ==\n1857â1895: Sir George Scharf KCB\n1895â1909: Sir Lionel Cust KCVO FSA â previously at the Department of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum, and from 1901 to 1927 filled the role of Surveyor of the King's Pictures\n1909â1916: Charles Holmes â later director of the National Gallery\n1917â1927: James Milner\n1927â1951: Henry Hake\n1951â1964: Charles Kingsley Adams\n1964â1967: David Piper â later director of the Fitzwilliam Museum and fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge (1967â1973), and first director of the Ashmolean Museum (1973â1985)\n1967â1973: Roy Strong\n1974â1994: John Hayes\n1994â2002: Charles Saumarez Smith\n2002â2015: Sandy Nairne CBE, FSA\n2015â June 2024: Nicholas Cullinan\n2024: Michael Elliott (interim)\n2024-: Victoria Siddall\n\n\n== Legal threat against Wikipedia volunteer ==\n\nOn 14 July 2009, the National Portrait Gallery sent a demand letter alleging breach of copyright against an editor-user of Wikipedia, who downloaded thousands of high-resolution reproductions of public domain paintings from the NPG website, and placed them on Wikipedia's sister media repository site, Wikimedia Commons. The gallery's position was that it held copyright in the digital images uploaded to Wikimedia Commons, and that it had made a significant financial investment in creating these digital reproductions. Whereas single-file low resolution images were already available on its website, the images added to Wikimedia Commons were re-integrated from separate files after the user \"found a way to get around their software and download high-resolution images without permission.\"\nIn 2012, the Gallery licensed 53,000 low-resolution images under a Creative Commons licence, making them available free of charge for non-commercial use.

    "wikipediaText": "Bridgewater House is a townhouse located at 14 Cleveland Row in the St James's area of London, England. It is a Grade I listed building.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest known house on the site was Berkshire House, built in about 1626â27 for Thomas Howard, second son of the Earl of Suffolk and Master of the Horse to Charles I of England when he was Prince of Wales. Howard was later created Earl of Berkshire.\nAfter being occupied by Parliamentarian troops in the English Civil War, used for the Portuguese Embassy, and inhabited by Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, the house was lived in by Charles II's mistress Barbara Villiers, who was made Duchess of Cleveland in 1670, following which the house was known as Cleveland House.  She refaced the old house and added new wings. After being owned for some years by a speculator, the house was sold in 1700 to John Egerton, 3rd Earl of Bridgewater, after which it passed by inheritance until 1948.\nCleveland House was re-designed in the Palazzo style by Sir Charles Barry in 1840. The rebuilding was completed and renamed in 1854 for Francis Egerton, 1st Earl of Ellesmere, heir of the 3rd Duke of Bridgewater. It is built in Bath stone with a slate roof in three storeys with a basement. \nThe building was damaged in the Second World War by a bomb in the street and was subsequently adapted for office use. It was sold by John Egerton, 6th Duke of Sutherland.  By 1979, it was the corporate head office of Tube Investments, the British engineering and metals conglomerate.\nIn 1981, Bridgewater House was purchased for Â£19 million and restored by Yiannis Latsis, a Greek shipping magnate, and it is still owned by his family.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Art collections ==\nGeorge Leveson-Gower, 2nd Marquess of Stafford had Cleveland House extended in 1803â1806 by architect Charles Heathcote Tatham to accommodate the Stafford Gallery (renamed the Bridgewater Gallery in Bridgewater House), where the collections of paintings of the Duke of Bridgewater and his nephew and heir George Leveson-Gower, 1st Duke of Sutherland (whose second son Ellesmere was) were on at least semi-public display.\nThe collection included about 70 paintings from the famous Orleans Collection, some of which are now in the Sutherland Loan to the National Gallery of Scotland. The collection was opened in 1803, and it could be visited on Wednesday afternoons over four, later three, months in the summer by \"acquaintances\" of a member of the family, or artists recommended by a member of the Royal Academy. \nThe painting Charles I Insulted by Cromwell's Soldiers, thought lost in a World War II air raid, was rediscovered in 2009.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe exterior appears as Marchmain House in the 1981 television adaptation of Brideshead Revisited and as Grantham House, the Crawleysâ London house, in the TV historical drama series Downton Abbey.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nStourton, James (2012).

    "wikipediaText": "The Royal Mews is a mews, or collection of equestrian stables, of the British royal family. In London these stables and stable-hands' quarters have occupied two main sites in turn, being located at first on the north side of Charing Cross, and then (since the 1820s) within the grounds of Buckingham Palace.\nThe Royal Mews, Buckingham Palace, includes an extensive display of royal carriages and other associated items, and is open to the public for much of the year. It is also a working part of the palace, where horses and people live and work, and where carriages and cars are in daily use supporting the work of the monarch as head of state.\nThe titular head of the Royal Mews is the Master of the Horse (one of the three great officers of the Royal Household). The executive head is the Crown Equerry, who lives on site and oversees the Royal Mews Department (which is a department of the Royal Household).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== At Charing Cross ===\n\nThe first set of stables to be referred to as a mews was at Charing Cross at the western end of The Strand. The royal hawks were kept at this site from 1377 and the name originates from the fact that they were confined there at moulting time (\"mew\" being derived from the French verb \"muer\", to moult).\nIn the Tudor Period, the Royal Stables were located in Lomesbury (present-day Bloomsbury). In 1534 they were destroyed by fire, whereupon the King, Henry VIII, decided to rebuild the Charing Cross mews as a stables (the hawks having been given alternative accommodation). It kept its former name when it acquired this new function. On old maps, such as the \"Woodcut\" map of London of the early 1560s, the Mews can be seen extending back towards the site of today's Leicester Square.\nWhen George I came to the throne in 1714 he brought with him to London the famous cream stallions which he was wont to use as Elector of Hanover. Bred at the Royal Stud at Hampton Court, these horses pulled state carriages in England for the next two hundred years (except for a hiatus during the Napoleonic wars when George III used black stallions in protest at the French occupation of Hanover).\n\nThe mews was rebuilt again in 1732 to the designs of William Kent, and in the early 19th century it was open to the public. This building was usually known as the King's Mews (or Queen's Mews when there was a woman on the throne), but was also sometimes referred to as the Royal Mews or the Royal Stables.\n\nKent's redesign was a classical building occupying the northern half of the site, with an open space in front of it that ranked among the few large ones in central London at a time when the Royal Parks were on the fringes of the city and most squares in London were garden squares open only to the residents of their surrounding houses.\nOn 15 June 1820, the Guards in the Royal Mews mutinied in support of Caroline of Brunswick, whom King George IV was seeking to divorce.\nThe whole site was cleared in the late 1820s to create Trafalgar Square, laid out in 1837â1844 after delays, and the National Gallery which opened in 1838.\n\n\n=== At Buckingham Palace ===\n\nThe present Royal Mews is in the grounds of Buckingham Palace, to the south of Buckingham Palace Gardens, near Grosvenor Place.\nIn the 1760s George III moved some of his day-to-day horses and carriages to the grounds of Buckingham House, which he had acquired in 1762 for his wife's use. The Riding School, thought to be by William Chambers, dates from this period (it was completed in 1764; the pediment, with sculptural motifs by William Theed, was added in 1859). The main royal stables housing the ceremonial coaches and their horses remained at the King's Mews, Charing Cross; however, when his son George IV had Buckingham Palace converted into the main royal residence in the 1820s the whole stables establishment was moved there.\n\nThe current Royal Mews was built to designs by John Nash and was completed in 1825 (though the mews buildings have been modified extensively since). The main quadrangle was laid out with coach houses on the east side, and stable blocks (alternating with harness and forage rooms) on the west. Beyond it, the 'back mews' included accommodation for a veterinary surgeon.\n\nWhen Victoria came to the throne in 1837, Buckingham Palace became the monarch's principal residence. Prince Albert used the back mews for stabling his own horses (for riding and driving). By the 1850s there were just under two hundred people employed at the mews, most of whom lived on site with their families. Standing either side of the entrance were official residences (one for the Crown Equerry, the other for the Clerk of the Stables); other staff were accommodated in rooms above the stables and carriage houses. In 1855 Queen Victoria established a Buckingham Palace Royal Mews School, for the education of the workers' children.\n\nUnder Victoria's successor, King Edward VII, motor vehicles were introduced into the mews. In 1904 the Crown Equerry wrote to the Office of Works to request the conversion of 'two small coach-houses in the Back Mews' into 'a suitable Motor House [...] with a Lantern roof, hot water heating apparatus and electric lighting'. The conversion duly took place, and accommodation was provided nearby for the chauffeurs.\n\nIn the early 20th century problems had arisen due to inbreeding of the Hanoverian creams. In 1920 they were withdrawn from use and in their place, for the rest of the decade, bay horses took pride of place in the Mews. In the early 1930s, however, King George V began using grey horses for the lead carriages in state and ceremonial processions; his son and heir Edward VIII moved the grey horses from Windsor (where they had been used for many years by the Royal Family for their private carriages) to London, where they were nicknamed the 'Windsor Greys'.\nBy 1936 motor vehicles were in the ascendency, and following his accession to the throne Edward VIII disposed of several of the more 'day to day' carriages. George VI made more disposals after the Second World War: for example, sixteen plain Edwardian town coaches were sold off at this time (just one remained, stored away at Windsor; it was later rediscovered, glazed and restored to royal use). A total of nineteen carriages were purchased by Sir Alexander Korda after the war, for use as film props; of these, five Clarences were borrowed back in 1953 for the coronation (to supplement five identical carriages which had been retained by the Mews). The coronation that year involved thirty-four coaches and carriages with seventy-eight horses in harness.\nIn 1988 a new state coach was presented to the Mews, the Australian State Coach, built by former Mews employee W. J. Frecklington as part of the Australian Bicentenary celebrations; it was the first new royal state coach to be built since the 1902 State Landau. At that time, despite the earlier disposals, the Royal Mews still had custody of over a hundred vehicles, with all but a dozen being in working order; the majority were in London or Windsor, with others spread around the other royal residences.\n\n\n== Present day ==\n\nAs well as being a full-time working facility, the Royal Mews, Buckingham Palace, is regularly open to the public. The state coaches and other carriages are kept there, along with about 30 horses, together with their modern counterparts: the state motor cars. Coachmen, grooms, chauffeurs and other staff are accommodated in flats above the carriage houses and stables.\n\n\n=== Carriage horses ===\nThe complement of horses in the Royal Mews today includes around a dozen Windsor Greys and eighteen Cleveland Bays. The horses are regularly exercised in the art of pulling carriages (which is one of the reasons for the continuing use of horse-drawn transport for the daily messenger rounds between Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace); they are used for competitive and recreational driving as well as for ceremonial duties. The manure that is produced by the horses is used by the adjacent Buckingham Palace Garden.\n\n\n=== Royal and state carriages ===\nA few of the carriages stored at the Mews are pictured here in action; several more are illustrated on their own pages (see listing below).\n\nVehicles in the care of the Royal Mews are listed below. A good number are on public display, though not all are kept in London. Most are in regular use, and some (for example, the broughams) are driven on a daily basis. Others (above all the Gold Coach) are only used on great and rare state occasions. The list includes vehicles for personal, recreational and sporting use, as well as those designed and kept for state occasions:\n\nThe Gold State Coach\nThe Irish State Coach\nThe Scottish State Coach\nThe Australian State Coach\nThe Diamond Jubilee State Coach\nQueen Alexandra's State Coach\nThe Glass Coach\nKing Edward VII's Town Coach\nSeveral landau carriages including:\nThe 1902 State Landau\nSeven other state landaus\nFive semi-state landaus\nFive Ascot landaus\nBarouches and sociables\nBroughams and clarences\nPhaetons and victorias\nSporting carriages, including a rare curricle\nRecreational vehicles, such as the Louis-Philippe charabanc (illustrated)\nA variety of pony carriages, drags and exercise vehicles\nIn less regular use is Queen Victoria's state sledge, one of a number of royal sleighs in the Mews.\nAlso on display are some of the historic and immaculately kept liveries and harnesses (which likewise see regular use), ranging from the plainer items used for exercising and working horses, to the ornamented state liveries and harnesses designed for use with the similarly appointed state coaches.\n\n\n=== Motor vehicles ===\n\nThe maintenance and provision of modern motor vehicles is as much a part of the work of the Royal Mews as that of carriages and horses. Edward VII first established a garage in the Mews in the early years of the twentieth century.\nThe principal official cars are all painted in black over claret (known as Royal Claret). They are driven, cared for and maintained by a number of chauffeurs, who are based in the Mews and work under the head chauffeur (who, along with his deputy, is primarily responsible for driving the monarch).\n\n\n==== State cars ====\n\nThe five principal state cars are without number plates. They comprise:\n\nTwo identical Bentley State Limousines (one was given to Queen Elizabeth II in 2002 to mark her Golden Jubilee, the other was purchased at the same time).\nTwo Rolls-Royce Phantom VI limousines: the 1978 Silver Jubilee Phantom VI and a 1986 Phantom VI, both nearly identical outwardly, save for the slightly higher roof on the 1978 example (see photo).\nA rare 1950 Rolls-Royce Phantom IV with body by HJ Mulliner & Co., the first example of this model built; it was fitted with an automatic gearbox in 1955.\n\n\n==== Other official vehicles ====\nThe following vehicles, used for less-formal occasions and as support vehicles, are similarly painted in the royal claret and black livery:\n\nThree Daimler DS420 limousines, two dating from 1992 (number plates KLL1 and K326EHV) and one from 1988 (F728OUL).\nTwo 2012 Jaguar XJ limousines (number plates NGN 1 and NGN 2).\nThree 2022 Range Rovers (number plates MYT1, MYT 2 and MYT 3).\nThe State Hearse commissioned for the funeral of Elizabeth II.\nLand Rovers, luggage brakes and people carriers are also kept at the Royal Mews. A number of electric vehicles have been acquired since 2012, for various purposes, ranging from a BMW i3 and a BMW 7 Series hybrid to a Nissan van and a Renault Twizy.\n\n\n=== The Royal Mews Department ===\nThe following chart shows the staff structure of the Royal Mews Department at the end of the twentieth century (when around fifty people lived and worked at the Mews). The position of Superintendent, which included oversight of the staff of the Mews, was abolished in 2000.\n\n\n== Other locations ==\n\nThe Royal Mews, Hampton Court Palace overlooks Hampton Court Green. It continues to provide accommodation for royal staff, and horses are stabled there from time to time. It is not open to the public.\nThere is a working Royal Mews at Windsor Castle where the Ascot carriages are normally kept, together with vehicles used in Windsor Great Park. Some horses for riding (rather than driving) are also stabled here.\nAt Holyrood, the Royal Mews (situated in Abbey Strand) is one of the oldest parts of the Palace, and is still pressed into service whenever royal carriages are used in Edinburgh.\nHistorically, the old stables of St James's Palace, which stood where Lancaster House is now, were also sometime referred to as the Royal Mews.\n\n\n== See also ==\nJapan state carriages\nRoyal Stables (Denmark)\nRoyal Stables (Sweden)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website \nRoyal Mews at Buckingham Palace, London.

C.11 and C.12 remains;\nHenry III's  mid C.13  rebuild;  C.14  and C.16  work;  and C.17  to C.19\nalterations and restorations for the Collegiate Church and School, with war\ndamage repair/rebuilding.  Principally stone with Reigate stone and Purbeck\nmarble for C.13/C.14 work, brick for some of C.17 and later alterations;\nslate, tile and leaded roofs.  The Cloister begun c.1245-50 in north-east\ncorner,  contemporary  with  the  church,  completed  in  1366  with  the\nconstruction of the south and west walls; restored by Blore and Scott.\nQuadripartite vaults  for the last phase;  blind arcading to walls and\ntraceried windows to the garth between buttresses.   St. Faith's Chapel\nabuts  the south transept and was built c.1250, 2 bays to west and one to\neast, very fine blank arcading and rib-vaults with head-corbels; a gallery\non tunnel vault at west end formerly linked with the Dormitory over the\nChapter House vestibule and the night stair in the south transept.  The\nChapter House of c.1245-53 (restored by Scott) opens off the east Cloister\nwalk via inner and outer vestibules; very pure Geometrical  Gothic, built on an\noctagonal plan, over crypt, with central cluster-shaft pier carrying rib-vault\n(rebuilt  by  Scott);   innovatory,   large   4-light,   quatrefoiled  and\nfoiled-circle-crowned  windows (cf the nave at Amiens and the virtually contemporary.\nSainte Chapelle); flying buttresses added C14; leaded tent-lantern roof on iron frame by\nScott; mid C13 tiled pavement; blank, Purbeck shafted, arcading with remains of mid C14 paintings; Clayton\nand Bell glass.

To the west Nos. 1\nand 2 the Cloisters flank the south side of the Parlour, now the passage\ncontinuing the south Cloister walk into Dean's Yard:  of later C.14 build,\nin 2 parts each of 2 bays with tierceron vaults; above, what was probably\nthe Abbot's Camera; rubble walls stone dressed with gable end tiled roof to\neastern half with partly original windows, 2 to north and one in east gable\nend; the western half much rebuilt C.18/C.19 in upper parts, has front to\nDean's  Yard  with  3  storey  crenellated  tower  over  Parlour  entrance,\nextending to south with lower 3-storey, 3-window wide range:  the northern\npart  of  the Cellarer's Building  (see  also No. 20  Dean's  Yard,  Broad\nSanctuary); large shafted 2 centred arched doorway, with C.18 gate, to the\nParlour, large 2-light Y-tracery window above and 2 and 3 light mullioned\nwindows to right.  The Dormitory range, terminating in remains  of the\nReredorter, lies south of the Chapter House flanked initially by part of\nthe east Cloister walk continued by the Dark Cloister. The Dormitory\nretains its later C.11 vaulted undercroft with the Pyx Chapel at the north\nend and the remainder used as a Museum; at the north end of the range the\nC.13 Day-stairs give access, off the south east corner of the Cloister, to\nthe Chapter Library fitted out c.1620 like a college library with presses\nwith some strapwork cresting, the heavy, plain, hammerbeam roof probably\nC.14.  The rest of the dormitory range at 1st floor level is now occupied\nby \"School\" of Westminster School, refaced in brick by Benjamin Wyatt in\n1814 and largely rebuilt after war damage;it nevertheless incorporates C.11\nfeatures with Norman doorway in west wall and window remains in east wall;\nat the south end and partly incorporating remains of the Reredorter, is the\nBusby Library of c.1655-60, rebuilt after war damage  (for staircase and\ngateway to \"School\" and Busby Library, see Little Dean's Yard); on the east\nside of the Dormitory projects the early C.16 St. Dunstan's Chapel above\nwhich is a chamber with square headed Perpendicular windows and a C.18\nVenetian window; the outer east wall of the Dormitory is partially exposed\ninside the adjoining school gymnasium with blocked medieval windows of\ndifferent shapes and date.   The Dark Cloister is the vaulted passage\nbetween the  surviving walls of the Refectory and the Dormitory,  C.11\ncontiguous with a late C.14 wall on the west side with a long timber window\nof 20 mullioned lights, debouching into Little Dean's Yard.R.C.H.M.\nLondon Vol I, N Pevsner \nListing NGR: TQ3005079461\n        \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n    \n        Legacy\n    \n    \n        The contents of this record have been generated from a legacy data system.\n    \n    \n        \n            Legacy System number:\n            \n                208830\n            \n        \n        \n            Legacy System:\n            \n                LBS\n            \n        \n    \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n                    Sources\n                \n                \n                    Books and journalsInventory of London I Westminster Abbey, (1924)Pevsner,  N, Cherry,  B, The Buildings of England: London I - The Cities of London and Westminster, (1973)\n                \n\n\n\n                    \n                        \n\n\n    \n        Legal\n    \n\n\n    \n        This building is listed under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as amended for its special architectural or historic interest.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n\n            \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n            \n                Map\n            \n            \n                This map is for quick reference purposes only and may not be to scale.

    "wikipediaText": "St Margaret's Church or the Church of St Margaret of Antioch is a Church of England parish church in Barking, East London. The church is a Grade I listed building, on a site dating back to the 13th century, within the grounds of the Roman Catholic Barking Abbey, the ruins of a former royal monastery that was originally established in the 7th century. The building is dedicated to Margaret the Virgin, also known as Margaret of Antioch.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Medieval ===\nThe church originated as a Roman Catholic chapel for local people within the grounds of Barking Abbey, to the south of the Abbey church. Its oldest part is the chancel, built early in the 13th century during the reign of King John. The building is said to have been made into a parish church in 1300 by Anne de Vere, abbess of the Abbey. Until the 1390s Barking formed a rectory, held by the Abbey and divided into two vicarages known as 'Northstrete' (probably funded by income from the Ilford area) and 'Southstrete' (serving the Abbey church). The area suffered severe flooding in the late 14th century, leading to financial difficulties and a merger of the two vicarages from 1398 onwards. A chaplain from the Abbey led worship. The present bell tower was added late in the 15th century.\n\n\n=== Reformation ===\nIt remained a parish church when the Abbey was dissolved and the rectory and advowson devolved to the Crown, who initially leased it to the widow Mary Blackenhall for 21 years in 1540. In 1557 these were bought by Robert Thomas and Andrew Salter using money from the estate of William Pownsett of nearby Loxford, and granted to All Souls College, Oxford, in return for the vicar praying for the souls of Pownsett, his parents and benefactors every Sunday, giving 6 shillings and 8 pence amongst twenty poor people annually on the anniversary of Pownsett's death, paying the College an annual sum to maintain two poor scholars and only being absent from the parish 80 or fewer days a year. The College presented when the next vacancy occurred in 1560, but at the following one the Crown contested its right, though this was overturned via a lawsuit. Sir John Petre reconfirmed the 1557 grant in 1594, but dropped the requirement to pray for the dead. The right is now shared between All Souls College, Oxford, the Bishop of Chelmsford (in whose diocese it now falls) and the church's churchwardens.\n\n\n=== 17th century to 20th century ===\n\nThe church contains several memorials, including one to the 17th-century politician Charles Montagu. The explorer Captain James Cook married Elizabeth Batts in the church on 21 December 1762. Ten years later the nave, chancel and sanctuary all had their ceilings plastered, though this was removed from the nave ceiling in 1842.\nCharles Winmill and George Jack were involved in a restoration of the interior between 1929 and 1936. The building was Grade I listed in 1954. An extension was added along the south side late in the 20th century to provide an office, bookshop and refectory.\n\n\n== Present day ==\nIn the late 1970s the parish became part of a team parish covering Barking with Christ Church and St Patrick's. On 1 January 2017, St Patrick's and Christchurch each gained their own parishes, taken from the team Parish area, leaving St Margaret's with a smaller Parish.\nSt Margaret's parish is unusual in having three churchwardens rather than two.\nIn 2007, two small stones from remains of the old medieval London Bridge were joined together in a sculpture in front of St Margaret's church facing the Barking Abbey ruins as part of several public artworks placed in Barking Town Centre by artist Joost Van Santen.\nThe church is both Anglo-Catholic and open evangelical in tradition.\n\n\n== Notable clergy ==\nMany vicars of Barking have gone on to become bishops. Hugh Jermyn was Bishop of Colombo 1871â1875,  Bishop of Brechin 1875â1903 and Primus of Scotland 1886â1901. Robin Smith, a curate from 1962, was Bishop of Hertford 1990â2001.\n\n\n=== Vicars of North Barking ===\n1315-????: Martinus\n1328-????: ???? De Ansi\n1335-???: ????

Her father, Samuel Batts, was keeper of the Bell Inn in Wapping and one of Cook's mentors.\n\n\n=== Burials ===\nDaniel Day (1682â1767), founder of the Fairlop Fair, was buried in a coffin made from a bough which fell from the Fairlop Oak. Fairlop was, at that time,  part of the ancient parish of Barking.\nHenry Fanshawe (1506â1568), a  Member of the English Parliament during the reign of Elizabeth I. He also served as Queen's Remembrancer from 1565 until his death in 1568.\nSir Charles Montagu (c.1564â1625) of Cranbrook Hall in the parish of Barking, Essex, a politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1614 to 1625. He was buried in the church where a mural monument survives, depicting a small effigy of Sir Charles fully armed, sitting in a military tent during a campaign. Its inscription reads:\nHeere lieth the body of ye worthy knight Sr Charles Montagu who died at his house at Cranbrook in Essex in the parish of Barking the 11th of September in ye yeere of our Lorde God 1625 being of ye age of 61 yeares who gave to ye poore of Barking forty pounds\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website"

    "wikipediaText": "St Mary-at-Hill is a Church of England parish church in the Ward of Billingsgate, City of London. It is situated on Lovat Lane, a cobbled street off Eastcheap. \nIt was founded in the 12th century as \"St Mary de Hull\" or \"St Mary de la Hulle\". It was severely damaged in the Great Fire of London in 1666. It was only partially rebuilt and has been much altered since, although some of its mediaeval fabric survives. Following the closure of three neighbouring churches, her parish is now called \"St Mary-at-Hill with St Andrew Hubbard, Eastcheap; St George, Botolph Lane; and St Botolph by Billingsgate\".  The congregation of St Anne's Lutheran Church shares St Mary-at-Hill with its Anglican congregation.\nThe Church of St Mary-at-Hill is situated among some of the city's most ancient lanes: St Mary at Hill EC3, in which has a large double-faced clock extending several feet into the street and which provides the best view of the church's elegant exterior; a narrow alleyway running alongside, but with no right of way; and, its entrance on Lovat Lane EC3, its postal address.\n\n\n== History and architecture ==\nSt Mary-at-Hill dates to 1336. The north aisle was rebuilt at the end of the 15th century, and a south aisle and steeple were added a little later. John Stow, writing at end of the 16th century, described it as \"the fair church of Saint Marie, called on the Hill, because of the ascent from Billingsgate\".\n\nThe Great Fire of 1666 started in the neighbouring street of Pudding Lane severely damaging the church. After the blaze, the parish of St Mary's was united with that of St Andrew Hubbard, whose church was not rebuilt.\nSir Christopher Wren rebuilt the church's interior and east end, managing to retain its medieval walls on the other three sides, and the west tower to which he added a lantern. Wren included in his design a venetian window at the east end, now blocked up, and a pediment, now broken. His interior displays four free-standing corinthian columns, supporting barrel vaults in a Greek cross pattern, and a coffered central dome. The church is 96 ft long and 60 ft wide.\nA hoard of coins (now known as the Mary Hill Hoard) was found in a basement near St Mary-at-Hill in the 18th century. The hoard included the only known example of a coin from the Horndon mint.\nThere have been considerable further alterations since the 17th century. In 1787â88, George Gwilt rebuilt the west wall and replaced the tower in brick and in 1826â27 James Savage installed round-headed iron-framed windows in the north wall and replaced the vaults, ceilings and plasterwork. In 1848â49 he added a cupola to the dome and cut windows through the chancel vault. In 1849, the 17th century woodwork was sympathetically augmented and adapted by W. Gibbs Rogers. In 1904 the church's parish was united with that of St George Botolph Lane (to which had already been united St Botolph Billingsgate), and St Mary-at-Hill received the sword rests, plate, royal arms, ironwork, organ and organ case from St George. In 1939, the writer Dornford Yates used the church as a setting for some of the action in his thriller Gale Warning, calling it âSt. Ivesâ. Use is made of the open-work screens on the roof.\nThe church survived the Blitz in the Second World War unscathed, but was severely damaged by a fire in 1988, after which its roof and ceiling required rebuilding. At first it was proposed to make the church redundant, but a full restoration was soon promised and the roof, the plaster vaults and the dome were put back in 1990â91. Most of the interior fittings and woodwork survived the fire and were not destroyed. To date, the interior otherwise remains a bleak shell as the fine woodwork which includes the pulpit, reredos and other pieces of furniture, have not been reinstated and remain in storage even though the church has been in use again for two decades, despite pressure from preservationists and the Georgian Group. \nWriting before St Mary's 1988 fire, John Betjeman said of the church: \"This is the least spoiled and the most gorgeous interior in the City, all the more exciting by being hidden away among cobbled alleys, paved passages, brick walls, overhung by plane treesâ¦\"\nThe church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950. On the street St Mary at Hill, there is an adjacent Grade II brick and stone rectory of 1834 designed by James Savage, incorporating a vestry of the late 17th century.\n\n\n== Music and traditions ==\n\nFrom 1510 the Chapel Royal choir sang here. The organ-builder Mighaell Glocetir worked at St Mary-at-Hill from 1477 to 1479. He is possibly the same person as Myghell Glancets who worked on St Michael, Cornhill, in 1475.\nThe composer Thomas Tallis was organist at St Mary-at-Hill between 1538â1539.\nA William Hill organ was installed in 1848 and partly restored after the 1988 fire, but its complete restoration did not commence until 2000. The church is a popular venue for its regular concerts and recitals.\nIn several books on English folklore, or about ceremonies of London, there is mention of the Costermongers' Festival held here every October. It also goes by the name \"Fish Harvest Festival\" or \"Harvest of the Sea\", associated with the fishmarket that was held at Billingsgate. Another notable ceremony is Beating the Bounds, where notables and children process around the boundary of a parish or ward on Ascension Day, carrying slender rods. Originally the children were whipped (not severely) at points along the route. Almost every such example died out in the middle of the 19th century, but the account books of St Mary-at-Hill testify to its existence here. Four shillings were paid for the provision of fruit on the day of the \"Perambulation\" in 1682. In another example at Chelsea the whipped children were given four pence. Rare surviving examples of Beating the Bounds are at the nearby City Church of All Hallows-by-the-Tower (every three years), and at The Queen's Chapel of The Savoy, Westminster.\n\n\n== Burials ==\n\nParliament outlawed new burials in the City of London during the Victorian era, forcing the closure of its churchyards; in 1847 the Church purchased burials rights 'in perpetuity' in a small section of the consecrated ground at West Norwood Cemetery for the parish's own use. It stood out from the main cemetery through its railed enclosure and planting, including monkey puzzle trees.\nThe London Borough of Lambeth subsequently compulsorily-purchased the main cemetery and removed the memorials in this section during 1990â91. A subsequent Chancery Court hearing found this to be illegal and ordered a mechanism be set up to restore those monuments at the request of descendants.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nRichard Beearde, hymn writer, was Rector of St Mary-at-Hill, 1560â1574\nEdward Young, poet and author of Night Thoughts, was married at St Mary-at-Hill in 1731\nSarah Elizabeth Utterson, translator and author, was born in 1781 in the parish\nJohn Brand, an antiquarian, was appointed Rector of St Mary-at-Hill in 1784\nWilliam Turner Alchin, another antiquarian, was born 1790 in the parish\nWilson Carlile, founder of the Church Army, was a minister at the church in the late 19th/early 20th century\nRose Hudson-Wilkin, the previous priest-in-charge, was also Chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons and is now, at November 2019, Bishop of Dover, the first black woman to be consecrated a bishop in the Church of England.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of churches and cathedrals of London\nList of Christopher Wren churches in London\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nThe Parish Church of St Mary-at-Hill, Eastcheap\nChapel Royal (authorisation required)\nBritish Institute of Organ Builders Medieval builders\nThomas Tallis\nThe medieval records of a London City church â St Mary at Hill, 1420â1559\nwww.private-eye.co.uk, Jan 2014\n360Â° panorama inside St Mary-at-Hill"

    "wikipediaText": "St Magnus the Martyr, London Bridge, is a Church of England church and parish within the City of London. The church, which is located in Lower Thames Street near The Monument to the Great Fire of London, is part of the Diocese of London and under the pastoral care of the Bishop of Fulham. It is a Grade I listed building. The rector uses the title \"Cardinal Rector\" and, since the abolition of the College of Minor Canons of St Paul's Cathedral in 2016, is the only cleric in the Church of England to use the title cardinal.\nSt Magnus lies on the original alignment of London Bridge between the City and Southwark. The ancient parish was united with that of St Margaret, New Fish Street, in 1670 and with that of St Michael, Crooked Lane, in 1831. The three united parishes retained separate vestries and churchwardens. Parish clerks continue to be appointed for each of the three parishes.\nSt Magnus is the guild church of the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers and the Worshipful Company of Plumbers, and the ward church of the Ward of Bridge and Bridge Without. It is also twinned with the Church of the Resurrection in New York City.\nIts prominent location and beauty have prompted many mentions in literature. In Oliver Twist, Charles Dickens notes how, as Nancy heads for her secret meeting with Mr Brownlow and Rose Maylie on London Bridge, \"the tower of old Saint Saviour's Church, and the spire of Saint Magnus, so long the giant-warders of the ancient bridge, were visible in the gloom\". The church's spiritual and architectural importance is celebrated in the poem The Waste Land by T. S. Eliot, who wrote, \"the walls of Magnus Martyr hold/Inexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold\". He added in a footnote that \"the interior of St. Magnus Martyr is to my mind one of the finest among Wren's interiors\". One biographer of Eliot notes that at first he enjoyed St Magnus aesthetically for its \"splendour\"; later he appreciated its \"utility\" when he came there as a sinner.\n\n\n== Dedication ==\nThe identity of the St Magnus to whom the church is dedicated is disputed. It is now dedicated to St Magnus Erlendsson, Earl of Orkney, who died in 1116 or 1117. However, scholarly opinion is increasingly coming to the conclusion that the original dedication was to St Magnus of Anagni, a 2nd-century Italian saint whose cult was widespread.\n\nSt Magnus of Orkney was executed on the island of Egilsay on 16 April in 1116 or 1117 (the year is uncertain), having been captured during a power struggle with his cousin, a political rival. Magnus had a reputation for piety and gentleness and was sanctified (a form of unofficial canonisation) in 1136. St Ronald, the son of Magnus's sister Gunhild Erlendsdotter, became Earl of Orkney in 1136 and in 1137 initiated the construction of St Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall.\n\nThe London church was not linked to St Magnus of Orkney before the 18th century, when it was suggested that it was either \"dedicated to the memory of St Magnus or Magnes, who suffer'd under the Emperor Aurelian in 276 [this appears to be a reference to St Mammes of Caesarea, whose feast day is on 17 August], or else to a person of that name, who was the famous Apostle or Bishop of the Orcades.\"\nFor the next century most historians followed the suggestion that the church was dedicated to the Roman saint of CÃ¦sarea. However, in the mid-19th century the prominent Danish archaeologist Professor Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae (1821â85) instead promoted the association with Magnus of Orkney, during his visit to the British Isles in 1846â47, when he was formulating the concept of the \"Viking Age\", and then in his Account of the Danes and Norwegians in England, Scotland, and Ireland of 1852. This theory immediately found its way into both guides and academic works. The discovery of Magnus of Orkney's relics in 1919 increased interest in a Scandinavian patron and this connection was encouraged by the rector who arrived in 1921. The dedication to St Magnus of Orkney was confirmed by the Bishop of London in 1926. Following this decision a patronal festival service was held on 16 April 1926. The 900th anniversary of the death of St Magnus was marked with a Pontifical High Mass and Solemn Pontifical Vespers at the London church on 16 April 2016 (although it was to be celebrated in 2017 at St Magnus Cathedral in Orkney).\n\nThe principal argument against an association with Magnus of Orkney is that the original church pre-dated his sanctification by around a century, and was also probably constructed before the cult of St Olaf, which did not become established in London until the 1050s. The dedication of the church to St Magnus (as for the four City churches dedicated to St Botolph) at least partly reflected interest in particular saints' relics during the 11th century. There was a cult of this earlier (unidentified) St Magnus before the Norman Conquest: several English monastic houses claimed to have relics of the saint; King Edgar gave one to Westminster Abbey; and the relic collection of Peterborough Abbey included the hand of St Magnus the Martyr. The feast of St Magnus the Martyr, celebrated on 19 August, appears in most liturgical calendars from the Gelasian Sacramentary in the eighth century and the missal of Robert of JumiÃ¨ges in the 11th century to the 16th century.\nIt is therefore likely that the original dedication of the church was to St Magnus of Anagni, a putative second-century bishop, martyred in the reign of the Emperor Decius, whose feast was celebrated on 19 August. This identification was proposed by Richard Thomson in his Chronicles of London Bridge of 1827, and has more recently been argued at greater length by Matthew Payne and Michael Cooper. It is possible that the dedication was influenced by Cnut's journey to Rome in 1027 or by the translation to Canterbury in 1023 of the remains of Alphage, Bishop and Martyr, from St Paul's Cathedral, where a cult had rapidly developed at his tomb.\nThe feast on 19 August was still celebrated in the 16th century. It was included in an \"Almanack\" attached to Miles Coverdale's translation of the Bible and in the Preces Privitae of 1564 (authorised by Elizabeth I for private devotion), but was excluded from the Book of Common Prayer. It was also omitted from the Tridentine calendar, falling as it did within the Octave of the Assumption, but has remained in local calendars. St Magnus of Anagni also remains in the Martyrologium Romanum.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 11th and 12th centuries: foundation ===\n\nA metropolitan bishop of London attended the Council of Arles in 314, which indicates that there must have been a Christian community in Londinium by this date, and it has been suggested that a large aisled building excavated in 1993 near Tower Hill can be compared with the 4th-century Cathedral of St Tecla in Milan. However, there is no evidence to suggest that any of the mediaeval churches in the City of London had a Roman foundation.\n\nThe archaeological record suggests that the area of the bridgehead was not occupied from the early 5th century until the early 10th century. Environmental evidence indicates that the area was waste ground during this period, colonised by elder and nettles. Following Alfred the Great's decision to reoccupy the walled area of London in 886, new harbours were established at Queenhithe and Billingsgate. A wooden bridge was in place by the early 11th century, a factor which would have encouraged the occupation of the bridgehead by craftsmen and traders. During the 10th and 11th centuries, as overseas trade revived, the landing places immediately downstream of the bridge became ever more significant. Streets were laid out in the vicinity of the bridge leading from the river into the eastern part of the City. Fish Street Hill, leading from the bridge itself to Bishopsgate, originated earlier.\nThe narrow strip of land south of the Roman river wall widened enough to accommodate a significant number of buildings and a collapse of part of the wall, probably at some point between 1016 and 1066, helped to facilitate access. The waterfront at this time was a hive of activity, with the construction of embankments sloping down from the riverside wall to the river.  A lane connecting Botolph's Wharf and Billingsgate to the rebuilt bridge had developed by the mid-11th century. Thames Street appeared in the second half of the 11th century immediately behind (north of) the old Roman riverside wall and in 1931 a piling from this was discovered during the excavation of the foundations of a nearby building. It now stands at the base of the church tower. St Magnus was built to the south of Thames Street to serve the growing population of the bridgehead area in the 11th century.\nThe small ancient parish extended about 110 yards along the waterfront either side of the old bridge, from 'Stepheneslane' (later Churchehawlane or Church Yard Alley) and 'Oystergate' (later called Water Lane or Gully Hole) on the West side to 'Retheresgate' (a southern extension of Pudding Lane) on the East side, and was centred on the crossroads formed by Fish Street Hill (originally Bridge Street, then New Fish Street) and Thames Street. The mediaeval parish also included Drinkwater's Wharf (named after the owner, Thomas Drinkwater), which was located immediately West of the bridge, and Fish Wharf, which was to the south of the church. The latter was of considerable importance as the fishmongers had their shops on the wharf. The tenement was devised by Andrew Hunte to the Rector and Churchwardens in 1446. The ancient parish was situated in the South East part of Bridge Ward, which had evolved in the first half of the 11th century between the embankments to either side of the bridge.\nSt Magnus was purportedly granted by William I in 1067 to Westminster Abbey. Although this charter is generally accepted to be a later forgery by Osbert of Clare, Prior of Westminster Abbey, as is a charter of confirmation in 1108â16, it may preserve genuine evidence of a foundation of the church in the 11th century. There is a further document referring to the church in 1128â33. In the second half of the 12th century control of the advowson of St Magnus was disputed between the Abbot of Westminster and the Prior of Bermondsey.  The case was resolved in the Curia Regis on 23 April 1182, with the advowson being divided equally between them. Later in the 1180s, on their joint presentation, the Archdeacon of London inducted his nephew as parson. On 14 April 1208, again on the joint presentation of the Abbot of Westminster and the Prior of Bermondsey, the Bishop of London instituted Simon de Valenciis to St Magnus.\n\n\n=== 13th and 14th centuries: stone bridge and chapel of St Thomas Becket ===\n\nBetween the late Saxon period and 1209 there was a series of wooden bridges across the Thames, but in that year a stone bridge was completed. The work was overseen by Peter of Colechurch, a priest and head of the Fraternity of the Brethren of London Bridge. The Church had from early times encouraged the building of bridges and this activity was so important it was perceived to be an act of piety â a commitment to God which should be supported by the giving of alms. London's citizens made gifts of land and money \"to God and the Bridge\". The Bridge House Estates became part of the City's jurisdiction in 1282.\n\nUntil 1831 the bridge was aligned with Fish Street Hill, so the main entrance into the City from the south passed the West door of St Magnus on the north bank of the river. The bridge included a chapel dedicated to St Thomas Becket for the use of pilgrims journeying to Canterbury Cathedral to visit his tomb. The chapel and about two thirds of the bridge were in the parish of St Magnus. After some years of rivalry a dispute arose between the church and the chapel over the offerings given to the chapel by the pilgrims. The matter was resolved by the brethren of the chapel making an annual contribution to St Magnus. At the Reformation the chapel was turned into a house and later a warehouse, the latter being demolished in 1757â58.\nThe church grew in importance. On 21 November 1234 a grant of land was made to the parson of St Magnus for the enlargement of the church. The London Eyre of 1244 recorded that in 1238 \"A thief named William of Ewelme of the county of Buckingham fled to the church of St. Magnus the Martyr, London, and there acknowledged the theft and abjured the realm. He had no chattels.\" Another entry recorded that \"The City answers saying that the church of ... St. Magnus the Martyr ... which [is] situated on the king's highway ... ought to belong to the king and be in his gift\". The church presumably jutted into the road running to the bridge, as it did in later times. In 1276 it was recorded that \"the church of St. Magnus the Martyr is worth Â£15 yearly and Master Geoffrey de la Wade now holds it by the grant of the prior of Bermundeseie and the abbot of Westminster to whom King Henry conferred the advowson by his charter.\"\n\nIn 1274 \"came King Edward and his wife [Eleanor] from the Holy Land and were crowned at Westminster on the Sunday next after the Feast of the Assumption of Our Lady [15 August], being the Feast of Saint Magnus [19 August]; and the Conduit in Chepe ran all the day with red wine and white wine to drink, for all such as wished.\" Edward I's eldest son, Alphonso, Earl of Chester, died at Windsor on the feast of St Magnus, 19 August 1284. Stow records that \"in the year 1293, for victory obtained by Edward I against the Scots, every citizen, according to their several trade, made their several show, but especially the fishmongers\" whose solemn procession including a knight \"representing St Magnus, because it was upon St Magnus' day\".\nAlderman Hugh Pourt, fishmonger and Sheriff of London, and his wife Margaret founded a perpetual chantry at the start of the 14th century. An important religious guild, the Confraternity de Salve Regina, was in existence by 1343, having been founded by the \"better sort of the Parish of St Magnus\" to sing the anthem 'Salve Regina' every evening. The Guild certificates of 1388/89 (12 Richard II) record that the Confraternity of Salve Regina and the guild of St Thomas the Martyr in the chapel on the bridge, whose members belonged to St Magnus parish, had determined to become one, to have the anthem of St Thomas after the Salve Regina and to devote their united resources to restoring and enlarging the church of St Magnus. An act of Parliament of 1437, the Guilds and Fraternities Act 1436 (15 Hen. 6. c. 6), provided that all incorporated fraternities and companies should register their charters and have their ordinances approved by the civic authorities. Fear of enquiry into their privileges may have led established fraternities to seek a firm foundation for their rights. The letters patent of the fraternity of St Mary and St Thomas the Martyr of Salve Regina in St Magnus dated 26 May 1448 mention that the fraternity had petitioned for a charter on the grounds that the society was not duly founded.\n\nIn the mid-14th century the Pope was the Patron of the living and appointed five rectors to the benefice.\nHenry Yevele, the master mason whose work included the rebuilding of Westminster Hall, the naves of Westminster Abbey and Canterbury Cathedral and the tomb of John of Gaunt and his first wife Blanche of Lancaster in old St Paul's, was a parishioner and rebuilt the chapel on London Bridge between 1384 and 1397. He served as a warden of London Bridge and was buried at St Magnus on his death in 1400. His monument was extant in John Stow's time, but was probably destroyed by the fire of 1666.\nYevele, as the King's Mason, was overseen by Geoffrey Chaucer in his capacity as the Clerk of the King's Works.  In The General Prologue of Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales the five guildsmen \"were clothed alle in o lyveree of a solempne and a greet fraternitee\" and may be thought of as belonging to the guild in the parish of St Magnus, or one like it. Chaucer's family home was near to the bridge in Thames Street. St Magnus appears several times in Anya Seton's historical novel Katherine, which is set in the 14th century.\n\n\n=== 15th and 16th centuries: before and after the Reformation ===\nIn 1417 a dispute arose concerning who should take the place of honour amongst the rectors in the City churches at the Whit Monday procession, a place that had been claimed from time to time by the rectors of St Peter Cornhill, St Magnus the Martyr and St Nicholas Cole Abbey. The Mayor and Aldermen decided that the Rector of St Peter Cornhill should take precedence.\nIn 1413 John Hert, grocer, bequeathed Â£40 to the parish to build a new south aisle. Two adjoining plots of land laying to the south of the nave were donated to the church, one by Henry Yevele in 1400, and the other by John Hale, Goldsmith, in 1426. This site was quickly developed into a cloister, used primarily as a graveyard, but undoubtedly with additional symbolic and processional purposes. For example, Henry Crane, citizen and fletcher, requested burial in the cloister of St Magnus Martyr and left 3s 4d to the parish clerks' brotherhood to pray for his soul in his will of 18 July, proved 4 August 1486.\n\nSt Magnus Corner at the north end of London Bridge was an important meeting place in mediaeval London, where notices were exhibited, proclamations read out and wrongdoers punished. As it was conveniently close to the River Thames, the church was chosen by the Bishop between the 15th and 17th centuries as a convenient venue for general meetings of the clergy in his diocese.\nSt Magnus maintained a group of singing children from the 1470s until the 1550s.\nIn pictures from the mid-16th century the old church looks very similar to the present-day St Giles without Cripplegate in the Barbican. The London and Middlesex Chantry Certificate of 1548 listed the value of chantries attached to the church and the Fraternity of Salve Regina, the annual income of the latter being Â£49 16s 8d.  The wardens said that church lands had been used for the past 200 years to maintain the church.  A sum of Â£9 p.a. was paid to Robert Saye, priest.  By the 1550s Saye was a Vicar Choral at St Paul's Cathedral and he probably moved from St Magnus when the chantry there was closed.\nDr John Young, Bishop of Callipolis (rector of St Magnus 1514â15) pronounced judgement on 16 December 1514 (with the Bishop of London and in the presence of Thomas More, then under-sheriff of London) in the heresy case concerning Richard Hunne. In the summer of 1527, Thomas Bilney preached a sermon at St Magnus criticising its newly-erected rood, awaiting gilding, as idolatrous. He was tried for heresy in December 1527 but recanted and was released.  However, there was a co-ordinated campaign to discredit him, and he was tried again in 1531 after a relapse into heresy and was burned at the stake in Norwich on 19 August (St Magnus Day) 1531.  A plaque erected in 1931 to mark the 400th anniversary of his death calls him the \"spiritual father of the Reformation in England\".\nMaurice Griffith was rector here from 1537 until his death in 1558, holding the Bishopric of Rochester as well from 1554. His funeral, held at St Magnus, was a splendid affair, with chief mourners Sir William Petre, Sir William Garrard and Simon Lowe. These last two were parishioners. Sir William Garrard, Master of the Haberdashers' Company, Alderman, Sheriff of London in 1553/53, Lord Mayor in 1555/56 and a Member of Parliament was born in the parish and buried at St Magnus in 1571.Simon Lowe was a Member of Parliament and Master of the Merchant Taylors' Company during the reign of Queen Mary and one of the jurors who acquitted Sir Nicholas Throckmorton in 1554.\nThe patronage of St Magnus, having previously been in the Abbots and Convents of Westminster and Bermondsey (who presented alternately), fell to the Crown on the suppression of the monasteries. In 1553, Queen Mary, by letters patent, granted it to the Bishop of London and his successors. According to the martyrologist John Foxe, a woman was imprisoned in the 'cage' on London Bridge in April 1555 and told to \"cool herself there\" for refusing to pray at St Magnus for the recently deceased Pope Julius III.\n\nJohn Rylie, citizen and haberdasher, bequeathed his dwelling house at the north end of London Bridge to charity in 1577. Sir William Romney, merchant, philanthropist, Master of the Haberdashers' Company, Alderman for Bridge Within and Sheriff of London in 1603/04 was married at St Magnus in 1582. Ben Jonson is believed to have been married at St Magnus in 1594.\nThe church had a series of distinguished rectors in the second half of the 16th and first half of the 17th century, including Myles Coverdale (Rector 1564â66), John Young (Rector 1566â92), Theophilus Aylmer (Rector 1592â1625), (Archdeacon of London and son of John Aylmer), and Cornelius Burges (Rector 1626â41). Coverdale was buried in the chancel of St Bartholomew-by-the-Exchange, but when that church was pulled down in 1840 his remains were removed to St Magnus.\nSt Magnus's rood, along with \"several other things of superstition belonging to that church\", were destroyed on 16 September 1559 in \"an ebullition of Protestant zeal\" On 5 November 1562 the churchwardens were ordered to break, or cause to be broken, in two parts all the altar stones in the church. Coverdale, an anti-vestiarian, was Rector at the peak of the vestments controversy. In March 1566 Archbishop Parker caused great consternation among many clergy by his edicts prescribing what was to be worn and by his summoning the London clergy to Lambeth to require their compliance. Coverdale excused himself from attending. Stow records that a non-conforming Scot who normally preached at St Magnus twice a day precipitated a fight on Palm Sunday 1566 at Little All Hallows in Thames Street with his preaching against vestments. Coverdale's resignation from St Magnus in summer 1566 may have been associated with these events. Separatist congregations started to emerge after 1566 and the first such, who called themselves 'Puritans' or 'Unspottyd Lambs of the Lord', was discovered close to St Magnus at Plumbers' Hall in Thames Street on 19 June 1567.\n\n\n=== 17th century: Civil War, Commonwealth and Restoration ===\n\nSt Magnus narrowly escaped destruction in 1633. A later edition of Stow's Survey records that \"On the 13th day of February, between eleven and twelve at night, there happened in the house of one Briggs, a Needle-maker near St Magnus Church, at the North end of the Bridge, by the carelessness of a Maid-Servant setting a tub of hot sea-coal ashes under a pair of stairs, a sad and lamentable fire, which consumed all the buildings before eight of the clock the next morning, from the North end of the Bridge to the first vacancy on both sides, containing forty-two houses; water then being very scarce, the Thames being almost frozen over.\"  Susannah Chambers \"by her last will & testament bearing date 28th December 1640 gave the sum of Twenty-two shillings and Sixpence Yearly for a Sermon to be preached on the 12th day of February in every Year within the Church of Saint Magnus in commemoration of God's merciful preservation of the said Church of Saint Magnus from Ruin, by the late and terrible Fire on London Bridge. Likewise Annually to the Poor the sum of 17/6.\"  The tradition of a \"Fire Sermon\" was revived on 12 February 2004, when the first preacher was the Rt Revd and Rt Hon Richard Chartres, Bishop of London.\n\nParliamentarian rule and the more Protestant ethos of the 1640s led to the removal or destruction of \"superstitious\" and \"idolatrous\" images and fittings. Glass painters such as Baptista Sutton, who had previously installed \"Laudian innovations\", found new employment by repairing and replacing these to meet increasingly strict Protestant standards. In January 1642 Sutton replaced 93 feet of glass at St Magnus and in June 1644 he was called back to take down the \"painted imagery glass\" and replace it. In June 1641 \"rail riots\" broke out at a number of churches. This was a time of high tension following the trial and execution of the Earl of Strafford and rumours of army and popish plots were rife. The Protestation Oath, with its pledge to defend the true religion \"against all Popery and popish innovation\", triggered demands from parishioners for the removal of the rails as popish innovations which the Protestation had bound them to reform. The minister arranged a meeting between those for and against the pulling down of the rails, but was unsuccessful in reaching a compromise and it was feared that they would be demolished by force. However, in 1663 the parish resumed Laudian practice and re-erected rails around its communion table.\nJoseph Caryl was incumbent from 1645 until his ejection in 1662. In 1663 he was reportedly living near London Bridge and preaching to an Independent congregation that met at various places in the City.\nDuring the Great Plague of 1665, the City authorities ordered fires to be kept burning night and day, in the hope that the air would be cleansed. Daniel Defoe's semi-fictional, but highly realistic, work A Journal of the Plague Year records that one of these was \"just by St Magnus Church\".\n\n\n=== Great Fire of London and rebuilding of the church ===\n\nDespite its escape in 1633, the church was one of the first buildings to be destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. St Magnus stood less than 300 yards from the bakehouse of Thomas Farriner in Pudding Lane where the fire started. Farriner, a former churchwarden of St Magnus, was buried in the middle aisle of the church on 11 December 1670, perhaps within a temporary structure erected for holding services.\nThe parish engaged the master mason George Dowdeswell to start the work of rebuilding in 1668.  The work was carried forward between 1671 and 1687 under the direction of Sir Christopher Wren, the body of the church being substantially complete by 1676. At a cost of Â£9,579 19s 10d St Magnus was one of Wren's most expensive churches. The church of St Margaret New Fish Street was not rebuilt after the fire and its parish was united to that of St Magnus.\n\nThe chancels of many of Wren's city churches had chequered marble floors and the chancel of St Magnus is an example, the parish agreeing after some debate to place the communion table on a marble ascent with steps and to commission altar rails of Sussex wrought iron. The nave and aisles are paved with freestone flags. A lantern and cupola, closely modelled on the steeple built between 1614 and 1624 by FranÃ§ois d'Aguilon and Pieter Huyssens for the church of St Carolus Borromeus in Antwerp, was added between 1703 and 1706. London's skyline was transformed by Wren's tall steeples and that of St Magnus is considered to be one of his finest.\nThe large clock projecting from the tower was a well-known landmark in the city as it hung over the roadway of Old London Bridge. It was presented to the church in 1709 by Sir Charles Duncombe (Alderman for the Ward of Bridge Within and, in 1708/09, Lord Mayor of London). Tradition says \"that it was erected in consequence of a vow made by the donor, who, in the earlier part of his life, had once to wait a considerable time in a cart upon London Bridge, without being able to learn the hour, when he made a promise, that if he ever became successful in the world, he would give to that Church a public clock ... that all passengers might see the time of day.\" The maker was Langley Bradley, a clockmaker in Fenchurch Street, who had worked for Wren on many other projects, including the clock for the new St Paul's Cathedral. The sword rest in the church, designed to hold the Lord Mayor's sword and mace when he attended divine service \"in state\", dates from 1708.\nDuncombe and his benefactions to St Magnus feature prominently in Daniel Defoe's The True-Born Englishman, a biting satire on critics of William III that went through several editions from 1700 (the year in which Duncombe was elected Sheriff).\n\nShortly before his death in 1711, Duncombe commissioned an organ for the church, the first to have a swell-box, by Abraham Jordan (father and son). The Spectator announced that \"Whereas Mr Abraham Jordan, senior and junior, have, with their own hands, joinery excepted, made and erected a very large organ in St Magnus' Church, at the foot of London Bridge, consisting of four sets of keys, one of which is adapted to the art of emitting sounds by swelling notes, which never was in any organ before; this instrument will be publicly opened on Sunday next [14 February 1712], the performance by Mr John Robinson. The above-said Abraham Jordan gives notice to all masters and performers, that he will attend every day next week at the said Church, to accommodate all those gentlemen who shall have a curiosity to hear it\".\nThe organ case, which remains in its original state, is looked upon as one of the finest existing examples of the Grinling Gibbons's school of wood carving. The first organist of St Magnus was John Robinson (1682â1762), who served in that role for fifty years (1712â62) and in addition as organist of Westminster Abbey from 1727. Other organists have included Henry Heron (1738â95, organist 1762-95), the blind organist George Warne (1792â1868, organist 1820â26 until his appointment to the Temple Church), James Coward (1824â80, organist 1868â80 who was also organist to the Crystal Palace and renowned for his powers of improvisation) and George Frederick Smith FRCO (1856â1918, organist 1880â1918 and Professor of Music at the Guildhall School of Music). The organ has been restored several times since it was first built: in 1760 by John Sedgewick, 1782 by Thomas Parker and John Frost, 1804 by George Parsons, 1855 by Gray & Davison, 1861 by T Hill & Son, 1879 by Messrs Brindley & Foster, 1891 by Hill & Son, 1924 and, after wartime damage, 1949 by R. Spurden Rutt & Co, and 1997 by Hill, Norman & Beard Sir Peter Maxwell Davies was one of several patrons of the organ appeal in the mid-1990s and John Scott gave an inaugural recital on 20 May 1998 following the completion of that restoration. The instrument has an Historic Organ Certificate and full details are recorded in the National Pipe Organ Register.\nThe hymn tune \"St Magnus\", usually sung at Ascensiontide to the text \"The head that once was crowned with thorns\", was written by Jeremiah Clarke in 1701 and named for the church.\n\n\n=== Last years of old London Bridge ===\n\nCanaletto drew St Magnus and old London Bridge as they appeared in the late 1740s. Between 1756 and 1762, under the London Bridge Improvement Act of 1756 (c. 40), the Corporation of London demolished the buildings on London Bridge to widen the roadway, ease traffic congestion and improve safety for pedestrians. The churchwardens' accounts of St Magnus list many payments to those injured on the Bridge and record that in 1752 a man was crushed to death between two carts. In the summer of 1724 the churchwardens had been obliged to spend 1/6 on \"Expenses with the churchwardens of Woodford about taking away their pentioner Jane Taverner killed [by a cart] on the Bridge\"\nAfter the House of Commons had resolved upon the alteration of London Bridge, the Rev Robert Gibson (Rector 1747-91) applied to the House for relief; stating that 48l. 6s. 2d. per annum, part of his salary of 170l. per annum, was assessed upon houses on London Bridge; which he should utterly lose by their removal unless a clause in the bill about to be passed should provide a remedy. Accordingly, Sections 18 and 19 of 1756 Act provided that the relevant amounts of tithe and poor rate should be a charge on the Bridge House Estates.\nA serious fire broke out on 18 April 1760 in an oil shop at the south-east corner of the church, which consumed most of the church roof and did considerable damage to the fabric. The fire burnt warehouses to the south of the church and a number of houses on the northern end of London Bridge.\n\nAs part of the bridge improvements, overseen by the architect Sir Robert Taylor, a new pedestrian walkway was built along the eastern side of the bridge. With the other buildings gone St Magnus blocked the new walkway. As a consequence it was necessary in 1762 to 1763 to remove the vestry rooms at the West end of the church and open up the side arches of the tower so that people could pass underneath the tower. The tower's lower storey thus became an external porch and two windows were lost from the north facade. Internally a lobby was created at the West end under the organ gallery and a screen with fine octagonal glazing inserted. A new Vestry was built to the south of the church. The Act also provided that the land taken from the church for the widening was \"to be considered ... as part of the cemetery of the said church ... but if the pavement thereof be broken up on account of the burying of any persons, the same shall be ... made good ... by the churchwardens\".\n\nSoldiers were stationed in the Vestry House of St Magnus during the Gordon Riots in June 1780.\nBy 1782 the noise level from the activities of Billingsgate Fish Market had become unbearable and the large windows on the north side of the church were blocked up leaving only circular windows high up in the wall. The parapet and pediment above the north aisle door were probably removed at the same time. At some point between the 1760s and 1814 the present clerestory was constructed with its oval windows and fluted and coffered plasterwork. J. M. W. Turner painted the church in the mid-1790s.\nThe rector of St Magnus between 1792 and 1808, following the death of Robert Gibson on 28 July 1791, was Thomas Rennell FRS. Rennell was President of Sion College in 1806/07. There is a monument to Thomas Leigh (Rector 1808â48 and President of Sion College 1829/30), at St Peter's Church, Goldhanger in Essex. Richard Hazard (1761â1837) was connected with the church as sexton, parish clerk and ward beadle for nearly 50 years and served as Master of the Parish Clerks' Company in 1831/32.\nIn 1825 the church was \"repaired and beautified at a very considerable expense. During the reparation the east window, which had been closed, was restored, and the interior of the fabric conformed to the state in which it was left by its great architect, Sir Christopher Wren. The magnificent organ ... was taken down and rebuilt by Mr Parsons, and re-opened, with the church, on the 12th February, 1826\". Unfortunately, as a contemporary writer records, \"On the night of the 31st of July, 1827, [the church's] safety was threatened by the great fire which consumed the adjacent warehouses, and it is perhaps owing to the strenuous and praiseworthy exertions of the firemen, that the structure exists at present. ... divine service was suspended and not resumed until the 20th January 1828. In the interval the church received such tasteful and elegant decorations, that it may now compete with any church in the metropolis.\"\n\n\n=== New London Bridge: a changing environment ===\n\nIn 1823 royal assent was given to 'An Act for the Rebuilding of London Bridge' and in 1825 John Garratt, Lord Mayor and Alderman of the Ward of Bridge Within, laid the first stone of the new London Bridge. In 1831 Sir John Rennie's new bridge was opened further upstream and the old bridge demolished. St Magnus ceased to be the gateway to London as it had been for over 600 years. Peter de Colechurch had been buried in the crypt of the chapel on the bridge and his bones were unceremoniously dumped in the River Thames. In 1921 two stones from Old London Bridge were discovered across the road from the church. They now stand in the churchyard.\nWren's church of St Michael Crooked Lane was demolished, the final service on Sunday 20 March 1831 having to be abandoned due to the effects of the building work. The Rector of St Michael preached a sermon the following Sunday at St Magnus lamenting the demolition of his church with its monuments and \"the disturbance of the worship of his parishioners on the preceding Sabbath\". The parish of St Michael Crooked Lane was united to that of St Magnus, which itself lost a burial ground in Church Yard Alley to the approach road for the new bridge. However, in substitution it had restored to it the land taken for the widening of the old bridge in 1762 and was also given part of the approach lands to the east of the old bridge. In 1838 the Committee for the London Bridge Approaches reported to Common Council that new burial grounds had been provided for the parishes of St Michael, Crooked Lane and St Magnus, London Bridge.\n\nDepictions of St Magnus after the building of the new bridge, seen behind Fresh Wharf and the new London Bridge Wharf, include paintings by W. Fenoulhet in 1841 and by Charles Ginner in 1913. This prospect was affected in 1924 by the building of Adelaide House to a design by John James Burnet, The Times commenting that \"the new 'architectural Matterhorn' ... conceals all but the tip of the church spire\". There was, however, an excellent view of the church for a few years between the demolition of Adelaide Buildings and the erection of its replacement. Adelaide House is now listed. Regis House, on the site of the abandoned King William Street terminus of the City & South London Railway (subsequently the Northern Line), and the Steam Packet Inn, on the corner of Lower Thames Street and Fish Street Hill, were developed in 1931.\n\nBy the early 1960s traffic congestion had become a problem and Lower Thames Street was widened over the next decade to form part of a significant new eastâwest transport artery (the A3211). The setting of the church was further affected by the construction of a new London Bridge between 1967 and 1973. The New Fresh Wharf warehouse to the east of the church, built in 1939, was demolished in 1973-4 following the collapse of commercial traffic in the Pool of London and, after an archaeological excavation, St Magnus House was constructed on the site in 1978 to a design by R. Seifert & Partners. This development now allows a clear view of the church from the east side. The site to the south-east of The Monument (between Fish Street Hill and Pudding Lane), formerly predominantly occupied by fish merchants, was redeveloped as Centurion House and Gartmore (now Providian) House at the time of the closure of old Billingsgate Market in January 1982. A comprehensive redevelopment of Centurion House (renamed Monument Place) began in October 2011 and the building was let in 2014. Regis House, to the south-west of The Monument, was redeveloped by Land Securities PLC in 1998.\nThe vista from The Monument south to the River Thames, over the roof of St Magnus, is protected under the City of London Unitary Development Plan, although the South bank of the river is now dominated by The Shard. Since 2004 the City of London Corporation has been exploring ways of enhancing the Riverside Walk to the south of St Magnus. Work on a new staircase to connect London Bridge to the Riverside Walk is due to commence in March 2013. The story of St Magnus's relationship with London Bridge and an interview with the rector featured in the television programme The Bridges That Built London with Dan Cruickshank, first broadcast on BBC Four on 14 June 2012. The City Corporation's 'Fenchurch and Monument Area Enhancement Strategy' of August 2012 recommended ways of reconnecting St Magnus and the riverside to the area north of Lower Thames Street.\n\n\n=== Late 19th century and early 20th century ===\nA lectureship at St Michael, Crooked Lane, which was transferred to St Magnus in 1831, was endowed by the wills of Thomas and Susannah Townsend in 1789 and 1812 respectively. The Revd Henry Robert Huckin, Headmaster of Repton School from 1874 to 1882, was appointed Townsend Lecturer at St Magnus in 1871.\nSt Magnus narrowly escaped damage from a major fire in Lower Thames Street in October 1849.\n\nDuring the second half of the 19th century the rectors were Alexander McCaul (1799â1863, Rector 1850â63), who coined the term \"Judaeo Christian\" in a letter dated 17 October 1821, and his son Alexander Israel McCaul (1835â1899, curate 1859â63, rector 1863â99). Another son, Joseph Benjamin McCaul (1827â92) served as curate from 1851 to 1854.  The Revd Alexander McCaul Sr was a Christian missionary to the Polish Jews, who (having declined an offer to become the first Anglican bishop in Jerusalem) was appointed professor of Hebrew and rabbinical literature at King's College London in 1841.  His daughter, Elizabeth Finn (1825â1921), a noted linguist, was the wife of James Finn, the British Consul in Jerusalem from 1846 to 1863.  She founded a number of organizations including the Jerusalem Literary Society, which was the forerunner to the Palestine Exploration Fund, the Society for the Relief of Persecuted Jews (Syrian Colonization Fund) and the Distressed Gentlefolk Aid Association (now known as Elizabeth Finn Care). Both McCaul and his daughter worked closely with Lord Shaftesbury.\nIn 1890 it was reported that the Bishop of London was to hold an inquiry as to the desirability of uniting the benefices of St George Botolph Lane and St Magnus. The expectation was a fusion of the two livings, the demolition of St George's and the pensioning of \"William Gladstone's favourite Canon\", Malcolm MacColl. Although services ceased there, St George's was not demolished until 1904. The parish was then merged with St Mary at Hill rather than St Magnus.\nThe patronage of the living was acquired in the late 19th century by Sir Henry Peek, Senior Partner of Peek Brothers & Co of 20 Eastcheap, the country's largest firm of wholesale tea brokers and dealers, and Chairman of the Commercial Union Assurance Co. Peek was a generous philanthropist who was instrumental in saving both Wimbledon Common and Burnham Beeches from development. His grandson, Sir Wilfred Peek, presented a cousin, Richard Peek, as rector in 1904. Peek, an ardent Freemason, held the office of Grand Chaplain of England.  The Times recorded that his memorial service in July 1920 \"was of a semi-Masonic character, Mr Peek having been a prominent Freemason\". In June 1895 Peek had saved the life of a young French girl who jumped overboard from a ferry midway between Dinard and St Malo in Brittany and was awarded the bronze medal of the Royal Humane Society and the Gold Medal 1st Class of the SociÃ¢etÃ¢e Nationale de Sauvetage de France.\nIn November 1898 a memorial service was held at St Magnus for Sir Stuart Knill (1824â1898), head of the firm of John Knill and Co, wharfingers, and formerly Lord Mayor and Master of the Plumbers' Company. This was the first such service for a Roman Catholic taken in an Anglican church. Sir Stuart's son, Sir John Knill (1856â1934), also served as Alderman for the Ward of Bridge Within, Lord Mayor and Master of the Plumbers' Company.\n\nUntil 1922 the annual Fish Harvest Festival was celebrated at St Magnus. The service moved in 1923 to St Dunstan in the East and then to St Mary at Hill, but St Magnus retained close links with the local fish merchants until the closure of old Billingsgate Market. St Magnus, in the 1950s, was \"buried in the stink of Billingsgate fish-market, against which incense was a welcome antidote\".\n\nA report in 1920 from a committee chaired by Lord Phillimore proposed the demolition of nineteen City churches, including St Magnus. A general outcry from members of the public and parishioners alike prevented the execution of this plan. The members of the City Livery Club passed a resolution that they regarded \"with horror and indignation the proposed demolition of 19 City churches\" and pledged the club to do everything in its power to prevent such a catastrophe. T. S. Eliot wrote that the threatened churches gave \"to the business quarter of London a beauty which its hideous banks and commercial houses have not quite defaced. ... the least precious redeems some vulgar street ... The loss of these towers, to meet the eye down a grimy lane, and of these empty naves, to receive the solitary visitor at noon from the dust and tumult of Lombard Street, will be irreparable and unforgotten.\" The London County Council published a report concluding that St Magnus was \"one of the most beautiful of all Wren's works\" and \"certainly one of the churches which should not be demolished without specially good reasons and after very full consideration.\" Due to the uncertainty about the church's future, the patron decided to defer action to fill the vacancy in the benefice and a curate-in-charge temporarily took responsibility for the parish. However, on 23 April 1921 it was announced that the Revd Henry Joy Fynes-Clinton would be the new rector. The Times concluded that the appointment, with the bishop's approval, meant that the proposed demolition would not be carried out. Fr Fynes-Clinton was inducted on 31 May 1921.\nA further attempt to implement the recommendations of the Phillimore Report in 1926 was resisted by the Earl of Crawford in a debate in the House of Lords on 15 July 1926 who quoted \"to your Lordships the list of these condemned churches. It will not take a moment. Even their fine resounding names are worthy of quotation.... St. Magnus the Martyr â many of your Lordships must know that wonderful church by the water's edge down below London Bridge\".\nThe rectory, built by Robert Smirke in 1833-5, was at 39 King William Street. A decision was taken in 1909 to sell the property, the intention being to purchase a new rectory in the suburbs, but the sale fell through and at the time of the 1910 Land Tax Valuations the building was being let out to a number of tenants. The rectory was sold by the diocese on 30 May 1921 for Â£8,000 to Ridgways Limited, which owned the adjoining premises. The Vestry House adjoining the south-west of the church, replacing the one built in the 1760s, may also have been by Smirke. Part of the burial ground of St Michael, Crooked Lane, located between Fish Street Hill and King William Street, survived as an open space until 1987 when it was compulsorily purchased to facilitate the extension of the Docklands Light Railway into the City. The bodies were reburied at Brookwood Cemetery.\n\n\n=== Between the wars: Fr Fynes and the Anglo-Catholic tradition ===\n\nThe interior of the church was restored by Martin Travers in 1924, in a neo-baroque style, reflecting the Anglo-Catholic character of the congregation following the appointment of Henry Joy Fynes-Clinton as rector. Fynes-Clinton served as rector of St Magnus from 31 May 1921 until his death on 4 December 1959 and substantially beautified the interior of the church.\nFynes-Clinton held very strong Anglo-Catholic views, and proceeded to make St Magnus as much like a baroque Roman Catholic church as possible. However, \"he was such a loveable character with an old-world courtesy which was irresistible, that it was difficult for anyone to be unpleasant to him, however much they might disapprove of his views\". He generally said the Roman Mass in Latin; and in personality was \"grave, grand, well-connected and holy, with a laconic sense of humour\". To a Protestant who had come to see Coverdale's monument he is reported to have said \"We have just had a service in the language out of which he translated the Bible.\" The use of Latin in services was not, however, without grammatical danger. A response from his parishioners of \"Ora pro nobis\" after \"Omnes sancti Angeli et Archangeli\" in the Litany of the Saints would elicit a pause and the correction \"No, Orate pro nobis.\"\n\nIn 1922 Fynes-Clinton refounded the Fraternity of Our Lady de Salve Regina. The fraternity's badge is shown in the stained glass window at the east end of the north wall of the church above the reredos of the Lady Chapel altar. He also erected a statue of Our Lady of Walsingham and arranged pilgrimages to the Norfolk shrine, where he was one of the founding guardians. In 1928 the journal of the Catholic League reported that St Magnus had presented a votive candle to the shrine at Walsingham \"in token of our common Devotion and the mutual sympathy and prayers that are we hope a growing bond between the peaceful country shrine and the church in the heart of the hurrying City, from the Altar of which the Pilgrimages regularly start\".\nFynes-Clinton was General Secretary of the Anglican and Eastern Orthodox Churches Union and its successor, the Anglican and Eastern Churches Association, from 1906 to 1920 and served as Secretary to the Archbishop of Canterbury's Eastern Churches Committee from 1920 to around 1924. A Solemn Requiem was celebrated at St Magnus in September 1921 for the late King Peter of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.\nAt the midday service on 1 March 1922, Ash Wednesday, J. A. Kensit, leader of the Protestant Truth Society, got up and protested against the form of worship. The proposed changes to the church in 1924 led to a hearing in the Consistory Court of the Chancellor of the Diocese of London and an appeal to the Court of Arches. Judgement was given by the latter Court in October 1924. The advowson was purchased in 1931, without the knowledge of the Rector and Parochial Church Council, by the evangelical Sir Charles King-Harman. A number of such cases, including the purchase of the advowsons of Clapham and Hampstead Parish Churches by Sir Charles, led to the passage of the Benefices (Purchase of Rights of Patronage) Measure 1933. This allowed the parishioners of St Magnus to purchase the advowson from Sir Charles King-Harman for Â£1,300 in 1934 and transfer it to the Patronage Board.\n\nSt Magnus was one of the churches that held special services before the opening of the second Anglo-Catholic Congress in 1923. Fynes-Clinton was the first incumbent to hold lunchtime services for City workers. PathÃ© News filmed the Palm Sunday procession at St Magnus in 1935. In The Towers of Trebizond, the novel by Rose Macaulay published in 1956, Fr Chantry-Pigg's church is described as being several feet higher than St Mary's, Bourne Street and some inches above even St Magnus the Martyr.\nIn July 1937 Fr Fynes-Clinton, with two members of his congregation, travelled to Kirkwall to be present at the 800th anniversary celebrations of St Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall. During their stay they visited Egilsay and were shown the spot where St Magnus had been slain. Later Fynes-Clinton was present at a service held at the roofless church of St Magnus on Egilsay, where he suggested to his host Mr Fryer, the minister of the Cathedral, that the congregations of Kirkwall and London should unite to erect a permanent stone memorial on the traditional site where Earl Magnus had been murdered. In 1938 a cairn was built of local stone on Egilsay. It stands 12 feet high and is 6 feet broad at its base. The memorial was dedicated on 7 September 1938 and a bronze inscription on the monument reads \"erected by the Rector and Congregation of St Magnus the Martyr by London Bridge and the Minister and Congregation of St Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall to commemorate the traditional spot where Earl Magnus was slain, AD circa 1116 and to commemorate the Octocentenary of St Magnus Cathedral 1937\".\n\n\n=== World War II to 21st century ===\nA bomb which fell on London Bridge in 1940 during the Blitz of World War II blew out all the windows and damaged the plasterwork and the roof of the north aisle. However, the church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950 and repaired in 1951, being re-opened for worship in June of that year by the Bishop of London, William Wand. The architect was Laurence King.  \"At St Magnus the Martyr almost the whole of the plaster work had to be reproduced.  Fortunately, as in some other cases, the furniture had been safely stored, but against Â£16,000 only Â£9,000 was recoverable.\" Restoration and redecoration work has subsequently been carried out several times, including after a fire in the early hours of 4 November 1995. Cleaning of the exterior stonework was completed in 2010.\n\nSome minor changes were made to the parish boundary in 1954, including the transfer to St Magnus of an area between Fish Street Hill and Pudding Lane. The site of St Leonard Eastcheap, a church that was not rebuilt after the Great Fire, is therefore now in the parish of St Magnus despite being united to St Edmund the King.\nFr Fynes-Clinton marked the 50th anniversary of his priesthood in May 1952 with High Mass at St Magnus and lunch at Fishmongers' Hall. On 20 September 1956 a solemn Mass was sung in St Magnus to commence the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the restoration of the Holy House at Walsingham in 1931. In the evening of that day a reception was held in the large chamber of Caxton Hall, when between three and four hundred guests assembled.\nFr Fynes-Clinton was succeeded as rector in 1960 by Fr Colin Gill, formerly Vicar of St Martin's Brighton, who remained as incumbent until his death in 1983. Fr Gill was also closely connected with Walsingham and served as a Guardian between 1953 and 1983, including nine years as Master of the College of Guardians. He celebrated the Mass at the first National Pilgrimage in 1959 and presided over the Jubilee celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary of the Shrine in 1981, having been present at the Holy House's opening. A number of the congregation of St Stephen's Lewisham moved to St Magnus around 1960, following temporary changes in the form of worship there.\n\nIn 1971 a Commission chaired by Lord Justice Buckley proposed changes to the City churches, including the creation of seven team ministries.  St Magnus would have been part of a Fenchurch team along with All Hallows by the Tower, St Olave's Hart Street and St Margaret Pattens. In 1994 the Templeman Commission proposed a radical restructuring of the churches in the City Deanery. St Magnus was identified as one of the 12 churches that would remain as either a parish or an 'active' church. However, the proposals were dropped following a public outcry and the consecration of a new Bishop of London.  Following the departure of Fr Michael Woodgate (Rector 1984 to 1995) the presentation to the living was suspended until 2010. The Ven Ken Gibbons was Priest-in-Charge from 1997 to 2003.\nThe parish priest since 2003 has been Fr Philip Warner, who was previously priest-in-charge of St Mary's Church, Belgrade (Diocese in Europe) and Apokrisiarios for the Archbishop of Canterbury to the Serbian Orthodox Church. Since January 2004 there has been an annual Blessing of the Thames, with the congregations of St Magnus and Southwark Cathedral meeting in the middle of London Bridge. On Sunday 3 July 2011, in anticipation of the feast of the translation of St Thomas Becket (7 July), a procession from St Magnus brought a relic of the saint to the middle of the bridge. On 25 May 2016, as part of a joint initiative between the Church of England and the Catholic Church of England and Wales, a relic of St Thomas Becket from Esztergom in Hungary was brought to St Magnus for veneration followed by Solemn Pontifical Vespers celebrated by the Revd Jonathan Baker, Bishop of Fulham.  The Bishop of the Diocese of SzegedâCsanÃ¡d, The Rt Revd LÃ¡szlÃ³ Kiss-RigÃ³, gave a short homily on the history of the relic.\nWilliam Petter was Director of Music from 2011 until his death in 2016, having been a founder member of the Choir of St Magnus the Martyr in 2005. His predecessor was Thomas Kennedy, and successor was Lottie Bagnall. William Johnston Davies took over in 2020, before the current Director, Edward Walters, commenced in September 2023. The choir issued CDs in 2013 (Regina Coeli) and 2014 (Inexplicable Splendour).  St Magnus's organist, John Eady, has won composition competitions for new choral works at St Paul's Cathedral (a setting of Veni Sancte Spiritus first performed on 27 May 2012) and at Lincoln Cathedral (a setting of the Matin responsory for Advent first performed on 30 November 2013). Joseph Atkins composed three pieces for the church: Missa Sancti Magni, Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis and The Blessing of the Bells, a litany and antiphon for the consecration of the new bells in 2009.  David Pearson composed two pieces, the Communion anthem A MhÃ nais mo rÃ¹in (O Magnus of my love) and a hymn to St Magnus, Nobilis, humilis, for performance at the church on the feast of St Magnus the Martyr on 16 April 2012.\nIn addition to liturgical music of a high standard, St Magnus has been the venue for a range of musical events.  The Clemens non Papa Consort, founded in 2005, has performed in collaboration with the production team Concert Bites as a resident ensemble. The band Mishaped Pearls performed at the church on 17 December 2011. St Magnus featured in the television programme Jools Holland: London Calling, first broadcast on BBC2 on 9 June 2012. The Platinum Consort made a promotional film at St Magnus for the release of their debut album In the Dark on 2 July 2012.\nThe Friends of the City Churches had their office in the Vestry House of St Magnus until 2013.\n\n\n== Interior ==\n\nMartin Travers restored the 17th century high altar reredos, including the paintings of Moses and Aaron and the Ten Commandments, and reconstructed the upper storey. Above the reredos Travers added a painted and gilded rood. In the centre of the reredos there is a carved gilded pelican (an early Christian symbol of self-sacrifice) and a Baroque-style roundel with a nimbus and dove descending, attended by cherubim. The glazed east window, which can be seen in early photographs of the church, appears to have been filled in at this time.  A new altar with console tables was installed and the communion rails moved outwards to extend the size of the sanctuary. Two old door frames were used to construct side chapels and placed at an angle across the north-east and south-east corners of the church. One, the Lady Chapel, was dedicated to the Rector's parents in 1925 and the other was dedicated to Christ the King. Originally, a baroque aumbry was used for reservation of the Blessed Sacrament, but later a tabernacle was installed on the Lady Chapel altar and the aumbry was used to house a relic of the True Cross.\nThe interior was made to look more European by the removal of the old box pews and the installation of new pews with cut-down ends. Two new columns were inserted in the nave to make the lines regular. The Wren-period pulpit by the joiner William Grey was opened up and provided with a soundboard and crucifix. Travers also designed the statue of St Magnus of Orkney, which stands in the south aisle, and the statue of Our Lady of Walsingham.\nOn the north wall there is a Russian Orthodox icon, painted in 1908. The modern stations of the cross in honey-coloured Japanese oak are the work of Robert Randall and Ashley Sands. One of the windows in the north wall dates from 1671 and came from Plumbers' Hall in Chequer Yard, Bush Lane, which was demolished in 1863 to make way for Cannon Street railway station. A fireplace from the Hall was re-erected in the Vestry House.  The other windows on the north side are by Alfred L. Wilkinson (1899â1983) and date from 1952 to 1960.  These show the arms of the Plumbers', Fishmongers' and Coopers' Companies together with those of William Wand when Bishop of London and Geoffrey Fisher when Archbishop of Canterbury and (as noted above) the badge of the Fraternity of Our Lady de Salve Regina.\nThe stained glass windows in the south wall, which are by Lawrence Lee and date from 1949 to 1955, represent lost churches associated with the parish: St Magnus and his ruined church of Egilsay, St Margaret of Antioch with her lost church in New Fish Street (where the Monument to the Great Fire now stands), St Michael with his lost church of Crooked Lane (demolished to make way for the present King William Street) and St Thomas Becket with his chapel on Old London Bridge.\nThe church possesses a fine model of Old London Bridge. One of the tiny figures on the bridge appears out of place in the mediaeval setting, wearing a policeman's uniform. This is a representation of the model-maker, David T. Aggett, who is a Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Plumbers and was formerly in the police service.\nThe Mischiefs by Fire Act 1708 and the Fires Prevention (Metropolis) Act 1774 placed a requirement on every parish to keep equipment to fight fires.  The church owns two historic fire engines that belonged to the parish of St Michael, Crooked Lane. One of these is on display in the narthex of the church.  The whereabouts of the other, which was misappropriated and sold at auction in 2003, is currently unknown.\nIn 1894 many bodies were disinterred from the crypt and reburied at the St Magnus's plot at Brookwood Cemetery, which remains the church's burial ground.\n\n\n== Bells ==\n\nPrior to the Great Fire of 1666 the old tower had a ring of five bells, a small saints bell and a clock bell. 47 cwt of bell metal was recovered which suggests that the tenor was 13 or 14 cwt. The metal was used to cast three new bells, by William Eldridge of Chertsey in 1672, with a further saints bell cast that year by Hodson. In the absence of a tower, the tenor and saints bell were hung in a free standing timber structure, whilst the others remained unhung.\nA new tower was completed in 1704 and it is likely that these bells were transferred to it.  However, the tenor became cracked in 1713 and it was decided to replace the bells with a new ring of eight. The new bells, with a tenor of 21 cwt, were cast by Richard Phelps of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. Between 1714 and 1718 (the exact date of which is unknown), the ring was increased to ten with the addition of two trebles given by two former ringing Societies, the Eastern Youths and the British Scholars. The first peal was rung on 15 February 1724 of Grandsire Caters by the Society of College Youths.  The second bell had to be recast in 1748 by Robert Catlin, and the tenor was recast in 1831 by Thomas Mears of Whitechapel, just in time to ring for the opening of the new London Bridge. In 1843, the treble was said to be \"worn out\" and so was scrapped, together with the saints bell, while a new treble was cast by Thomas Mears. A new clock bell was erected in the spire in 1846, provided by B R & J Moore, who had earlier purchased it from Thomas Mears. This bell can still be seen in the tower from the street.\nThe 10 bells were removed for safe keeping in 1940 and stored in the churchyard. They were taken to Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1951 whereupon it was discovered that four of them were cracked. After a long period of indecision, fuelled by lack of funds and interest, the bells were finally sold for scrap in 1976. The metal was used to cast many of the Bells of Congress that were then hung in the Old Post Office Tower in Washington, D.C.\nA fund was set up on 19 September 2005, led by Dickon Love, a member of the Ancient Society of College Youths, with a view to installing a new ring of 12 bells in the tower in a new frame.  This was the first of three new rings of bells he has installed in the City of London (the others being at St Dunstan-in-the-West and St James Garlickhythe). The money was raised and the bells were cast during 2008/9 by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. The tenor weighed 26cwt 3qtr 9 lbs (1360 kg) and the new bells were designed to be in the same key as the former ring of ten. They were consecrated by the Bishop of London on 3 March 2009 in the presence of the Lord Mayor and the ringing dedicated on 26 October 2009 by the Archdeacon of London. The bells are named (in order smallest to largest) Michael, Margaret, Thomas of Canterbury, Mary, Cedd, Edward the Confessor, Dunstan, John the Baptist, Erkenwald, Paul, Mellitus and Magnus. The bells project is recorded by an inscription in the vestibule of the church.\n\nThe first peal on the twelve was rung on 29 November 2009 of Cambridge Surprise Maximus. Notable other recent peals include a peal of Stedman Cinques on 16 April 2011 to mark the 400th anniversary of the granting of a Royal Charter to the Plumbers' Company, a peal of Cambridge Surprise Royal on 28 June 2011 when the Fishmongers' Company gave a dinner for Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh at their hall on the occasion of his 90th birthday and a peal of Avon Delight Maximus on 24 July 2011 in solidarity with the people of Norway following the tragic massacre on Utoeya Island and in Oslo. On the latter occasion the flag of the Orkney Islands was flown at half mast.  In 2012 peals were rung during the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant on 3 June and during each of the three Olympic/Paralympic marathons, on 5 and 12 August and 9 September.  Following the announcement on 9 April 2021 of the death of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh the tenor bell was tolled 99 times and the flag of St George was lowered to half mast.\nThe BBC television programme, Still Ringing After All These Years: A Short History of Bells, broadcast on 14 December 2011, included an interview at St Magnus with the Tower Keeper, Dickon Love, who was captain of the band that rang the \"Royal Jubilee Bells\" during the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant on 3 June 2012 to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. Prior to this, he taught John Barrowman to handle a bell at St Magnus for the BBC coverage.\nThe bells are often rung on Sundays around 12:15 (following the service) by the Guild of St Magnus.\n\n\n== Livery companies and Bridge Ward ==\n\nSt Magnus has connections with three livery companies, whose respective coats of arms are displayed in stained glass windows in the north aisle.  Every other June, newly-elected wardens of the Fishmongers' Company, accompanied by the Court, proceed on foot from Fishmongers' Hall to St Magnus for an election service. St Magnus is also the Guild Church of The Plumbers' Company. Two former rectors have served as Master of the company, which holds all its services at the church. On 12 April 2011 a service was held to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the granting of the company's Royal Charter at which the Bishop of London, the Rt Revd and Rt Hon Richard Chartres KCVO, gave the sermon and blessed the original Royal Charter. The Coopers' Company hold an annual service at which the will of Henry Cloker dated 10 March 1573 is read. Cloker left property in the parish of St Michael Crooked Lane to the Company in trust for the benefit of what is now the Coopers' Company and Coborn School.\nSt Magnus is also the ward church for the Ward of Bridge and Bridge Without, which elects one of the city's aldermen. Between 1550 and 1978 there were separate aldermen for Bridge Within and Bridge Without, the former ward being north of the river and the latter representing the City's area of control in Southwark. The Bridge Ward Club was founded in 1930 to \"promote social activities and discussion of topics of local and general interest and also to exchange ward and parochial information\" and holds its annual carol service at St Magnus.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of churches and cathedrals of London\nList of Christopher Wren churches in London\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nVirtual tour of St-Magnus-the-Martyr\nLove's Guide to the Church Bells of St Magnus the Martyr Archived 29 May 2008 at the Wayback Machine\nA Church Near You\nFriends of the City Churches"

    "wikipediaText": "The Mansion House is the official residence of the Lord Mayor of London. It is a Grade I listed building.  Designed by George Dance in the Palladian style, it was built primarily in the 1740s.\nThe Mansion House is used for some of the City of London's most formal official functions, including two annual white tie dinners. At the Easter banquet, the main speaker is the Foreign Secretary, who then receives a reply from the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps, i.e. the longest-serving ambassador. In early June, it is the turn of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to give his or her \"Mansion House Speech\" about the state of the British economy. The most famous was the Mansion House Speech of 1911 by David Lloyd George, which warned the German Empire against opposing British influence during the period leading up to the First World War.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Mansion House was built between 1739 and 1752, in the Palladian style, by the surveyor and architect George Dance the Elder. The Master Mason was John Deval.\nThe site, at the east end of Poultry, London, had  previously been occupied by the Stocks Market, which by the time of its closure was mostly used for the sale of herbs. The construction was prompted by a wish to put an end to the inconvenient practice of lodging the Lord Mayor in one of the City livery company halls. Dance won a competition over designs solicited from James Gibbs and Giacomo Leoni, and uninvited submissions by Batty Langley and Isaac Ware. Construction was slowed down by the discovery of springs on the site, which meant piles had to be sunk to lay adequate foundations.\nThe original building had two clerestory roof extensions, nicknamed the \"Mayor's Nest\" (a pun on \"mare's nest\") and \"Noah's Ark\".  In 1795 George Dance the Younger re-roofed the central courtyard, and had the \"Noah's Ark\" demolished.  In the same year, the original grand staircase was removed to make way for a further two rooms. In 1835 the entrance steps were reduced to one flight, and in 1842 the \"Mayor's Nest\" was demolished after the ballroom was reconstructed.  The Lord Mayor's private entrance in Walbrook was created in 1845, and in 1849 the former Swordbearer's Room was converted into the Justice Room, effectively the magistrates' court of the City, until 1999 when the court removed to a building on the opposite side of Walbrook.\nFrom 1873, with the Lord Mayor as its president, committee meetings of the Metropolitan Hospital Sunday Fund met at the Mansion House.\n\n\n== Funding ==\nThe Mansion House was paid for in an unusual way: the City authorities, all Church of England men, found a way to tax those of other Christian denominations, particularly the Rational Dissenters. A Unitarian named Samuel Sharpe, banker by day and amateur Egyptologist by night, wrote about it in the 1830s, striking a blow against the Test and Corporate Acts. The article was republished in 1872. Sharpe argues that the Mansion House \"remains as a monument of the unjust manner in which Dissenters were treated in the last century\" (i.e. the 18th, in contrast to his own 19th, century). William Edward Hartpole Lecky in his History of England during the Eighteenth Century (1878) describes the funding of the construction of the Mansion House as \"a very scandalous form of persecution\".\nThere are over one hundred livery companies, the senior members of which form a special electorate known as Common Hall. In 1748 the City of London Corporation devised a Catch-22 situation to raise money, passing a by-law levying a heavy fine on any man who refused to stand for election, or who, once elected to office, refused to serve.  In order to serve as a Sheriff of the City of London, the individual had to have \"taken the sacrament according to the Anglican rite\" within the past year. This was exactly what English Dissenters could not, in conscience, do:\n\n\"It would appear almost incredible, if the facts were not widely attested, that under these circumstances the City of London systematically elected wealthy Dissenters to the office in order that they should be objected to and fined, and that in this manner it extorted no less than Â£15,000. The electors appointed these Dissenters with a clear knowledge that they would not serve, and with the sole purpose of extorting money. One of those whom they selected was blind; another was bedridden.\" Some tried to appeal, but the process was immensely risky and costly, with the City holding all the cards. Eventually a man named Evans began a challenge which lasted ten years; in 1767, the House of Lords, drawing on the Toleration Act 1688, agreed with Lord Mansfield and ruled to curtail the City's abuse of power. In order to avoid civil disabilities such as this financially ruinous persecution, some Dissenters were known to take Communion in their parish church once a year; in the phraseology of the time, \"occasional conformity\" (see Occasional Conformity Act 1711). Thomas Abney rose to be Lord Mayor in this fashion.\nThe American author Mark Twain recounts the story in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1889):\n\nIt reminded me of something I had read in my youth about the ingenious way in which the aldermen of London raised the money that built the Mansion House. A person who had not taken the Sacrament according to the Anglican rite could not stand as a candidate for sheriff of London. Thus Dissenters were ineligible; they could not run if asked, they could not serve if elected. The aldermen, who without any question were Yankees in disguise, hit upon this neat device: they passed a by-law imposing a fine of Â£400 upon any one who should refuse to be a candidate for sheriff, and a fine of Â£600 upon any person who, after being elected sheriff, refused to serve. Then they went to work and elected a lot of Dissenters, one after another, and kept it up until they had collected Â£15,000 in fines; and there stands the stately Mansion House to this day, to keep the blushing citizen in mind of a long past and lamented day when a band of Yankees slipped into London and played games of the sort that has given their race a unique and shady reputation among all truly good and holy peoples that be in the earth.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe Mansion House has three main storeys  over a rusticated basement. The entrance facade has a portico with six Corinthian columns, supporting a pediment with a tympanum sculpture by Sir Robert Taylor, in the centre of which is a symbolic figure of the City of London trampling on her enemies. The building originally had two prominent and unusual attic structures at either end, which were removed in 1794 and 1843. The building is on a confined site. Sir John Summerson wrote that \"it leaves an impression of uneasily constricted bulk\",  adding  that \"on the whole, the building is a striking reminder that good taste was not a universal attribute in the eighteenth century\". The main reception room, the columned  \"Egyptian Hall\", was so named because  Dance used an arrangement of  columns  deemed to be \"Egyptian\" by Vitruvius. No Egyptian motifs were employed.  It has twenty niches for sculpture. There was originally an open courtyard, later occupied by a saloon.\nThe residence used to have its own court of law, since the Lord Mayor is the chief magistrate of the City while in office. There were eleven holding cells (ten for men and one, nicknamed \"the birdcage\", for women). A famous prisoner here was the early 20th-century suffragette women's rights campaigner Sylvia Pankhurst.\n\n\n== Art collection ==\nThe Mansion House is home to the Harold Samuel Collection of Dutch and Flemish Seventeenth Century Paintings, described as \"the finest collection of such works to be formed in Britain this century\". It consists of 84 paintings and includes some outstanding works by artists including Hendrick Avercamp, Gerard Ter Borch, Pieter Claesz, Aelbert Cuyp, Frans Hals, Pieter de Hooch, Jacob van Ruisdael, Jan Steen, David Teniers the Younger and Willem van de Velde. The Mansion House also houses a plate collection, which includes among other treasures, the five ceremonial City of London swords.\n\n\n== Public access ==\nThe Mansion House is not generally open to the public. However, tours can be arranged through the diary office, and there are public tours most Tuesdays.\n\n\n== Mansion House Street ==\nMansion House Street is the short street at the front of the Mansion House, which connects Poultry, Queen Victoria Street and Bank Junction above Bank Underground station.\n\n\n== Other ==\nGuildhall is another venue used for important City functions.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nSutton, Peter C.

    "wikipediaText": "All Hallows Staining was a Church of England church located at the junction of Mark Lane and Dunster Court in the north-eastern corner of Langbourn ward in the City of London, England, close to Fenchurch Street railway station. All that remains of the church is the tower, built around AD 1320 as part of the second church on the site. Use of the grounds around the church is the subject of the Allhallows Staining Church Act 2010 (c. v).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first mention of the church was in the late 12th century.  It was named \"Staining\", which means stone,  to distinguish it from the other churches of All Hallows in the City of London, which were wooden.\nThe old church survived the Great Fire of London in 1666 but collapsed five years later in 1671.  It was thought its foundations had been weakened by too many burials in the churchyard close to the church walls.  The church was rebuilt in 1674.\n\nThe parishes of All Hallows Staining and nearby St Olave Hart Street were combined in 1870.  At that time All Hallows Staining was demolished, leaving only the tower. The proceeds from the demolition funded the construction of a new church in East End of London, All Hallows, Bow.\nDuring the Second World War in 1941, St Olave Hart Street was badly damaged by bombs. Between 1948 and 1954, when the restored St Olave's was reopened, a prefabricated church stood on the site of All Hallows Staining.  This was known as St Olave Mark Lane.  The tower of All Hallows Staining was used as the chancel of the temporary church.\nThe tower is maintained by the Worshipful Company of Clothworkers, one of the livery companies of the City of London. In 1957 the Clothworkers' Company built a church hall for St Olave Hart Street on the site of All Hallows Staining. The old tower now stands at the back of a small courtyard next to the new hall; and the remains of the church were designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.\nThe remains of 'Lambe's Chapel Crypt', lies under the adjacent yard. It was moved from the site of Lambe's Chapel in Monkswell Street and rebuilt here in the midâ12th century. It was said to have formed part of the 'Hermitage of St James on the Wall'. These remains were designated Grade II at the same time as the main tower. William Lambe became a master of the Clothworkers.\n\n\n=== Contemporary description ===\n\nAt the North Corner of this Street, on the same side, was sometime an Hermitage or Chappel of St. James, called In the Wall, near Cripplegate. It belonged to the Abbey and Covent of Garadon, as appeareth by a Record, the Seven and twentieth of Edward I. And also by a Record the 16 of Edward III. William de Lions was Hermit there; and the Abbot and Covent of Geredon found two Chaplains, Cestercian Monks of their House, in this Hermitage: one of them for Aymor de Valence, Earl of Pembrook; and Mary de Saint Paul, his Countess.Of these Monks, and of a Well pertaining to them, the Street took that Name, and is called Monks Well street. This Hermitage, with the Appurtenances, was in the Reign of Edward VI. purchased from the said King, by William Lambe, one of the Gentlemen of the King's Chappel, Citizen and Clothworker of London. He deceased in the Year 1577. and then gave it to the Clothworkers of London; with other Tenements, to the value of Fifty Pounds the Year; to the intent they shall hire a Minister to say Divine Service there.\" from Faringdon Ward within.

The chief mason was Thomas Dunn.  Interior altered 1875-6 by William Butterfield.  In 1897-8 Bank Underground station was built beneath the church; the entrance (now out of use) by Sidney R. J. Smith is attached to the south faÃ§ade.EXTERIOR: Portland stone.  Square body, the west faÃ§ade featuring a projecting central bay with banded rustication, the cylindrical Tuscan columns at the angles banded with the same rustication.  Round-headed doorway with semi-circular window above; the window repeated on each side at clerestory level.  Broad shallow tower: the base with three unmoulded square windows; the principal storey of three bays with engaged Composite columns, surmounted by two square turrets with balustrades.  Low doorways flanking the tower give access to the galleries.  North elevation has five low blind apertures with heavy keystones on which sit smaller apertures, also blind.  Above three of these apertures (east, centre, and west) are complex aedicules placed within large round-headed rusticated frames: columns set diagonally support a straight entablature curving back; these in their turn frame niches containing a second arch, springing from the column bases, and above this a blank panel.  The treatment of this elevation has been described by John Summerson as 'a piece of sheer architectural eloquence hard to match' (Georgian London, 1945). The absence of windows on this wall insulated the interior from the noise of Lombard Street.  The lower part of the south elevation is now masked by the single-storey former Underground station entrance (with new vestry), in a style which pays tribute to Hawksmoor.  This elevation has five bays, of which only the westernmost is now visible to full height: a low aperture corresponds to those on the north elevation; above is a tall round-headed recess containing a framed blind opening surmounted by a round-headed window (this window is also blind; the windows of the other four bays light the church).INTERIOR: Square high space supported at each corner by three Corinthian columns, and lit by the large semi-circular windows above a straight entablature.  Rich plasterwork by Chrysostom Wilkins, incorporating palm fronds and cherubs.  Square ambulatory, formerly with galleries reached by doors in the west angles.  The galleries were made by John Meard and carved by Thomas Darby and Gervase Smith; they were taken down by Butterfield, who set their fronts against the walls.  In the shallow chancel an ornate wooden baldacchino with twisted columns and canopy ornamented with gilded cherubs, made by Meard and carved by Gabriel Appleby; Butterfield's raising of the chancel forced the baldacchino high into the elliptical chancel arch.  The polychromatic flooring of the chancel dates from 1875-6.  Original west organ gallery with organ case dated 1681; a second organ of 1913 is placed at east end of north aisle.  Pulpit of bulging form, made by Darby and Smith and inlaid with sunbursts by Appleby, the tester echoing the shape of the ceiling.  Wrought iron communion rails by John Robins.  A memorial tablet on the north wall to the church's most celebrated rector, John Newton, bears an epitaph written by Newton himself, which begins: 'John Newton, Clerk.  Once an infidel and libertine, a servant of slaves in Africa, was, by the rich mercy of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, preserved, restored, pardoned, and appointed to preach the faith he had long laboured to destroy.'SUBSIDIARY FEATURES:  Railings of c1900 at west end, extended to left and right c1992 when curved screen walls housing entrances to the Underground station were removed.HISTORY: The church is first recorded in 1191; the founder may have been a Saxon noble, Wulfnoth, possibly commemorated in the church's name.  Alternatively, the name may be connected with the wool trade; certainly this was true of the nearby church of St Mary Woolchurch Haw, destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666 (its parish then united with that of St Mary Woolnoth).  The full dedication of the church is to St Mary of the Nativity.  The advowson was given by the founder or his heirs to the Priory of St Helen, Bishopsgate; after the dissolution of the monasteries it reverted to Henry VIII, who gave it to Sir Martin Bowes of Lombard Street, a Goldsmith and in 1545-6, Lord Mayor.  The advowson passed from Bowes to the Goldsmiths' Company, and the patronage subsequently passed through various hands.  The church is the parish church of the Lord Mayors of London; the Mansion House stands almost opposite, on the site of St Mary Woolchurch Haw.  This association helped protect the church from repeated threats of demolition between 1863 and 1926, notably prior to the building of Bank Underground station in 1897.  (The crypt and plinth of the church were used as a booking hall in 1897-1900.)Excavations of c1716 uncovered remains thought to be Roman, and there is evidence of major Roman buildings in the immediate vicinity.  The early church was rebuilt during the course of the C15; the new building was consecrated in 1438, but additional work appears to have taken place towards the end of the century.  The church was damaged by the Great Fire of London, and was partially rebuilt by Christopher Wren in 1670-5.  A major contribution to the cost of this work was made by Sir Robert Vyner, Lord Mayor in 1674; the church was at one time known as Sir Robert Vyner's church.  Vyner is said to have had his own entrance to the east end of the church, a privilege inherited by the Post Office which subsequently stood on the site of his mansion in Lombard Street.  In 1708 the style of the church was described as 'modern Gothick' (Edward Hatton, A New View of London).In 1711 it was determined that a new church should be built under the 'Fifty New Churches' Act (it was the only church in the City to be built under the Act), but by 1712 the condition of the church was so dilapidated that the parishioners were afraid to worship there, and repairs to the existing structure were undertaken.  In 1716 drawings for the new building were prepared; Nicholas Hawksmoor was assisted by John James, who also had the title of surveyor, but principal responsibility for the design rests with Hawksmoor.  St Mary Woolnoth was Hawksmoor's only City church, and is the smallest he built; Kerry Downes has observed that it is perhaps the most powerful of his churches, because it is the most compact (Hawksmoor, 1959).  The new church first opened for worship on Easter Day 1727. From 1780 to 1807 the rector of St Mary Woolnoth was John Newton (1725-1807), the most celebrated priest associated with the church.  Newton, born the son of a master mariner in Wapping, spent the early part of his career as a slave trader.  From 1745-1754 he worked on slave ships, serving as captain on three voyages.  He was involved in every aspect of the slaver's trade, and his log books record the torture of rebellious slaves.  Following his conversion to devout Christianity in 1748 Newton became 'surveyor of tides' at Liverpool, devoting his spare time to private theological study.  He soon became one of the area's leading theological laymen, but for some time his radical reputation stood in the way of his finding employment in the Church of England.  Nevertheless, in 1764 he was made curate-in-charge at the church of Saints Peter and Paul, Olney, Buckinghamshire (q.v.).  That same year he published his autobiography, 'An Authentic Narrative', which established him as one of the leading figures of the evangelical revival.  Newton stayed at Olney for 16 years, winning fame as a preacher as well as a writer.  During the 1770s Newton worked with the poet William Cowper on a collection of 'Olney Hymns' (published 1779), the most famous of which was 'Amazing Grace' (the hymn, sung to a different tune, was to become associated with the struggle for equality in the southern states of America during the 1960s).  In 1780 Newton became rector of St Mary Woolnoth; his reputation grew in this cosmopolitan setting, and his status as a patriarch attracted large congregations.  In 1785-6 William Wilberforce came to him for advice during the crisis of his evangelical conversion; Newton counselled him to use political means to do God's work.  In Wilberforce's case, this would prove to be the campaign for abolition.  In 1788 Newton's pamphlet, 'Thoughts upon the African Slave Trade', revealed his past as a slave trader, condemned the trade, and expressed regret at his part in it.  Later that year Newton was amongst the witnesses called by the parliamentary select committee for examining the slave trade; Newton provided detailed evidence of the treatment and conditions suffered by slaves in transit.  In response to arguments about the economic advantages of slavery, Newton quoted, ' ''It is not lawful to put it into the Treasury, because it is the price of blood,'' ' [Matthew 27:6].  Newton's singular position as a figure of unimpeachable moral authority with first-hand experience of the slave trade made his contribution to the success of the abolition movement extremely valuable.  John Newton died in December 1807, shortly after the Abolition Act passed into law.  He was buried beside his wife in the crypt of St Mary Woolnoth, but the building of the Underground station led to both bodies being re-interred at Olney in 1893. SOURCES:  \nS Bradley and N.

    "wikipediaText": "St Mary Woolnoth is an Anglican church in the City of London, located on the corner of Lombard Street and King William Street near Bank junction. The present building is one of the Queen Anne Churches, designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor. The parish church continues to be actively used for services, with Holy Communion every Tuesday. St Mary Woolnoth lies in the ward of Langbourn.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nRoman remains were found under the site during the rebuilding by Hawksmoor, and there is speculation that there was a large Roman building in the immediate vicinity. This has led some to believe that the site has been used for worship for at least 2,000 years. This is based on the guess that the Roman remains were of a religious nature, and 'under the remains of an Anglo-Saxon wooden structure'. However, its name is first recorded in 1191 as Wilnotmaricherche.\nIt is believed that the name \"Woolnoth\" refers to a benefactor, possibly one Wulnoth de Walebrok who is known to have lived in the area earlier in the 12th century, or perhaps Wulfnoth Cild, a South Saxon nobleman and grandfather of King Harold Godwinson. Its full (and unusual) dedication is to Saint Mary of the Nativity.\nThe present building is at least the third church on the site. The Norman church survived until 1445, when it was rebuilt, with a spire added in 1485. It was badly damaged in 1666 in the Great Fire of London but was repaired by Sir Christopher Wren. Two new bells (the treble and the tenor) were cast in 1670, and in 1672 the middle bell was cast. The patched-up structure proved unsafe, however, and had to be demolished in 1711.\n\n\n=== Hawksmoor ===\n\nThe church was rebuilt by the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches. Work began in 1716 and the new church was reopened for worship on Easter Day 1727. It was commissioned from Nicholas Hawksmoor, who had responded with one of his most distinctive and original designs. He benefited greatly from having an unusually open area in which to work. The old church had been hemmed in by shops and houses, like many other City churches, but these were demolished at the same time as the church. Hawksmoor was thus able to fully exploit the unobstructed front of the site. St Mary Woolnoth is Hawksmoor's only City of London church.\nThe resultant church was something of an architectural statement on Hawksmoor's part. Its unusually imposing faÃ§ade, in English Baroque style, is dominated by two flat-topped turrets supported by columns of the Corinthian order, which are used throughout the church. The west side of the faÃ§ade, facing Lombard Street, has distinctive recesses bearing an inset forward-curving pediment resting on skewed columns.\nThe interior of the church is surprisingly spacious, despite its relatively small size. The layout is typical Hawksmoor, forming a \"cube within a cube\" â a square enclosed by three rows of four columns which is itself enclosed by a wider square. It is dominated by a baroque baldaquin, modelled on that of Bernini in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.\n\n\n=== Threatened demolition ===\n\nThe church underwent major changes in the late 19th century and the turn of the 20th century; it was proposed for demolition on several occasions but was saved each time. Its galleries were removed by William Butterfield in 1876, who thought they were unsafe, and a number of other significant (and not entirely successful) changes were made at the same time.\nBetween 1897 and 1900 the City & South London Railway (C&SLR) built Bank Underground station beneath the church. The C&SLR were given permission to demolish it, but public outcry forced them to reconsider: the company undertook to use only the subsoil instead. The crypt was sold to the railway and the bones were removed for reburial at Ilford. The walls and internal columns of the church were then supported on steel girders while the lift shafts and staircase shaft for Bank station were built directly beneath the church floor. At this time, the bells were also rehung with new fittings. No cracks formed in the plasterwork, and no settlement of the structure occurred; the company later claimed that the edifice of the church was considerably stronger than before.\n\n\n== Mid-twentieth century ==\nSt Mary Woolnoth was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950, and in 1952 became a guild church.\n\n\n== Present day ==\n\nSt Mary Woolnoth is the active parish church for the combined parish of St Edmund the King and Martyr, and St Mary Woolnoth Lombard Street with St Nicholas Acons, All Hallows Lombard Street, St Benet Gracechurch, St Leonard Eastcheap, St Dionis Backchurch and St Mary Woolchurch Haw â usually shortened to \"St Edmund & St Mary Woolnoth\" (the only two aforementioned churches to have survived). It is part of the Church of England's Diocese of London.\nIt is currently used by London's German-speaking Swiss community, and is also the official church in London of the government of British Columbia, Canada.\nThe 2013 boundary changes to the City's wards kept the church within Langbourn, despite the surrounding buildings being transferred to Candlewick and Walbrook wards, because of the church's strong connections with the ward.\n\n\n== Notable people associated with the church ==\n\nSir Martin Bowes, Lord Mayor (1545â46) and Mint Master, was married and buried here, and his children and grandchildren baptized.\nThomas Kyd, Elizabethan dramatist, was baptised here; his father Francis was also a churchwarden.\nJosias Shute was rector here from 1611.\nRalph Robinson was presbyterian minister here in the 1640s.\nWilliam Owtram was rector here.\nThomas Busby the composer was organist here from 1798.\nJohn Newton, evangelical, anti-slavery campaigner and hymnist, was incumbent here from 1780 to 1807.\nWilliam Wilberforce, anti-slavery campaigner, worshipped here.\nEdward Lloyd, founder of Lloyd's of London, is memorialised here.\nWilliam Josiah Irons the theologian was rector here from 1872.\nSir William Phips was buried here.18 February 1694/5\nAnne (Marbury) Hutchinson, noted American colonial woman, married William Hutchinson here in 1612.\nThomas Ritchie, born 23 March 1809, a founder of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, was baptised here.\n\n\n== Literary reference ==\nT. S. Eliot refers to this church in a famous passage of his 1922 poem The Waste Land, Part 1, 'The Burial of the Dead':\n\nA crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,\nI had not thought death had undone so many.\nSighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,\nAnd each man fixed his eyes before his feet.\nFlowed up the hill and down King William Street,\nTo where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours\nWith a dead sound on the final stroke of nine.\nThere I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying, \"Stetson!\nYou who were with me in the ships at Mylae!\n\nIn his notes to the poem Eliot remarks that the \"dead sound on the final stroke of nine\" was \"A phenomenon which I have often noticed.\"\nSt Mary Woolnoth is an important historical site in Peter Ackroyd's 1985 novel Hawksmoor where it is the scene of one of a series of murders all taking place at churches redesigned by Nicholas Hawksmoor, who is given the fictional name Nicholas Dyer.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of churches in London\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\nBetjeman, John (1967).

    "wikipediaText": "The Guild Church of St Katharine Cree is an Anglican church in the Aldgate ward of the City of London, on the north side of Leadenhall Street near Leadenhall Market. It was founded in 1280. The present building dates from 1628 to 1630. Formerly a parish church, it is now a guild church.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Former building ===\nThe parish served by the church existed by 1108, when it was served by the Augustinian Holy Trinity Priory, Aldgate, also called Christ Church, which was founded by Maud, queen at the time of King Henry I. The parishioners used the priory church but this proved unsatisfactory and disruptive to the priory's activities.\nThe prior partly resolved the problem in 1280 by founding St Katharine Cree as a separate church for the parishioners. The site of the present church was originally in the priory's churchyard and it is possible that the church began as a cemetery chapel. It took its name from the priory, \"Cree\" being abstracted from forms like Crichurch, which were abbreviations of \"Christ Church\" (H.A. Harben, A Dictionary of London (1918)). It was initially served by a canon appointed by the prior but this did not prove satisfactory either, so, in 1414, the church was established as a parish church in its own right. The present tower was added about 1504.\nDescribing the building at the end of the 16th century, John Stow wrote:\n\nthis church seemeth to be very old; since the building whereof the high street hath been so often raised by pavements that now men are fain to descend into the said church by divers steps, seven in number.\n\n\n=== Current building ===\n\nThe present church was built in 1628â30, retaining the Tudor tower of its predecessor. It is larger than the previous church, incorporating a piece of ground previously occupied by a cloister on the north side, and the floor level is considerably higher. The rebuilt church was consecrated by William Laud, Bishop of London on 31 January 1631. His vestments and the form of service that he used for the consecration were later held against him in his trial and conviction for heresy, when Puritans accused him of having displayed Catholic sympathies through his \"bowings and cringings\". He is commemorated by a chapel in the church.\nThe church escaped the Great Fire of London in 1666 and suffered only minor damage in the London Blitz of the Second World War. However, structural problems required extensive restoration in 1962. It is now one of the city's Guild churches.\nSt Katharine Cree is a significant church of the Jacobean period, a time when few new churches were built. It is the only Jacobean church to have survived in London. The identity of its architect is unknown. It has a high nave, linked with the narrow aisles by arcades supported on Corinthian columns. The church is 31 yards (28 m) long and 17 yards (16 m) wide; the height to the ceiling of the nave is 37 feet (11 m).\n\nThe chancel has a rose window, reputedly modelled on the much larger one in Old St Paul's Cathedral (destroyed in the Great Fire). The window and its stained glass are original, dating from 1630. The baptismal font dates from around 1640. The vaulted ceiling bears bosses of the arms of 16 of the city's livery companies and of the City of London itself. From the east end the bosses are:\n\nNorth Aisle â Mercers, Drapers, Skinners, Salters, Dyers and Pewterers\nNave â The City of London, Fishmongers, Merchant Taylors, Ironmongers, Clothworkers and Leathersellers\nSouth Aisle â Grocers, Goldsmiths, Haberdashers, Vinters and Brewers\nThe present scheme dates mostly from the restoration of 1972. Tradition says that these Companies used St Katharine Cree for a time after the Great Fire of London of 1666, while their own Guild Churches were being rebuilt. \nThe church is a Grade I listed building.\nBy the south wall of St Katharine's is a memorial to RMS Lancastria, a troopship sunk at sea with huge loss of life during the Second World War in 1940. It includes a model of the ship and the ship's bell.\nSt Katharine's has a ring of six bells. Lester and Pack of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast five of them including the treble bell in 1754. Thomas II Mears of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the tenor bell in 1842. The church clock has a bell, also cast by Lester and Pack in 1754. In the summer of 2007 they were rung for the first time since 1880. An appeal to raise Â£60,000 to restore the bells to full ringing order was launched in November 2007, and the project was completed in 2009. It is the only tower in the City where the bells are rung from a ground-floor ringing chamber.\nToday St Katharine's is a guild church and has no parish, but chose some years ago to dedicate its ministry to the worlds of finance, commerce and industry.\n\n\n== Notable people associated with the church ==\n\nStephen Charnock (1628â80), Puritan Presbyterian clergyman and theologian, was born in the parish.\nHans Holbein the Younger's grave (died 1543) has been claimed by both St Andrew Undershaft church and by St Katharine Cree. St Katharine Cree's claim is stronger because the nearby abbey had been recently destroyed, while St Andrew Undershaft's graveyard was already full.\nBoth Henry Purcell and George Frideric Handel played the organ at the church.\nSir Nicholas Throckmorton (died 1571), diplomat and ambassador, is buried in the church.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nLion sermon\nList of buildings that survived the Great Fire of London\nList of churches and cathedrals of London\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nAlberge, Dalya (21 December 2016). \"London church to be reunited with stolen 16th-century carving\".

    "wikipediaText": "St Edmund, King and Martyr, is an Anglican church in Lombard Street, in the City of London, dedicated to St Edmund the Martyr. From 2001 it housed the London Centre for Spirituality, renamed the London Centre for Spiritual Direction, but is still a consecrated church. Since 2019, Imprint Church organises regular worship inside of the building.\nThe church lies in the ward of Langbourn, and has a ward noticeboard outside.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1292, the church is first recorded as 'Saint Edmund towards Garcherche', and it reappears in 1348 as 'Saint Edmund in Lombardestrete'.  John Stow, in his Survey of London 1598, revised during 1603, refers to it also as St Edmund Grass Church.\nThe medieval church was destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666.  After the fire the parish was united with that of St Nicholas Acons, which was also destroyed and not rebuilt. The present church was constructed to the designs of Sir Christopher Wren in 1670â1679, with a tower ornamented at the angles by flaming urns in allusion to the Great Fire. George Godwin described the tower as \"more Chinese than Italian\", while James Peller Malcolm called it \"rather handsome, but of that species of architecture which is difficult to describe so as to be understood\". The orientation of the church is unusual, with the altar towards the north, instead of east.\nThe essayist Joseph Addison  was married here in 1716.\nIn September 1868 a riot occurred outside the church, as a consequence of one of a series of Friday morning sermons given by the Rev. J. L. Lyne â known as \"Father Ignatius\" â in which he had spoken disparagingly of the traders of Lombard Street.\nThe church was restored in 1864 and 1880. On 7 July 1917, during the second daylight air raid by Gotha bombers of the England Squadron, a high explosive bomb landed on St Edmund's, destroying the main beam of the roof; extensive repair and restoration was required and it did not reopen until 1 October 1919. Some fragments of the German bomb are preserved in the church. Further damage was caused by incendiary bombs during the 1941 London Blitz.\nThe church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.\n\n\n== Previous rectors ==\nRectors of the church have included Thomas Lyndford, chaplain in ordinary to George I, and Jeremiah Milles, president of the Society of Antiquaries. After the Great War, Studdert Kennedy was given charge of St Edmund, King and Martyr. He moved to work for the Industrial Christian Fellowship, for whom he went on speaking tours of Britain. It was on one of these tours that he was taken ill. He died in Liverpool in 1929, exhausted at the age of 45, and poor people flocked to his funeral in Worcester, for the Dean of Westminster refused burial at the Abbey because, he said, Studdert Kennedy was a \"socialist\".\n\n\n== Present day ==\nThe church and parish now forms part of the combined parish of St Edmund the King and Martyr, and St Mary Woolnoth Lombard Street with St Nicholas Acons, All Hallows Lombard Street, St Benet Gracechurch, St Leonard Eastcheap, St Dionis Backchurch and St Mary Woolchurch Haw â usually shortened to \"St Edmund & St Mary Woolnoth\"  (the only two aforementioned churches to have survived). It is part of the Church of England's Diocese of London. and accommodates the office of the Bishop of Islington.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of Christopher Wren churches in London\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nThe London Centre for Spiritual Direction"

    "wikipediaText": "All Hallows-on-the-Wall is a Church of England church located in the City of London. Its name refers to its location, inside and adjacent to London Wall, the former city wall.\n\n\n== Current use ==\nFrom 2014 All Hallows became the headquarters of the urban youth charity XLP, and the home of City Gates Church, London. XLP creates positive futures for young people in impoverished urban areas. It combats bullying and intimidation, weapons, and gangs. It develops a response to boredom due to a lack of organised activities, absent parents, and living in areas with a high crime rate. The church is often used to host XLP events and has received an annual visit from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.\nCity Gates Church is a congregation with roots in the British New Church Movement, and Ichthus Christian Fellowship. It meets at All Hallows at 11am every week, and is the first community to hold regular services there since 1941. City Gates builds on All Hallowsâ previous traditions of serving the poor. It runs the Better Job Project, English Conversation Classes, live music nights and other events. Covid19 brought activities to a halt. The church resumed its meetings in September 2021, and returned to serving the community with its projects in December 2022.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe present church was constructed by George Dance the Younger in 1767, replacing an earlier church built some time in the early 12th century on a bastion of the old Roman wall. It became renowned for its hermits, who lived in cells in the church. All Hallows escaped destruction in the Great Fire of London in 1666 due to its position under the wall, but subsequently fell into dereliction.\nDance rebuilt the church when he was only 24 years old. He had recently returned from Italy where he had conducted detailed studies of Classical buildings. The new All Hallows took its inspiration from the Classical world and was remarkably simple in form, with no aisles; its interior consists solely of a barrel-vaulted nave with a half-dome apse at the far end, with decoration deriving from the ancient Temple of Venus and Rome in the city of Rome. Attached Ionic columns  support a frieze, rather than the usual entablature. The exterior is plain and of brick, except for the stone-faced tower above the porch at the west end.\nThe church was noted for its work in offering its services to the poor; many workers, including women in domestic service, would take the early trains into the City to avoid peak fares. A demand for services and refreshment in the Parish led to the vicar of the church, the Reverend Sir Montague Fowler, 4th Baronet, third son of Sir John Fowler, to operate services for their benefit. This was a popular initiative (which also had tents constructed in the churchyard to provide refreshments) which led to the construction of the buildings behind the church which were to be used as an educational institute. Because of this the church had one of the largest congregations in the City at a time when many City churches were beginning to seem redundant.\nAll Hallows was damaged during the Second World War but was restored in the early 1960s. It is a guild church associated with the Worshipful Company of Carpenters, which has held its annual elections in the church for over 600 years. Until 1994, it was the headquarters of the Council for the Care of Churches. On 14 December 1994 the Council for the Care of Churches and the Cathedrals Fabric Commission for England moved out of All Hallows, leaving the church empty for two and a half years. Then in April 1997 the London and South East Team of Christian Aid were given use of the building and Garth Hewitt, the Team Leader, was appointed Guild Vicar and licensed by the Bishop of London on 18 June 1997. All Hallows went on to become the centre of a thriving community for Christian Aid and its supporters, becoming a centre for issues of Justice, Development and Peace. Under the wing of Christian Aid other organisations have been based at All Hallows, including the Community Fundraising Unit of Christian Aid, the Amos Trust (a small charity with a commitment to justice issues), The Time of Our Lives (the archbishop of Canterbury's Millennium youth event organised from the crypt of All Hallows), and Greenbelt festivals  (an arts festival with a Christian viewpoint and a partner of Christian Aid).\nThe church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.\n\n\n== Notable parishioners ==\nRobert Woodford, a lawyer who is best known as the author of an extensive diary that covers the period 1637-1641, married Hannah Haunch at All Hallows in 1635.\nSamuel John Stone was Rector of All Hallows until 1900.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of churches and cathedrals of London\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAll Hallows-on-the-Wall website\nXLP\nCity Gates Church\nLocation map (Multimap.com)"

    "wikipediaText": "St Margaret Lothbury is a Church of England parish church on Lothbury in the City of London; it spans the boundary between Coleman Street Ward and Broad Street Ward. Recorded since the 12th century, the church was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666 and rebuilt by the office of Sir Christopher Wren. St Margaret Lothbury still serves as a parish church, as well as being the official church of five Livery Companies, two Ward Clubs and two Professional Institutes. It also has connections with many local finance houses, all of which hold special services each year.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest mention of St Margaret Lothbury is from 1185. The patronage of the church belonged to the abbess and convent of Barking, Essex until the Dissolution, when it passed to the Crown.\nIt was rebuilt in 1440, mostly at the expense of Robert Large, who was Lord Mayor that year and is remembered as the Master of whom William Caxton served his apprenticeship. It suffered as did so many of London's churches in the Great Fire of London of 1666 and was rebuilt by Christopher Wren from 1686 to 1690.\nIn 1781 the parish of the church of St Christopher le Stocks, demolished to make way for an extension to the Bank of England, was united with that of St Margaret Lothbury.\n\n\n== Interior ==\n\nThe church has exceptionally fine 17th-century woodwork from other now-demolished Wren churches. Among the best are the \nreredos, communion rails and baptismal font, which are thought to be by Grinling Gibbons from St Olave, Old Jewry, the pulpit sounding board and the rood screen from All-Hallows-the-Great. Two paintings of Moses and Aaron flank the high altar, and came from St Christopher le Stocks when it was demolished in 1781. The organ was built by George Pike England in 1801. It was restored in 1984, stands in its original case  and contains nearly all its original pipework.\nThe church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of churches and cathedrals of London\nList of Christopher Wren churches in London\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nSt Margaret Lothbury and St Mary Woolnoth\n360Â° panorama inside St Margaret Lothbury"

    "wikipediaText": "Holy Sepulchre London, formerly and in some official uses Saint Sepulchre-without-Newgate, is the largest Anglican parish church in the City of London. It stands on the north side of Holborn Viaduct across a crossroads from the Old Bailey, and its parish takes in Smithfield Market. During medieval times, the site lay outside (\"without\") the city wall, west of the Newgate.\nIt has London's musicians' chapel in which a book of remembrance sits and an October/November requiem takes place â unusual for a church associated with Low Church Evangelicalism. The church has two local army regiment memorials.\nThe vicar is appointed by St John's College, Oxford, which has held the church's patronage since 1622.\nThe church is within the Newgate Street Conservation Area.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe original (probably pre-Norman) church on the site was dedicated to St Edmund the King and Martyr. In 1137 it was given to the Priory of St Bartholomew. During the Crusades of that century the church was re-dedicated to Saint Edmund and the Holy Sepulchre, venerating the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. Knights passed by on the way to the Holy Lands. This name became contracted, and in the 21st century reference to the saint-king has been overwhelmingly dropped. The very early lessening of the first dedication helped to reserve that name for the small church to the east of St Paul's Cathedral dedicated\nto St Edmund, King and Martyr.\nThe church is today the largest parish church in the city. It was completely rebuilt in the 15th century but was gutted by the Great Fire of London in 1666, which left the outer walls, the tower and the porch standing. It was rebuilt 1667â1679 by Joshua Marshall, the King's Master Mason, and appears to be remodelled to Marshall's own design. Lightly modified in the 18th century, the interior of the church is a wide, roomy space with a coffered ceiling installed in 1834 with plasterwork of three years later. The church underwent considerable re-facing and alterations in 1878. During the Second World War the 18th-century watch-house, built in the churchyard to deter grave-robbers, was bomb-struck but later  rebuilt. The vicarage was fully renovated in the early 2000s.\n\nDuring Mary I's persecutions, in 1555, the incumbent vicar John Rogers was burned at the stake as a heretic.\n\n\n=== Bells ===\nThe bells are referred to in the nursery rhyme Oranges and Lemons as the \"bells of Old Bailey\".\nIn 1605, London merchant tailor  John Dowe paid the parish Â£50 (equivalent to Â£14,000 in 2023) to buy a handbell and to mark the execution of prisoners at the nearby gallows at Newgate. This execution bell is displayed in a glass case in the nave. Between the 17th and 19th centuries, the clerk was responsible for ringing it outside the condemned man's cell in Newgate Prison the night before his execution, and announcing the following \"wholesome advice\":\n\nAll you that in the condemned hold do lie,\nPrepare you, for to-morrow you shall die;\nWatch all, and pray, the hour is drawing near\nThat you before the Almighty must appear;\nExamine well yourselves, in time repent,\nThat you may not to eternal flames be sent.\nAnd when St Sepulchre's bell to-morrow tolls,\nThe Lord above have mercy on your souls.\nPast twelve o'clock!\n\nGiven proximity to Newgate Prison and the Old Bailey, built on the site of the prison, certain of the bells in its tower, aside from marking time, celebrating weddings and communion, were rung to announce executions. In the first years of the court this was as the condemned felon was led to Tyburn.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Musicians' Chapel ===\nBy the north aisle is the Musicians' Chapel. As St Stephen's chapel it hosted votive masses to the 12th-century monastic saint Stephen Harding prior to the English Reformation and during the reign of Mary I of England.\nThe ashes of conductor Sir Henry Wood, founder of The Proms, who learnt to play the organ at the church as a boy, were interred here in the 1940s.\nIt was rededicated to musicians by Dr. W.R. Matthews, Dean of St Paul's, on 2 January 1955 in the presence of many distinguished musicians including an orchestra conducted by Sir Malcolm Sargent and the BBC Singers.  Its four windows commemorate Sir Henry Wood, John Ireland,\nDame Nellie Melba and\nWalter Carroll\nThe chapel's appearance and the Musicians' Book of Remembrance are maintained by the Friends of the Musicians' Chapel. A Service of Thanksgiving for all those in the book is held at the church each year as well as a requiem close to All Souls' Day. Many concerts and memorial events for musicians have been held in the church. In 2017 the vicar ceased parish funds financing the requiem and allowing of most free rehearsing time. A protest was held and many prominent musicians including John Rutter sought continued benevolence from the wider congregation and church patron. Attempts to mediate failed.\n\n\n=== Army memorials ===\nThe south aisle of the church holds the regimental chapel of the Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment) (merged to form the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers), to whom its gardens are a memorial. The west end of the north aisle has memorials for the City of London Rifles (the 6th Battalion London Regiment).\n\n\n== Protection and recognition of architecture ==\nThe church has been designated a Grade I listed building (the highest grade) since 1950.\n\n\n== Notable people associated with the church ==\nThomas Culpeper, Tudor courtier, buried here\nThomas Gouge, minister ejected in 1662\nSamuel Gurney, MP, erected the first drinking fountain for the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association on the railings of the church. It was restored to the original location in 1913 and remains there.\nRev Dr Peter Mullen, commentator, author and former rector, sometime chaplain to the London Stock Exchange\nJohn Rogers, minister, Bible translator, and the first English Protestant martyr under Mary I of England; he was burnt at the stake\nSir Anthony St Leger, Tudor judge, and his first wife Eleanor Markham, buried here\nSir John Smith, governor of Virginia and associate of Pocahontas, buried 1631 in the south aisle. Smith is also commemorated by a window designed by Francis Skeat and installed in 1968.\nAustin Osman Spare, artist, attended the church school, now a physiotherapy centre, behind the church in Snow Hill Court\nRoger Williams (1603â1683), founder of Rhode Island, USA\nSir Henry Wood, founding conductor at the Proms\nCharles Wriothesley, long-serving officer of arms at the College of Arms, buried 1562 in the middle aisle\n\n\n== Organ ==\n\nThe north aisle is dominated by a splendid organ built by Renatus Harris in 1670; the organ case is its sole mention in the architectural listing, adding a date, 1677.\nThe swell was added by John Byfield in c.â1730. The organ was enlarged in 1817 by James Hancock and by John Gray in 1828 and 1835, and Gray and Davison in 1849, 1852 and 1855. It was rebuilt in 1932 by Harrison and Harrison. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.  It is not currently playable, though efforts are being made to restore it to a playable condition. A Makin digital organ is used when required for services.\nThe choir has now composed of eight professional singers.\n\n\n=== Organists ===\n\nFrancis Forcer 1676â1704\nThomas Deane 1705â1712\nBenjamin Short 1712â1760\nWilliam Selby and Samuel Jarvis 1760â1773\nSamuel Jarvis 1773â1784\nGeorge Cooper 1784â1799\nGeorge Cooper 1799â1843 (son of above)\nGeorge Cooper 1843â1876 (son of above)\nJames Loaring\nEdwin Matthew Lott\nEdgar Pettman\nFrank B. Fowle c.â1921\nPeter Asprey (Director of Music; present)\nJoshua Ryan (Organist elect; from May 2022)\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of churches and cathedrals of London\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nSt Sepulchre-without-Newgate church website\nSt Sepulchre-without-Newgate at Find a Grave"

Restoration by Seeley and Paget following bomb damage, completed 1961. MATERIALS: Portland stone, with copper-covered roof.PLAN: aisled nave of seven bays with a shallow chancel and west tower, the tower flanked by vestibules and the chancel by vestries. EXTERIOR: the tower retains its C15 angle buttresses and pointed lower windows. The balustraded top stage is an addition of 1703-4, with pinnacles with vases. The towerâs large upper windows have a segmental pediment on pilasters within a round-headed frame. On the west front are statues of schoolchildren from the former Parish School in Hatton Garden. The main body of the church is balustraded, having two tiers of windows, with large round-headed openings over segmental ones, or pedimented doorways in the end bays. The low vestries to the east are domed. INTERIOR: Wrenâs lofty barrel-vaulted interior was faithfully recreated by the C20 restoration, with groin-vaults over the aisles on Corinthian columns rising from the gallery fronts. There is a two-storeyed Venetian window to the chancel. The circular skylight over the chancel was probably introduced by J.H. Good during alterations of 1818. All the furnishings were introduced to the church in the C20, some from other historic churches. The C19 font and pulpit, and the late-C20 organ in a mid-C18 case given by George Frederic Handel, came from the chapel of the Foundling Hospital in Coramâs Fields, demolished in 1926; Thomas Coramâs tomb was brought here in 1961. The altar rails and part of the reredos come from the Church of St Luke, Old Street. Other fittings are by Seeley and Paget.HISTORYExcavation of the crypt in 2001 revealed Roman remains, dating between AD 150 and 300, suggesting that the site was in use at this time. King Edgarâs renewal of the Charter of Westminster Abbey circa 959 mentions a timber church in this position, which was replaced by a stone church in the mid-C15. By the late C17, the church had become ruinous, and although outside the area burned by the Great Fire of 1666, was re-built by Sir Christopher Wren together with 50 City churches destroyed by the fire. The C15 tower was kept, being refaced and raised in 1703-4. In 1818 John Henry Good was appointed to repair the church and undertake alterations, including the creation of a new gallery at the west end of the church, later removed. The construction of Holborn Viaduct from 1863 led to the removal of the parish court house and rectory to the west of the church; Samuel Sanders Teulon was commissioned to build replacements: the Gothic rectory, court house and vestry clerkâs office of 1868-71, built around a courtyard to the south, and listed at Grade II. Teulon also undertook a restoration of the church interior in 1869-72, though nothing is thought to remain from this phase. The church was struck by an incendiary bomb on 16 April 1941, and very badly damaged; restoration work by Seeley and Paget was completed in 1961. Notable figures associated with the church include John Gerard, the herbalist, who was buried here in 1618, and Benjamin Disraeli, the future prime minster, who was baptised here as a twelve-year-old in 1817. The church is now the headquarters church of the Royal College of Organists.Amongst a number of points of historic interest, the Church of St Andrew is associated with a very significant moment in the history of Black presence in Britain, through the baptism in 1771 of James Somerset. Somerset had been enslaved in Africa and sold in Virginia to Charles Stewart, a colonial customs official, who regarded him as his property for 20 years. Somerset was brought to London by Stewart in 1769, and on 12 February 1771 was baptised at the Church of St Andrew, Holborn. Having left Stewartâs service in October 1771, Somerset was seized by Stewart and confined in irons aboard a ship bound for Jamaica on 26 November.Â  Somersetâs white godparents, who had welcomed him into the Church at St Andrewâs, secured a writ of habeas corpus from Lord Mansfield, demanding that he be presented to the court. Somerset then persuaded Granville Sharp, by then well known for his passionate dedication to the campaign against slavery, to support his cause. The Somerset case opened in January 1772, with eight separate hearings leading up to the final decision in June of that year. The argument centred on the question of whether slavery was legal in England, and whether an English court should uphold colonial laws which did not have an English parallel. Â The final ruling on 22 June 1772 asserted that slavery lacked a firm foundation in English law, and therefore was understood by many at the time to grant freedom not only to James Somerset, but to all enslaved Black people in Britain. It was a significant milestone on the long road to Britainâs abolition of the slave trade in1807, and of slavery itself in 1833.This List entry has been amended in 2020 to commemorate the anniversary on 22 June 1772 of the Somerset ruling, a significant legal landmark in the campaign against slavery.\n\n        \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n    \n        Legacy\n    \n    \n        The contents of this record have been generated from a legacy data system.\n    \n    \n        \n            Legacy System number:\n            \n                199521\n            \n        \n        \n            Legacy System:\n            \n                LBS\n            \n        \n    \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n                    Sources\n                \n                \n                    Books and journalsBradley, S, Pevsner, N, The Buildings of England, London1: The City of London, (2002), 190-191Olusoga, D, Black and British: A Forgotten History, (2016)Schama,   Simon, Rough Crossings: Britain, the Slaves and the American Revolution , (2005)WebsitesGuildhall Library Manuscripts, accessed 16 June 2020 from https://archives.history.ac.uk/guildhallmanuscripts/strong.htmHistory - St Andrew Holborn , accessed 16 June 2020 from https://www.standrewholborn.org.uk/history.phpNational Archives, accessed 18 June 2020 from https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/blackhistory/rights/slave_free.htm Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, entry for Granville Sharp , accessed 18 June 2020 from https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/25208Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, entry for William Murray, first earl of Mansfield , accessed 18 June 2020 from https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/19655\n                \n\n\n\n                    \n                        \n\n\n    \n        Legal\n    \n\n\n    \n        This building is listed under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as amended for its special architectural or historic interest.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n\n            \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n            \n                Map\n            \n            \n                This map is for quick reference purposes only and may not be to scale.

    "wikipediaText": "The Church of St Andrew, Holborn, is a Church of England church on the northwestern edge of the City of London, on Holborn within the Ward of Farringdon Without.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman and medieval ===\nRoman pottery was found on the site during 2001/02 excavations in the crypt. However, the first written record of the church itself is dated as 951 (DCCCCLI) in a charter of Westminster Abbey, referring to it as the \"old wooden church\", on top of the hill above the river Fleet. The Charter's authenticity has been called into question because the date is not within the reign of the King Edgar of England who is granting it. It may be that this is simply a scribal error and that the date should be '959' (DCCCCLIX). A 'Master Gladwin', i.e. a priest, held it after the Norman Conquest and he assigned it to St Paul's Cathedral, but with the proviso that the advowson be granted at 12 pence a year to the Cluniac Order's, St Saviour's foundation of what was to become Bermondsey Abbey. This assignment dates between 1086 and 1089. In about 1200 a deed was witnessed by James, the Parson, Roger, his chaplain, Andrew, the Deacon and also Alexander his clerk. In 1280 one Simon de Gardino bequeathed funds towards the building of a belfry, it is assumed this would be stone and that there were due to be bells to be cast for it.\nIn the Early Middle Ages the church is referred to as St Andrew Holburnestrate and later simply as St Andrew de Holeburn.\nIn 1348, John Thavie, a local armourer, \"left a considerable Estate towards the support of the fabric forever\", a legacy which survived the English Reformation, was invested carefully through the centuries, and still provides for the church's current upkeep. In the 15th century, the wooden church was replaced by a medieval stone one. On 8 July 1563, during a severe storm, the steeple of the church was struck and badly damaged by lightning.\nAfter being executed by hanging for the crime of serving at a Catholic Mass, St. Swithin Wells was buried in the churchyard on 10 December 1591.\n\n\n=== 16th to 18th century ===\nThe medieval St Andrew's survived the 1666 Great Fire of London, saved by a last minute change in wind direction, but was already in a bad state of repair and so was rebuilt by Christopher Wren anyway. In what is his largest parish church, he rebuilt from the foundations (creating the present crypt) and gave the existing medieval stone tower (the only medieval part to survive) a marble cladding. Its rector from 1713 to 1724 was Henry Sacheverell, who is buried beneath the church's altar.\n\nIn 1741, the philanthropic sea captain Thomas Coram set up the Foundling Hospital for abandoned children in a house in nearby Hatton Garden. The following year, the charity moved to new premises in Bloomsbury and remained there until 1935.\nThe church of St George the Martyr Holborn was built between 1703 and 1706, as a chapel of ease for the parish. It became a parish church in its own right in 1723.\nOn November 1, 1799, Marc Isambard Brunel married Sophia Kingdom at the church.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nIn 1808, writer William Hazlitt married Sarah Stoddart, with Charles Lamb as his best man, and Mary Lamb as a bridesmaid. The twelve-year-old Benjamin Disraeli, the future Prime Minister, was received into the Christian Church in 1817.\nIt was on the church's steps in 1828 that the surgeon William Marsden found a homeless girl suffering from hypothermia, and sought help for her from one of the nearby hospitals. However, none would take her in, and she died in Marsden's arms; the horror of the experience inspired him to establish the Royal Free Hospital for the poor and destitute. Today the hospital is located in Hampstead.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, the Holborn Valley Improvement Scheme bought up the church's North Churchyard. Many of the bodies were re-interred: some in the crypt, and others at the City of London Cemetery in Ilford (the latter also being the destination for the bodies from the crypt when it was cleared in 2002â2003) to make way for the Holborn Viaduct, linking Holborn with Newgate, which was opened by Queen Victoria in 1869.\nAs part of this improvement scheme the church received compensation to replace its assets, and the Gothic architect Samuel Sanders Teulon was commissioned to build a new rectory and courthouse on the south side of the church â this now operates as the offices for the foundation, the associated charities and the Archdeaconry of Hackney, as well as the rectory and the conference rooms. Teulon incorporated into the courtroom, the building's main room, a 17th-century fireplace. This was from the 'Quest Room' for the 'below Bars' part of the parish, i.e. that lies outside the city boundary, sited as part of a block of buildings in the middle of the main street. This block was removed as part of the Holborn Viaduct improvements and explains why Holborn is so wide at this point.\nIn Charles Dickens's Oliver Twist Bill Sykes looks up at this church's tower (an episode referenced by Iris Murdoch in Under the Net, though from where her character stands such a view is almost impossible).  In Dickens' Bleak House, Mr Snagsby's deceased partner, Peffer, is buried in the churchyard of St Andrew's.\n\n\n=== 20th century to present ===\n\nDuring the London Blitz, on the night of 7 May 1941, the church was bombed and gutted by German bombs, leaving only the exterior walls and tower. However, instead of demolition which sometimes occurred in similar cases, it was decided after a long delay that it would be restored \"stone for stone and brick for brick\" to Wren's original designs. The church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.\nThe church contains stained glass and a mural â depicting the Holy Spirit as a dove â by Brian Thomas.\nIn 1955, the Foundling Hospital, which had originally been founded in St Andrew's parish, sold its premises at Ashlyns School in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire. It was decided to transfer a number of items from the Hospital chapel in Berkhamsted back to London, including the mortal remains of Thomas Coram, the Hospital founder, which were exhumed and placed in a tomb in St Andrew's. The casing of the organ, which had originally been given to the Foundling Hospital by George Frideric Handel, was also dismantled and installed in St Andrew's, along with the pulpit and the baptismal font.\nThe church re-opened in 1961 as a non-parochial Guild Church intended for serving the local working rather than resident community which had declined as had the City's population as a whole.\nIn January 2005 a new large icon was installed, made for the site by the Monastic Family Fraternity of Jesus in Vallechiara. The church runs a selection of recitals and lectures, as well as weekly services and evening concerts.\nIn August 2010, St Andrew Holborn's Icon Cross became motorised, allowing the large icon of Jesus on the Cross to be raised and lowered for services.\nIn September 2017 controversy occurred when a London Fashion Week show which took place at the church included runway models sporting satanic images and symbols.\n\n\n=== Rectors of St Andrew Holborn ===\n\nâ  Rector died in post\n\n\n== Organ ==\n\nThe organ in St Andrew's is a 20th-century instrument in an 18th-century casing. It was built by Mander Organs in 1989 and is mounted in the west gallery. The upper part of the organ casing incorporates the original casework from the 1750 organ built for the Foundling Hospital chapel in Bloomsbury to a design by Handel. In 1935 it was installed in Ashlyns School chapel in Berkhamsted before being dismantled and re-installed in St Andrew, Holborn.\n\n\n=== Organists ===\nDaniel Purcell 1713â1717 (younger brother or possibly cousin of the composer Henry Purcell\nMaurice Greene 1717â1718\nJohn Isham 1718â1726\nJohn Stanley 1726â1786 (organist at St Andrew's from the age of 14, replaced Handel as a governor of the Foundling Hospital after Handel's death (thus continuing the tradition of performing the Messiah for the Hospital) and died near the church in Hatton Garden)\nJames Evance 1786â1811\nJohn Grosvenor 1811â1814\nJ.

    "wikipediaText": "The Temple Church, a royal peculiar in the Church of England, is a church in the Inner and Middle Temples located between Fleet Street and the River Thames, built by the Knights Templar for their English headquarters in the Temple precinct. It was consecrated on 10 February 1185 by Patriarch Heraclius of Jerusalem. During the reign of King John (1199â1216) it served as the royal treasury, supported by the role of the Knights Templar as proto-international bankers. It is now jointly owned by the Inner Temple and Middle Temple Inns of Court, bases of the English legal profession. It is famous for being a round church, a common design feature for Knights Templar churches, and for its 13th- and 14th-century stone effigies. It was heavily damaged by German bombing during World War II and has since been greatly restored and rebuilt.\nThe area around the Temple Church is still known as the Temple. Temple Bar, a jurisdictional gateway, stood in the middle of Fleet Street in the Temple area. Nearby is Temple Underground station.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Construction ===\nIn the mid-12th century, before the construction of the church, the Knights Templar in London had met at a site in High Holborn in a structure originally established by Hugues de Payens (the site had been historically the location of a Roman temple in Londinium, now known as London). Because of the rapid growth of the order, by the 1160s the site had become too confined, and the order purchased the current site for the establishment of a larger monastic complex as their headquarters in England. In addition to the church, the new compound originally contained residences, military training facilities, and recreational grounds for the military brethren and novices, who were not permitted to go into the City without the permission of the Master of the Temple.\nThe church building comprises two separate sections: The original circular church building, called the Round Church and now acting as a nave, and a later rectangular section adjoining on the east side, built approximately half a century later, forming the chancel.\n\nAfter the capture of Jerusalem in 1099 by the Crusaders, the Dome of the Rock was given to the Augustinians, who turned it into a church (while the Jami Al-Aqsa became a royal palace). Because the Dome of the Rock was the site of the Temple of Solomon, the Knights Templar set up their headquarters in the Al-Aqsa Mosque adjacent to the Dome for much of the 12th century. The Templum Domini, as they called the Dome of the Rock, featured on the official seals of the order's Grand Masters (such as Everard des Barres and Renaud de Vichiers), and along with the Church of the Holy Sepulchre upon which it was based soon became the architectural model for Round Templar churches across Europe.\nThe round church is 55 feet (17 m) in diameter, and contains within it a circle of the earliest known surviving free-standing Purbeck Marble columns. It is probable that the walls and grotesque heads were originally painted in colours.\nIt was consecrated on 10 February 1185 by Heraclius, Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem. It is believed that King Henry II (1154â1189) was present at the consecration.\n\n\n=== 1185â1307 ===\nThe Knights Templar order was very powerful in England, with the Master of the Temple sitting in parliament as primus baro (the first baron in precedence of the realm). The compound was regularly used as a residence by kings and by legates of the Pope. The Temple also served as an early safety-deposit bank, sometimes in defiance of the Crown's attempts to seize the funds of nobles who had entrusted their wealth there. The quasi-supra-national independent network and great wealth of the order throughout Europe, and the jealousy this caused in secular kingdoms, is considered by most commentators to have been the primary cause of its eventual downfall.\nIn January 1215 William Marshal served as a negotiator during a meeting in the Temple between King John and the barons, who demanded that the king should uphold the rights enshrined in the Coronation Charter of his predecessor and elder brother King Richard I. Marshal swore on behalf of the king that the grievances of the barons would be addressed in the summer, which led to the signing by the king of Magna Carta in June.\nMarshal later became regent during the reign of John's infant son, King Henry III (1216â1272). Henry later expressed a desire to be buried in the church and, to accommodate this, in the early 13th century the chancel of the original church was pulled down and a new larger chancel was built, the basic form of which survives today. It was consecrated on Ascension Day 1240 and comprises a central aisle and two side aisles, north and south, of identical width. The height of the vault is 36 feet 3 inches (11.05 m). Although one of Henry's infant sons was buried in the chancel, Henry himself later altered his will to reflect his new wish to be buried in Westminster Abbey.\n\n\n=== Crown seizure ===\nAfter the destruction and abolition of the Knights Templar in 1307, King Edward II took control of the church as a Crown possession. It was later given to the Knights Hospitaller, who leased the Temple to two colleges of lawyers. One college moved into the part of the Temple previously used by the Knights, and the other into the part previously used by its clergy, and both shared the use of the church. The colleges evolved into the Inner Temple and the Middle Temple, two of the four London Inns of Court.\n\n\n=== 16thâ19th centuries ===\nIn 1540 the church became the property of the Crown once again when King Henry VIII abolished the Knights Hospitaller in England and confiscated their property. Henry provided a priest for the church under the former title \"Master of the Temple\". In the 1580s the church was the scene of the Battle of the Pulpits, a theological conflict between the Puritans and supporters of the Elizabethan Compromise. Shakespeare was familiar with the site and the church and garden feature in his play Henry VI, part 1 as the setting for the fictional scene of the plucking of two roses of York and Lancaster and the start of the Wars of the Roses. In 2002 this event was commemorated with the planting of new white and red roses in the modern gardens.\nFollowing an agreement in 1608 by King James I, the two Inns were granted use of the church in perpetuity on condition that they should support and maintain it. They continue to use the Temple church as their ceremonial chapel.\nThe church escaped damage in the Great Fire of London of 1666. Nevertheless, it was refurbished by Christopher Wren, who made extensive modifications to the interior, including the addition of an altar screen and the installation of the church's first organ. The church underwent a Victorian restoration in 1841 by Smirke and Burton, who decorated the walls and ceiling in high Victorian Gothic style in an attempt to return the church back to its supposed original appearance. In 1850 a fire begun in the furnace room badly damaged the chorister's room above and threatened the organ situated behind that room's wall, but was extinguished before it could spread further. Further restoration work was executed in 1862 by James Piers St Aubyn.\n\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nOn 10 May 1941, German incendiary bombs set the roof of the Round Church on fire, and the fire quickly spread to the nave and chapel. The organ and all the wooden parts of the church, including the Victorian renovations, were destroyed and the Purbeck marble columns in the chancel cracked due to the intense heat. Although these columns still provided some support to the vault, they were deemed unsound and were replaced in identical form. The original columns had a slight outward lean, which architectural quirk was followed in the replacement columns. The Master's House was burned down on the same night.\nDuring the renovation by the architect Walter Godfrey, it was discovered that elements of the 17th-century renovations made by Wren had survived in storage and these were replaced in their original positions. The church was rededicated in November 1958.\n\nThe church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.\n\n\n== Use ==\n\nAmong other purposes, the church was originally used for Templar initiation ceremonies. In England the ceremony involved new recruits entering the Temple via the western door at dawn. The initiates entered the circular nave and then took monastic vows of piety, chastity, poverty and obedience. The details of initiation ceremonies were always a closely guarded secret, which later contributed to the order's downfall as gossip and rumours spread about possible blasphemous usages. These rumours were manipulated and exploited by the order's enemies, such as King Philip IV of France, to fabricate a pretext for the order's suppression.\nToday the Temple Church holds regular church services, including Holy Communion and Mattins on Sunday morning. It also holds weddings, but only for members of the Inner and Middle Temples. The Temple Church serves both the Inner Temple and the Middle Temple as a private chapel.\nThe Temple Church has always been a royal peculiar, due to which the choristers have the privilege of wearing scarlet cassocks. Debate exists regarding the relationship of its status as Crown subject and peculiar. Relations with the Bishop of London are very good and she regularly attends events and services at the Temple Church. The Bishop of London is also ex officio Dean of the Chapel Royal.\n\n\n=== Music at the Temple Church ===\n\nThe church offers regular choral music performances and organ recitals. A choir in the English cathedral tradition was established at the Temple Church in 1842 under the direction of Dr E. J. Hopkins, and it soon earned a high reputation.\nIn 1927, the Temple Choir under George Thalben-Ball became world-famous with its recording of Mendelssohn's Hear My Prayer, including the solo \"O for the Wings of a Dove\" sung by Ernest Lough. This became one of the most popular recordings of all time by a church choir, and it sold strongly throughout the twentieth century, reaching gold disc status (a million copies) in 1962 and achieving an estimated 6 million sales to date.\nThe Temple Church's excellent acoustics have also attracted secular musicians: Sir John Barbirolli recorded a famous performance of the Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis by Ralph Vaughan Williams there in 1962 (at the suggestion of Bernard Herrmann), and Paul Tortelier made his recording of the complete Bach Cello Suites there in April 1982.\nIn 2003 the church was the location of a music video of Libera.\nWhile writing the score for Interstellar, film composer Hans Zimmer chose the Temple Church for the recording of the parts of the score that included an organ. The church's former organist, Roger Sayer, played the organ, while a large orchestra played throughout the church. Zimmer is quoted saying that \"Setting foot into Temple Church is like stepping into profound history. ...Temple Church houses one of the most magnificent organs in the world.\"\nThe choir continues to record, broadcast and perform, in addition to its regular services at the Temple Church. It is an all-male choir, consisting of 18 boys who are all educated on generous scholarships (most of the boys attend the City of London School although the scholarship is portable) and 12 professional men. They perform weekly at Sunday services, 11:15â12:15 pm, during term time. The choir gave the world premiere of Sir John Tavener's epic The Veil of the Temple, which took place over seven hours during an overnight vigil in the Temple Church in 2003. The following year it was performed by the choir at the Lincoln Festival in New York City; a concert version was performed at the BBC Proms the same year. Two new recordings were released in 2010 on the Signum Classics label: one of the Temple Church Choir, and a recording of English organ music played by James Vivian. Both were critically acclaimed. The boys' choir also appears on the 2016 recording of John Rutter's violin concerto Visions, and on an album of upper-voices Christmas music released the same year.\n\n\n==== Organ ====\n\nThe church contains two organs: a chamber organ built by Robin Jennings in 2001, and a four manual Harrison & Harrison organ, built in 1924 as a private ballroom organ at Glen Tanar House and installed at the Temple Church in 1954.\n\n\n==== List of organists ====\nThe church has had a number of famous organists, including:\n\nFrancis Pigott 1688â1704\nJohn Pigott 1704â1737 (from 1729 for Middle Temple only)\n\n(from 1814 for both Inner and Middle Temple)\n\nGeorge Price 1814â1826\nGeorge Warne 1826â1843 (afterwards organist of St Nicholas' Church, Great Yarmouth)\nDr Edward John Hopkins 1843â1897\nSir Henry Walford Davies 1897â1923\nSir George Thalben-Ball 1923â1982\nDr John Birch 1982â1997\nStephen Layton 1997â2006\nJames Vivian 2006â2013\nRoger Sayer 2014â2023\nThomas Allery 2023-\n\n\n== Master of the Temple ==\nThe church always has two clergy, called the \"Master of the Temple\" and the \"Reader of the Temple.\" The title of the Master of the Temple recalls the title of the head of the former order of the Knights Templar. The Master of the Temple is appointed by the Crown; the right of appointment was reserved when the Church was granted to the two Inns by James I in 1608. The church has the status of a peculiar rather than a private chapel and is outside any episcopal or archiepiscopal jurisdiction. The present Master of the Temple is the Reverend Robin Griffith-Jones, appointed in 1999. The Master gives regular lunchtime talks open to the public.\nThe official title of the Master of the Temple is the \"Reverend and Valiant Master of the Temple.\" His official residence is the Master's House, a Georgian townhouse built next to the church in 1764.\n\n\n=== Masters of the Temple ===\n\nâ  Master died in post\n\n\n== Buried in the church ==\n\nSir Richard Chetwode, Sheriff of Northamptonshire (1560â1635).\nSilvester de Everdon, Bishop of Carlisle and Lord Chancellor of England (died 1254).\nSir Anthony Jackson (1599â1666).\nGeoffrey de Mandeville, 1st Earl of Essex (died September 1144).\nWilliam Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke (1146â1219).\nWilliam Marshal, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (1190 â 6 April 1231).\nGilbert Marshal, 4th Earl of Pembroke (1194 â 27 June 1241).\nDr Richard Mead (1673â1754).\nWilliam Petyt, barrister, legal scholar, and Keeper of the Records in the Tower of London (1640/1641 â 3 October 1707).\nSir Edmund Plowden (1518â1585).\nFrancis James Newman Rogers (1791â1851).\nJohn Selden (1584 â 1654), English jurist\nJames Simpson (1737â1815), Attorney General of Colonial South Carolina.

    "wikipediaText": "St Bride's Church is a Church of England church in Fleet Street in the City of London. Likely dedicated to Saint Bridget perhaps as early as the 6th century, the building's most recent incarnation was designed by Sir Christopher Wren in 1672, though Wren's original building was largely gutted by fire during the London Blitz in 1940 and then was faithfully reconstructed in the 1950s.\nDue to its location in Fleet Street, it has a long association with journalists and newspapers. The church is a distinctive sight on London's skyline and is clearly visible from a number of locations. Since 2012 St Bride's celebretes usually on first or second thursday of november the \"Journalistsâ Commemorative Service\".\nWith its steeple  standing 226 feet (69m) tall, it is the second highest of all Wren's church spires, with only St Paul's itself having a higher pinnacle.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nSt Bride's may be one of the most ancient churches in London, with worship perhaps dating back to the conversion of the Middle Saxons in the 7th century. It is believed that its name is derived from Bridget of Ireland, the patron saint of Ireland. It may have been founded by Irish monks, missionaries proselytising the English. It is believed that the original church, founded around the 6th Century by Irish missionaries, is the only such celtic Irish founded church in the east of Britain.\nThe present St Bride's is at least the seventh church to have stood on the site. Traditionally, it was founded by St Bridget in the sixth century. Whether or not she founded it personally, the remnants of the first church appear to have significant similarities to a church of the same date in Kildare, Ireland. The Norman church, built in the 11th century, was of both religious and secular significance; in 1210, King John held a parliament there. It was replaced by a larger church in the 15th century,\nSt Bride's association with the newspaper business began in 1500, when Wynkyn de Worde set up a printing press next door. Until 1695, London was the only city in England where printing was permitted by law.\n\n\n=== Roanoke colony ===\nIn the late 1580s, Eleanor White, daughter to artist and explorer John White, was married in St Bride's to the tiler and bricklayer Ananias Dare. Their daughter, Virginia Dare, was to be the first English child born in North America. She was born on Roanoke Island on 18 August 1587: \"Elenora, daughter to the governour and wife to Ananias Dare, one of the assistants, was delivered of a daughter in Roanoke\". The child was healthy and \"was christened there the Sunday following, and because this childe was the first Christian borne in Virginia, she was named Virginia\". A modern bust of Virginia Dare stands near the font (one of the few survivals from the original church)  replacing an earlier monument which was stolen and has not been recovered.\n\n\n=== Great Fire of London ===\n\nIn the mid-17th century disaster struck. In 1665, the Great Plague of London killed 238 parishioners in a single week, and in 1666, the following year, the church was completely destroyed during the Great Fire of London, which burned much of the city. After the fire, the old church was replaced by an entirely new building designed by Sir Christopher Wren, one of his largest and most expensive works, taking seven years to build.\nSt Bride's was reopened on 19 December 1675. The famous spire was added later, in 1701â1703. It originally measured 234 ft, but lost its upper eight feet to a lightning strike in 1764; this was then bought by the then owner of Park Place, Berkshire, where it still resides. The design utilises four octagonal stages of diminishing height, capped with an obelisk which terminates in a ball and vane.\nBuried at St Bride's is Robert Levet (Levett), a Yorkshireman who became a Parisian waiter, then a \"practicer of physick\" who ministered to the denizens of London's seedier neighbourhoods. Having been duped into a bad marriage, the hapless Levet was taken in by the author Samuel Johnson who wrote his poem \"On the Death of Mr. Robert Levet\", eulogising his good friend and tenant of many years. Also buried at St Bride's are the composer Sir William Leighton (d. 1622), organist and composer Thomas Weelkes (d. 1623) and the poet Richard Lovelace (d. 1658), as well as author Samuel Richardson (d. 1761)\nThe wedding cake is said to date back to 1703 when Thomas Rich, a baker's apprentice from Ludgate Hill, fell in love with the daughter of his employer and asked her to marry him. He wanted to make an extravagant cake, and drew on the design of St Bride's Church for inspiration.\n\n\n=== Second World War ===\nOn the night of 29 December 1940, during the Blitz of central London in the Second World War, the church was gutted by fire-bombs dropped by the Luftwaffe. That night 1,500 fires were started, including three major conflagrations, leading to a fire storm, an event dubbed the Second Great Fire of London, due to the enormous amount of damage caused.  St Paul's Cathedral itself was only saved by the dedication of the London firemen who kept the fire away from the cathedral and the volunteer firewatchers of the St Paul's Watch who fought to keep the flames from firebombs on the roof from spreading. After the war, St Bride's was rebuilt at the expense of newspaper proprietors and journalists.\nOne fortunate and unintended consequence of the bombing was the excavation of the church's original 6th century Saxon foundations. Today, the crypt known as the Museum of Fleet Street is open to the public and contains a number of ancient relics, including Roman coins and medieval stained glass.\nPost-war excavations also uncovered nearly 230 lead coffins with plaques dating from the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries, filled with the bones of parishioners; causes of death for most of them were found by the Museum of London.\n\n\n== Modern era ==\n\nThe church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.\nIn September 2007 the former rector, Archdeacon the Venerable David Meara, announced a special appeal to raise  Â£3.5 million to preserve the church's unique heritage and in November 2007 Queen Elizabeth II was guest of honour at a service to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the restoration work necessary after the Second World War.\nIn March 2012, the Inspire! appeal was launched to raise the at least Â£2.5m needed to repair the crumbling stonework of the church's famous spire.\nIn March 2016 the wedding of Jerry Hall and Rupert Murdoch was celebrated at St Bride's.\n\n\n== Music ==\n\n\n=== Choir ===\nThe choir in its present form (12 adult singers â 4 sopranos, 2 altos, 3 tenors and 3 basses) was established in time for the re-dedication service in 1957, and has remained more or less in this format ever since. The choir sings at two services each Sunday throughout the year (reducing to 8 singers during August) and also for numerous special services. The Director of Music is Robert Jones, and the Assistant Director of Music is Matthew Morley.\n\n\n=== Organ ===\nThe organ was built by the John Compton Organ Company, and is arguably their finest work. It was ready for the rededication of the church in November 1957. It has recently been completely overhauled and cleaned by Keith Bance, who has carried out some modest tonal updating. This included remodelling the positive division, adding new mixture stops to the great and pedal divisions and the provision of a new Vox Humana for the solo division. These changes have further increased the resources of an already versatile instrument. The organ has four manuals, 98 speaking stops, close to 4,000 pipes, a multi-level capture system and the wind is provided by four blowing installations.\n\n\n==== Organists ====\nHenry Lightindollar 1696â1702\nJohn Weldon 1702â1736\nSamuel Howard 1736â1782\nRichard Huddleston Potter 1782â1821\nGeorge Mather 1821â1854\nMr. Reynolds, from 1854\nErnest Kiver, from 1882\nJohn D. Codner, until 1888 (later organist of St Davids Cathedral)\nEdmund Hart Turpin 1888â1907\nHerbert Townsend 1909âca. 1921\nGordon Reynolds 1952â1965\nRobert Langston 1972â1988\nRobert Harre-Jones, from 1988\n\n\n=== Bells ===\nSt Bride's Church is noted as the site of the first ever full peal on twelve bells (5060 Grandsire Cinques), and is considered to be one of the first towers which had a diatonic ring of twelve bells. Ten bells were cast for the church in 1710 by Abraham Rudhall of Gloucester, and were augmented to twelve in 1719 with the addition of two trebles. The 5th and 6th bells were recast by Samuel Knight of Holborn in 1736.\nAll of the bells were destroyed on 29 December 1940 during the Blitz. After the war, a single bell cast by John Taylor & Co was placed in the tower, hung for full-circle ringing, but was never joined by any other bells. During the installation, the church and foundry made sure that it was sympathetic to a future 12-bell installation. It weighs 15 hundredweight in the key of Fâ¯, and would be the 10th of a new ring of 12 in D.\n\n\n== Notable parishioners ==\n\nSt Bride's has had a number of notable parishioners, including John Milton, John Dryden, and the diarist Samuel Pepys, who was baptized in the church. Pepys buried his brother Tom in the church in 1664, but by this stage the vaults were so overcrowded that Pepys had to bribe the gravedigger to \"justle together\" the corpses in order to make room. In 2009, Sir Clement Freud's funeral was held in the church.\n\n\n== Notable burials in the churchyard ==\nRoger Giffard, physician\nRichard Lovelace, poet\nDenis Papin, steam engine pioneer\nThomas Pellett, physician\nSamuel Richardson, novelist\nThomas Weelkes, composer\nWilliam Charles Wells, physician, formulated early ideas of natural selection\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBridewell Theatre\nList of Christopher Wren churches in London\nSt Bride Library\nAnna Popplewell - British actress from The Chronicles of Narnia who portrayed Susan Pevensie: also a member of the congregation as her mother Debra Lomas was a churchwarden.\n\n\n== References ==\nDailey, Donna; Tomedi, John (2005).

    "wikipediaText": "The Guild Church of St Dunstan-in-the-West is in Fleet Street in the City of London. It is dedicated to Dunstan, Bishop of London and Archbishop of Canterbury. The church is of medieval origin, although the present building, with an octagonal nave, was constructed in the 1830s to the designs of John Shaw.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Medieval church ===\n\nIt is first mentioned in written records in 1185.  But there is no evidence of the date of its original foundation.  There is speculation that it might have been erected by Dunstan himself, or by priests who knew him well. Others suggest a foundation date of between AD 988 (death of St Dunston) and 1070.  Another speculation is that a church on this site was one of the Lundenwic strand settlement churches, like St Martin in the Fields, the first St Mary le Strand, St Clement Danes and St Bride's, which may pre-date any within the walls of the City of London.\nKing Henry III gained possession of it and its endowments from Westminster Abbey by 1237, and then granted these and the advowson to the Domus Conversorum ('House of the Converts,' i.e., of converted Jews), which led to neglect of its parochial responsibilities.\nWilliam Tyndale, the celebrated translator of the Bible, was a lecturer at the church; the poet John Donne was at one time vicar, and delivered sermons. Samuel Pepys mentions the church in his diary. The church narrowly escaped the Great Fire of London in 1666. The Dean of Westminster roused 40 scholars from Westminster School in the middle of the night, who formed a fire brigade that extinguished the flames with buckets of water; the flames reached a point three doors away.\nThe medieval church underwent many alterations before its demolition in the early 19th century. Small shops were built against its walls, St Dunstan's Churchyard becoming a centre for bookselling and publishing. Later repairs were carried out in an Italianate style: rusticated stonework was used, and some of the Gothic windows were replaced with round-headed ones, resulting in what George Godwin called \"a most heterogeneous appearance\". The church's old vaulted roof was replaced in 1701 with a flat ceiling, ornamented with recessed panels.\nThe Worshipful Company of Cordwainers has been associated with the church since the 15th century. The company holds an annual service of commemoration to honour two of its benefactors, John Fisher and Richard Minge; by tradition, following the service, children were given a penny for each time they ran around the church.\n\n\n=== Rebuilding ===\n\nIn the early 19th century the medieval church of St Dunstan was removed to allow the widening of Fleet Street, and a new church was built on its burial ground. An Act of Parliament was obtained in July 1829 which authorised the demolition of the church, and trustees were appointed to carry it into effect. Auctions of some of the materials of the old church took place in December 1829 and September 1830. The first stone of the new building, to the design of John Shaw Sr. (1776â1832), was laid in July 1831 and construction proceeded rapidly. In August 1832 the last part of the old church, which had been left as a screen between Fleet Street and the new work, was removed.\nShaw dealt with the restricted site by designing a church with an octagonal central space. Seven of the eight sides open into arched recesses, the northern one containing the altar. The eighth side opens into a short corridor, leading beneath the organ to the lowest stage of the tower, which serves as an entrance porch. Above the recesses Shaw designed a clerestory, and above that a groined ceiling. The tower is square in plan, with an octagonal lantern, resembling those of St Botolph's Church, Boston, and St Helen's, York. George Godwin suggested that the form of the lantern might have been immediately inspired by that of St George's church in Ramsgate (where Shaw was architect to the docks), built in 1825 to the designs of H. E. Kendall. John Shaw Sr. died in 1833, before the church was completed, leaving it in the hands of his son John Shaw Jr. (1803â1870).\n\nThe communion rail is a survivor of the old church, having been carved by Grinling Gibbons during the period when John Donne served as vicar (1624â1631). Some of the monuments from the medieval building were reinstituted in the new church, and a fragment of the old churchyard remains between Clifford's Inn and Bream's Buildings.\n\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nApart from losing its stained glass, the church survived the London Blitz largely intact, though bombs did damage the open-work lantern tower. The church was damaged again on 24/25 March 1944, during Operation Steinbock, a lower-intensity attack on London late in the war. The building was largely restored in 1950. An appeal to raise money to install a new ring of bells in the tower, replacing those removed in 1969, was successfully completed in 2012 with the dedication and hanging of 10 new bells.\nThe church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.\n\n\n== Clock ==\n\nOn the faÃ§ade is a chiming clock, with figures of giants, perhaps representing Gog and Magog, who strike the bells with their clubs. It was installed on the previous church in 1671, perhaps commissioned to celebrate its escape from destruction by the Great Fire of 1666. It was the first public clock in London to have a minute hand. The figures of the two giants strike the hours and quarters, and turn their heads. There are numerous literary references to the clock, including in Thomas Hughes' Tom Brown's Schooldays, Oliver Goldsmith's The Vicar of Wakefield; Nicholas Nickleby, Master Humphrey's Clock and Barnaby Rudge by Charles Dickens, The Warden by Anthony Trollope, the penny dreadful serial The String of Pearls (in which the character Sweeney Todd first appears), David Lyddal's \"The Prompter\" (1810), and a poem by William Cowper.\nIn 1828, when the medieval church was demolished, the clock was removed by art collector Francis Seymour-Conway, 3rd Marquess of Hertford, to Winfield House, his mansion in Regent's Park, which became known as St Dunstan's. During the First World War, Winfield House was lent as a hostel for blinded soldiers, and the new charity took the name St Dunstan's (now Blind Veterans UK).\nThe clock was returned by Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere (the brother of Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe) in 1935 to mark the Silver Jubilee of King George V.\n\n\n== Statues and monuments ==\n\nAbove the entrance to the old parochial school is a statue of Queen Elizabeth I, taken from the old Ludgate, which was demolished in 1760. This statue, by William Kerwin and dating from 1586, is contemporaneous with its subject and thought to be the oldest outdoor statue in London. The playwright Gwen John and her sister Winifred Jones worked alongside the suffragettes Millicent and Agnes Fawcett to pay for it to be repaired. In the porch below are three statues of ancient Britons also from the gate, probably meant to represent King Lud and his two sons.\nAdjacent to Queen Elizabeth is a memorial to Lord Northcliffe, the newspaper proprietor, co-founder of the Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror. (Fleet Street was known as the street of newspapers.) Unveiled in 1930, the obelisk was designed by Edwin Lutyens and the bronze bust is by Kathleen Scott. Next to Lord Northcliffe is a memorial tablet to James Louis Garvin, another pioneering British journalist.\nClose to the font, there is a bronze memorial plaque for Thomas Mudge (1715/16â1794), inventor of the lever escapement and watchmaker to George III. The tablet was made and engraved by noted sundial maker, hand-engraver and sculptor Joanna Midgal. It was commissioned by the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers, and installed in March 2019.\nBehind the iconostasis  (wall of icons) to the left side of the church, high on a wall, there is a marble memorial tablet to the highly regarded seventeenth-century clockmaker Henry Jones (1634â1695), who worked in the Inner Temple, and his wife Hannah, who continued their business after his death. Jones was an apprentice of Edward East.\n\n\n== Romanian Orthodox chapel ==\nSt Dunstan-in-the-West is one of the churches in England to share its building with the Romanian Orthodox community (St. George church). The chapel to the left of the main altar is closed off by an iconostasis, formerly from Antim Monastery in Bucharest, dedicated in 1966.\n\n\n== Noted associations ==\nThe church has associations with many notable people:\n\nRichard Lyst, rector of the church and supporter of Anne Boleyn\nDr Thomas Campion or Campian (1567-1620), physician, one of the most charming poets of the Elizabethan age and delicate writer of lute songs\nPhilip Rosseter (1568-1623), fellow composer and intimate friend of Campian, both buried here\nLord Baltimore, who founded Maryland, was buried here in 1632, as was his son.\nMatthew Bryan, Jacobite preacher, was buried here in 1699.\nCelebrated London clockmaker and watchmaker Charles Gretton was a warden of the church and was buried there in 1731.\nThe diarist Samuel Pepys was a regular worshipper.\nEdward Latymer was a worshipper, and upon his death, in 1627, was buried in the south aisle.\nJohn Calvert, Master of the Worshipful Company of Turners, a prominent ivory carver of the early 19th century.\nThe poet John Donne held the benefice here from 1624 to 1631 while he was Dean of St Paul's.\nWilliam Tyndale, who pioneered the translation of the Bible into English, was a lecturer.\nIzaak Walton was a sidesman here.\nThomas Mudge, the eminent watchmaker, was buried here in 1794.\nThe church has often been associated with the legend of Sweeney Todd, the 'demon-barber' of Fleet Street. This is most likely due to it being mentioned in the original penny dreadful The String of Pearls as the church bearing a crypt into which the remnants of Sweeney Todd's victims were unceremoniously dumped after they had been murdered and turned into meat pies.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nSt Dunstan-in-the-West appeared as the \"journalists' church\" in the 2018 TV series Press. The real journalists' church is St Bride's.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of churches and cathedrals of London\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nSt Dunstan in the West website\nChurch Bells of the City of London â St Dunstan in the West"

    "wikipediaText": "Saint Vedast Foster Lane or Saint Vedast-alias-Foster, a church in Foster Lane, in the City of London, is dedicated to St. Vedast (Foster is an Anglicisation of the name \"Vaast\", as the saint is known in continental Europe), a French saint whose cult arrived in England through contacts with Augustinian clergy.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe original church of St Vedast was founded before 1308 and was extensively repaired by 1662 on parochial initiative. The poet Robert Herrick was baptised here in 1591.\nAlthough the church was not completely destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666, it was so badly damaged that it was included in the list of 50 or so churches that required reconstruction by the office of Sir Christopher Wren. The main part of the church was rebuilt 1670â1673 on the old walls at a cost of Â£1,853, 15s and 6d, the cheapest of all Wren's City commissions. Some parts of the medieval fabric were incorporated, most noticeably the south wall which was revealed by restoration in 1992â93.\nThe tower, on the other hand, survived in its original state until 1694 when it was pulled down, and a new one erected (possibly on its mediaeval lower stages) in 1695â98. The three-tier spire, considered one of the most baroque of all the City spires, was added in 1709â12 at a cost of Â£2,958, possibly to the designs of Nicholas Hawksmoor, whose correspondence with the churchwardens also survives, but whose drawings do not. With this late completion date, it was possibly the last of Wren's city churches to be finished. The tower was built by Edward Strong the Younger, a friend of Christopher Wren the Younger.\n\n Wren's church was gutted a second time by firebombs during the London blitz() of 1940 and 1941. A proposal by Sir Hugh Casson to leave this and several other churches as roofless ruins to serve as a war memorial was not implemented. The post-war restoration within the old walls and re-roofing was undertaken by Stephen Dykes Bower from 1953 under the new rector, Canon Charles B. Mortlock. The Parochial Church Council at the time included Sir John Betjeman and the organ builder Noel Mander.\nDykes Bower re-ordered the interior in a collegiate chapel style with seating down each side with a side chapel in the former South aisle, and squared the old walls which were not rectangular in plan so that the altar now faces the nave squarely. He made an almost imperceptible taper in the pews and floor pattern, to give a false perspective towards the altar, making the church look longer than it is. Dykes Bower designed the fine plaster ceiling, in the style of the late seventeenth century, which is embellished with gold and varnished aluminium leaf. Fittings from other destroyed City churches, including the richly carved pulpit from All Hallows Bread Street and the font and cover from St Anne and St Agnes were incorporated into the new design.  Dykes Bower commissioned the Whitefriars glass windows in the East End, showing scenes from the life of St Vedast. These windows use opaque glass to hide tall buildings behind and to disguise the fact that the East wall is a wedge in plan. The work was completed in 1962.  An aumbry above the south chapel altar is by Bernard Merry.\n\nDykes Bower also built a small Parish Room to the North East of the church in 17th-century style and a Georgian-style rectory, adjacent to the church, on Foster Lane in 1959 â in the first floor room of which is an important mural by Hans Feibusch on the subject of Jacob and the Angel. A niche in the internal courtyard of the rectory contains a carved stone head of Canon Mortlock by sculptor Jacob Epstein. Mortlock gave the eulogy at Epstein's funeral in 1959.\nThe church is noted for its small but lively baroque steeple, its small secluded courtyard, stained glass, and a richly decorated ceiling. It also has a ring of six bells, cast by Mears and Stainbank in 1960. They were recast from the mixed peal (of which the earliest dated back to 1671) which were all cracked in the bombing of 1941.\n\n\n== Organ ==\nThe current organ was originally built by John Harris (the son of Renatus Harris) & John Byfield in 1731 for St Bartholomew-by-the-Exchange. That church was demolished in 1840, and its newly built replacement, St. Bartholomew, Moor Lane housed the organ from 1841. The church was in turn demolished in 1902; the organ found its way to St. Alban-the-Martyr, Fulham, (built 1894â6) in 1904; and lastly to St. Vedast in 1959. It was restored and enlarged in 1962 by Noel Mander, re-using the Harris case. It has one of the oldest soundboards still in use in the country.\nThe previous organ was by J.W. Walker, installed at the West end of the church in 1853. It was enlarged by J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd and moved to the East end in 1885. It was destroyed during the incendiary bombing on 10 May 1941. It replaced one built by Crang & Hancock in 1774.\n\n\n== Listed building status ==\nThe church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950. The rectory was listed as a Grade II building on 15 July 1998.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of churches and cathedrals of London\nList of Christopher Wren churches in London\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nSt Vedast-alias-Foster from Friends of the City Churches\n360Â° panorama inside St Vedast-alias-Foster"

    "wikipediaText": "St James Garlickhythe is a Church of England parish church in Vintry ward of the City of London, nicknamed \"Wren's lantern\" owing to its profusion of windows.\nRecorded since the 12th century, the church was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666 and rebuilt by the office of Sir Christopher Wren. It is also the official church of several City livery companies.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe church is dedicated to the disciple St James known as 'the Great'. St. James Garlickhythe is a stop on a pilgrims' route ending at the cathedral of Santiago da Compostela. Visitors to the London church may have their credencial, or pilgrim passport, stamped with the impression of a scallop shell.\n\n'Garlickhythe' refers to the nearby landing place, or \"hythe\", near which garlic was sold in medieval times.\nThe earliest surviving reference to the church is as ecclesiam Sancti Jacobi in a 12th-century will. Other records of the church refer to it as St James in the Vintry, St James Comyns, St James-by-the-Thames and St James super Ripam.\nThe ships from France loaded with garlic also carried wine and St James has a long association with wine merchants. The church is located in the city ward of Vintry, and in 1326 the Sheriff of London and vintner Richard de Rothing paid to have the church rebuilt. Another company with long associations with the church is the Joiners' Company, who trace their origins back to a religious guild founded in St James in 1375.\nIn the following century, the church became collegiate and was served by seven chantry priests. The eminence of St. James in the Middle Ages is reflected in its being the burial place of six Lord Mayors.\nSt. James became a parish church upon the dissolution of the monasteries under Henry VIII, although the church was not adversely affected â indeed it was a beneficiary of the demolition of church furnishings associated with the Roman Catholic rite. In 1560, the rood screen of the nearby St. Martin Vintry was dismantled and fashioned into pews for St. James. At the same time, the choir was provided with song books.\nAnother change introduced under Henry VIII was the order that all parishes in England were to maintain a weekly register of births, deaths and marriages. The oldest surviving registers are those of St. James, the first entry being the baptism of Edward Butler on 18 November 1535.\nSt. James was repaired and expanded several times during the first half of the 17th century â the north aisle being rebuilt in 1624 and a gallery added in 1644.\nUnder the Commonwealth, the parishioners provided a pension for the rector after he was ousted, in 1647, for using the banned Book of Common Prayer.\nAll was lost in the Great Fire. Rebuilding began a decade later, as recorded on the Victorian vestry boards prominent in the church porch;\n\"The foundation thereof were laid AD 1676 â John Hinde and John Hoyle, Church Wardens. It was rebuilt and re-opened 1682 and completely finished AD 1683â¦\". The body of the church may have been finished, but the tower lacked a steeple.\nRecorded in the churchâs accounts for 1682 are the items\n\nTwo bottles of sherry and pipes [wine containers] at the opening of the church        3.4\nHire of 3 dozen cushions and porterage                           13.4\nWine when the Lord Mayor and Aldermen were at our church                 1.11.0\nWax links to enlighten my Lord Mayor home                          4.6\nand a payment of 40s each to Wren's two clerks \"for their care and kindness in hastening the building of the church, and to induce them to do the like for the more speedy finishing of the Steeple.\"\nThis inducement had no effect. Building on the tower began 33 years later and was finished in 1717 by Nicholas Hawksmoor. The tower was built by Edward Strong the Younger a friend of Christopher Wren the Younger.\nThe total cost of the church and tower was Â£7230.\n\nOn 12 August 1711 Richard Steele attended a Sunday service led by the Rector Philip Stubbs at St. James, and published the ensuing reflections in Issue 147 of The Spectator. He compares the moving delivery of the rector with a number of stereotypes â the quiet talker, the negligent reader, the fast talker and the bombast, then goes on to criticise the ranting of Presbyterians and Dissenters. Unfortunately, his account includes no description of the congregation or of the church itself.\nOne month after this sermon, the future composer and Master of the Kingâs Musick, William Boyce, was baptised in St. James Garlickhythe.\nThe second half of the 19th century saw a movement of population from the City of London to suburbs in Middlesex, Kent, Essex and Surrey. This left many of the city churches with tiny congregations. In 1860, Charles Dickens attended a Sunday service at St. James Garlickhythe which he describes in The Uncommercial Traveller. The congregation had dwindled to twenty, the building was pervaded with damp and dust, which Dickens uses to convey an impression of the presence of dead parishioners.\nThe Union of Benefices Act 1860 was passed by Parliament, permitting the demolition of City churches and the sale of land to build churches in the suburbs. While several nearby churches â some of architectural eminence â were destroyed under the Union of Benefices Act, St. James was spared, perhaps due to its links to the guilds.\nDuring World War I, a bomb dropped by a Zeppelin missed the church. In thanksgiving, the church introduced an annual Bomb Sermon.\nIn May 1941, during the London Blitz a 500 lb German high explosive bomb crashed through the roof of St. James and buried itself below the floor in the south aisle. It did not explode, but was removed to Hackney Marshes and detonated. The buildings surrounding St. James were destroyed by incendiary bombs and this caused much external damage to the church, including the destruction of its clock. While this damage was being repaired in 1953, it was found that the woodwork was infested with the death watch beetle. This caused the church to be closed until 1963, while it was being restored by D. Lockhart-Smith and Alexander Gale. The result was said by Sir John Betjeman to be the best restoration of a City church.\nIn 1991, during construction of Vintners Hall across Upper Thames Street, a crane collapsed and the jib buried itself in the south wall. This caused the church to be closed again while the south face was rebuilt and some of the furnishings replaced.\n\n\n=== Present day ===\nThe official dedication is The Parish Church of St James Garlickhythe with St Michael Queenhythe and Holy Trinity the Less.\nThe parish stretches from Gardners Lane in the west to Angel Passage in the east. Its southern border is the River Thames, and to the north it snakes through the lanes south of Cannon Street.\nThe area now covers seven pre-Fire parishes: St James Garlickhythe, St Michael Queenhythe, Holy Trinity the Less, St Michael Paternoster Royal, St Martin Vintry, All Hallows the Great, and All Hallows the Less.\nIt is also responsible for services at the nearby St Michael Paternoster Royal, which lies within the parish boundary.\nSunday and daily services are drawn from the 1662 Book of Common Prayer. It is the church for more than a dozen livery companies (Clockmakers, Coachmakers, Dyers, Educators, Fanmakers, Glass Sellers, Gold and Silver Wyre Drawers, Horners, Joiners and Ceilers, Needlemakers, Painter-Stainers, Parish Clerks, Skinners, Vintners, and Weavers), as well as being the church of the Intelligence Corps.\nThe parish has passed resolutions A and B of the Priests (Ordination of Women) Measure 1993; this means that female priests and bishops are not permitted to officiate in the church. It receives alternative episcopal oversight from the Bishop of Fulham (currently Jonathan Baker).\n\n\n== Building ==\n\nSt James Garlickhythe is in the shape of a rectangle, with the tower adjacent to the West and a protruding chancel (uniquely for a Wren church) projecting from the East. It is built from brick and Kentish ragstone, partly stuccoed, partly faced (since World War II) with Portland stone. Entrance is through a pedimented doorway with a cherub keystone in the tower, which is flanked by pairs of round headed windows in the west wall. Above is a recessed clerestory wall joined to the tower by semi-rounded pediments.\nThe south front, facing Upper Thames Street, was formerly built against, and it has only become the main faÃ§ade since 1971. It is five bays long, with blind round headed windows, the one in the centre being much larger. Above the four outer windows are round clerestory windows. These additions were only made in 1981. The north front is similar, although the windows are real.\nThe 125 foot tower was originally stuccoed. The plaster was removed in 1897 and old photographs of the church show the undressed wall. It was faced with Portland stone after World War II. The clock on the West face, with the image of St James, is a 1988 replica of a 1682 original. The figure of St James originally stood between two urns. The tower is plain, with round headed belfry windows, until the spire. At the top is a parapet with stirrup shaped piercings and squat urns on the corners. The stone spire was designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor and is similar to those of St Stephen Walbrook, St. Michael Paternoster Royal and, to a lesser extent, the west towers of St. Paulâs Cathedral. It has three levels. The lowest is square, with a contraption of two columns standing in front of two pilasters protruding from each corner on top of which is an entablature and tiny urns. This is linked to the next stage by corner volutes, with a smaller square stage with more urns, and at the top is a tiny concave stage. The whole is capped with a flag finial.\nSacheverell Sitwell stated the spire suggested the grinding out of bell music by turning, as in a hurdy-gurdy. The vine leaf and grape motif gates to the west were a gift from the Vintners' Company.\nThe church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.\n\n\n== Interior ==\nThe church interior is, at 40 feet, the highest of any Wren church. As it was originally surrounded by other buildings, Wren created tall main windows, as well as clerestory windows. The largest window of all was in the East, filling the arched alcove. Early in the 19th century, this was found to be weakening the wall and so was filled in. In 1815, the painting of the Ascension by Andrew Geddes was installed above the reredos in the place previously occupied by the window.\nWhen built, the main entrance was in the middle of the north wall. This, too, has now been filled in. The church has a nave and two narrow aisles and is of five bays. There are two rows of five Ionic columns and two semi-columns, running from West to East. The columns support an entablature, which is broken in the middle and turned to the outside walls, effectively forming transepts. The columns are evenly spaced, except for those in the middle. With the original round-headed windows in the centre (now replaced by round windows), this would have given St. James a strong northâsouth axis. The cross-axial design was a conceit also used by Wren in St Magnus the Martyr and St Martin Ludgate. Subsequent rearrangement has made this less apparent.\nThe church was much renovated by the Victorians, most significantly by Basil Champneys in 1866. Their legacy, including stained glass windows, has been removed in the post-World War II renovation.\nThe chancel to the east is flanked by pilasters, and is slightly narrower than the nave, the ratio of the width being 1/3 chancel and 1/6 each for the aisles. Unlike the rest of the church, which has a flat ceiling, it has a barrel vault.\nTo the west is a gallery, erected in 1714 and supported by iron columns. It supports the original organ case of 1719 by Father Smith, decorated with trumpeting cherubs and palm trees. It is surmounted by a scallop shell.\nThe crystal chandelier, a gift from the Glass Sellers' Company, is a replica of that destroyed by the crashing crane in 1991 and is based on an 18th-century original hanging in Wren's Emmanuel College, Cambridge.\nThe reredos is original, with Corinthian columns flanking a Decalogue and supporting an entablature. The pediment was removed in 1815 to accommodate the painting. Also original are the communion table, with doves carved on the legs, the communion rail, and the churchwardens' pews with iron hat stands. The font was made by the church's mason, Christopher Kempster, and has an ogee cover. The joiners for the original furnishings were Fuller and Cleer, and the carver William Newman.\nIn 1876, the parish was combined with that of St Michael Queenhithe â a nearby Wren church, and St James received much of the furnishings. From St Michael's are the pulpit, with a tester and twisted balusters, as well as a wig peg for the preacher. A royal coat of arms of the House of Stuart on the south wall and a sword rest also come from St Michael's, as do two grand doorways, now used as screens. In addition, the church's own royal arms (which is of the House of Hanover) is on display on the north wall, almost opposite the other royal arms â making St James Garlickhythe the only City church with two reliefs of the royal arms.\nNo longer on display is a well-preserved mummy of a man known as \"Jimmy Garlick\". His embalmed body was discovered in the vaults in 1855. Analysis by the British Museum at one time had postulated that he was an adolescent who died at the turn of the 18th century. The body used to be on display in a glass cabinet, but has been closed to public view. In 2004, Jimmy Garlick featured in the Discovery Channel documentary series Mummy Autopsy, which used modern analytical techniques including carbon dating and x-ray analysis, establishing that he died between 1641 and 1801 and that he suffered from osteoarthritis, a disease that afflicts older people. Physical examination by the Discovery team showed that the mummy appeared to be balding and suffered tooth decay at the time of death, both consistent with an older person. The body is now interred in a sarcophagus in the only remaining part of the church crypt, and so is no longer open for public viewing.\n\n\n== Bells ==\n\nA new ring of eight bells, which were granted the title \"The Royal Jubilee Bells\", was cast by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry on 3 June 2012. They were temporarily installed on a barge and rung on the River Thames during the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant, part of the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II, and have since been installed permanently in the tower of the church.\n\n\n== Burials ==\nGeorge Stanley, 9th Baron Strange\nRichard Platt, brewer and alderman, 1600\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of churches and cathedrals of London\nList of Christopher Wren churches in London\n\n\n== References ==\n\nJeffery, Paul.

    "wikipediaText": "All Hallows-by-the-Tower, at one time dedicated jointly to All Hallows (All Saints) and the Virgin Mary and sometimes known as All Hallows Barking, is an Early Medieval Anglican church on Byward Street in the City of London, England, overlooking the Tower of London.\nAccording to the church website and other sources it is \"the oldest church in the City of London\" and was founded in AD 675, although recent research has questioned these claims. The church survived the Great Fire of London in 1666, but was badly damaged during the Blitz in World War II. Following extensive reconstruction, it was rededicated in 1957. From 1922 until 1962 the vicar was Tubby Clayton, and the church is still the guild church of Toc H, the international Christian organisation that he founded.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe origin and early history of All Hallows-by-the-Tower church are obscure. At the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539 the church belonged to Barking Abbey, a wealthy Benedictine nunnery in Barking, Essex, originally established in the 7th century. The association with Barking was a long one, and All Hallows church was already known as \"Berkyncherche\" in the 12th century. According to Domesday Book in 1086, Barking Abbey possessed \"28 houses and half a church\" in London: although the church is not named, it is usually identified with All Hallows.\n\nThe original Anglo-Saxon abbey of Barking was founded by Earconwald or Erkenwald, along with Chertsey Abbey, before he became Bishop of London in 675, and it has been claimed that the land on which All Hallows stands was granted to the abbey, under Abbess Ãthelburh (Ethelburga), Erkenwald's sister, at that time. A charter dated to 687, listing properties belonging to Barking Abbey, includes two pieces of land in or near London. One of these was simply described as \"iuxta Lundoniam\", near/next to London, the other as \"supra vicum Lundoniae\", that is, in \"Lundenwic\", the Anglo-Saxon town that had grown up in the area of the Strand, a mile to the west of the old Roman city of Londinium; neither of these, though, accurately describes the location of All Hallows church, inside the wall of the Roman city on the eastern side.\nIn 1940, during World War II, the clearance after destruction caused by bombing revealed an archway built of reused Roman tiles and stonework, set in a surviving wall of the medieval church. The reuse of Roman building materials, and comparison with arches in the early Anglo-Saxon church at Brixworth, Northamptonshire, suggested that the All Hallows arch was very early in date, and that an original church could have been built as early as the 7th century. This seemed to confirm the belief that the church had been founded as a daughter church of Barking Abbey at about the same time as the abbey itself was established, although it is doubtful that the first construction on the site would have been in stone. It is more likely that the stone church, of which the arch is a remnant, superseded an earlier wooden building. Recent research, and archaeological evidence that Roman tiles and stone were being used in the construction of other London churches as late as the 11th century, suggest that the arch could have been constructed at any time between the 7th century and the arrival of the Normans. Fragments of three 11th-century stone crosses also found during archeological work in the 1930s and clearance works after the bombing, now displayed in the crypt, also date from this first church.\nThe church was expanded and rebuilt several times between the 11th and 15th centuries, with various elements of the Norman, 13th-century and 15th-century constructions still visible today. Its proximity to the Tower of London meant that it acquired royal connections, with Edward IV making one of its chapels a royal chantry and the beheaded victims of Tower executions being sent for temporary burial at All Hallows, Sir Thomas More being one of the most eminent of these.\nThe church was badly damaged by an explosion in 1650 caused when some barrels of gunpowder being stored in a warehouse adjacent to the church exploded; its west tower and some 50 nearby houses were destroyed, and there were many fatalities. The tower was rebuilt in 1658. It only narrowly survived the Great Fire of London in 1666 and owes its survival to Admiral William Penn, father of William Penn of Pennsylvania fame, who had his men from a nearby naval yard blow up the surrounding buildings to create firebreaks. During the Great Fire, Samuel Pepys climbed the church's tower to watch the progress of the blaze and what he described as \"the saddest sight of desolation\".\nRestored once more in the late 19th century, All Hallows was gutted by German bombers during the Blitz in World War II and required extensive reconstruction, and was rededicated in 1957. The church now included carving by the Tasmanian born wood carver Ellen Nora Payne.\nMany portions of the old church survived the War and have been sympathetically restored. Its outer walls are 15th-century, with the Anglo-Saxon arch doorway surviving from the original church. Many brasses remain in the interior. (The brass rubbing centre which used to be located at All Hallows is now closed). Three outstanding wooden statues of saints dating from the 15th and 16th centuries can also be found in the church, as too an exquisite Baptismal font cover which was carved in 1682 by Grinling Gibbons for Â£12, and which is regarded as one of the finest pieces of carving in London. The main-altar's reredos mural is a post-war work by Brian Thomas.\nIn 1999 the AOC Archaeology Group excavated the cemetery and made many significant discoveries.\nThe church has a museum in its crypt, containing portions of a Roman pavement which together with many artefacts was discovered many feet below the church in 1926/27. The exhibits focus on the history of the church and the City of London, and include Anglo-Saxon and religious artefacts as well as the 17th-century church plate. Also on display are the church's registers dating back to the 16th century, and notable entries include the baptism of William Penn, the marriage of John Quincy Adams, and the burial of Archbishop William Laud. Laud remained buried in a vault in the chapel for over 20 years; his body was moved during the Restoration to St John's College, Oxford. The crypt also houses the church's chapels dedicated to St Francis (14th century) and St Clare (early 17th century) as well as the columbarium, created in 1933.\nThe altar in the crypt is of plain stone from the castle of Richard I at Athlit in The Holy Land.\nAll Hallows-by-the-Tower has been the guild church of Toc H since 1922. The church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.\nThe church also has a chime which was brought back to working order in the 1970s by Philip Blewett, then a priest at the church, and Desmond Buckley over many weekends.\nThe Knollys Rose Ceremony, held annually in June, starts at the church and processes to the Mansion House, where a single rose is presented to the Lord Mayor as a 'quit rent'. The parish's annual beating the bounds ceremony also includes a boat trip to the middle of the Thames to 'beat' the water that forms the southern boundary.\n\n\n== Notable people associated with the church ==\nJohn Quincy Adams, sixth president of the United States: (married to Louisa Catherine Johnson in 1797)\nLancelot Andrewes: baptised 1555\nPhilip Clayton, also known as 'Tubby', former vicar and founder of Toc H\nCecil Jackson-Cole, founder of Help the Aged, Action Aid, co-founder of Oxfam and supporter of Toc H\nJohn Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, beheaded at the Tower 22 June 1535: (buried)\nJudge Jeffreys, notorious \"hanging judge\": (married 1667)\nWilliam Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury: beheaded at the Tower, (buried 1645)\nThomas More, beheaded at the Tower for refusing to sign Henry VIII's Act of Supremacy: (buried 1535)\nWilliam Penn, founder of Pennsylvania: (baptised 1644)\nAlbert Schweitzer, made organ recordings at All Hallows\nCecil Thomas, a sculptor who provided several funerary figures between the Wars\n\n\n== Vicars ==\n\n\n== Organ ==\n\nThe earliest records of an organ in All Hallows is one by Anthony Duddyngton dating from 1521. This was presumably lost during the English Civil War.\nAn organ was installed in 1675 by Thomas and Renatus Harris. In 1720 a new case was built by Gerard Smith. The organ was restored and improved by George Pike England in 1813, Bunting in 1872 and 1878, and Gray and Davison in 1902. There was further work by Harrison and Harrison in 1909 and 1928.

    "wikipediaText": "St Lawrence Jewry next Guildhall is a Church of England guild church in the City of London on Gresham Street, next to the Guildhall. It was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666, and rebuilt to the designs of Sir Christopher Wren. It is the official church of the Lord Mayor of London.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Medieval era ===\nThe church was originally built in the twelfth century and dedicated to St Lawrence; the weathervane of the present church is in the form of his instrument of martyrdom, the gridiron. The church is near the former medieval Jewish ghetto, which was centred on the street named Old Jewry. From 1280 it was an advowson held by Balliol College, Oxford.\nIt is thought that the unusual alignment of the church may be because it was built on the site of the London Roman Amphitheatre, which was rediscovered as recently as 1988. Its remains can now be visited beneath the Guildhall Art Gallery.\nSir Thomas More preached in the old church on this site.\n\n\n=== 17th century ===\nIn 1618 the church was repaired, and all the windows filled with stained glass paid for by individual donors.\nThe medieval church was destroyed in the Great Fire of London and built anew by Christopher Wren between 1670 and 1677. The parish was united with that of St Mary Magdalen, Milk Street, which was not rebuilt. The church is entirely faced in stone, with a grand east front, on which four attached Corinthian columns, raised on a basement, support a pediment placed against a high attic. George Godwin, writing in 1839, described the details of this facade as displaying \" a purity of feeling almost Grecian\", while pointing out that Wren's pediment acts only as a superficial adornment to the wall, rather than, as in Classical architecture, forming an extension of the roof.\nInside, Wren's church has an aisle on the north side only, divided from the nave by Corinthian columns, carrying an entablature that continues around the walls of the main body of the church, where it is supported on pilasters. The ceiling is divided into sunken panels, ornamented with wreaths and branches. The church is 81 feet long and 68 feet wide.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nThe church suffered extensive damage during the Blitz on 29 December 1940, and after the war the City of London Corporation agreed to restore it as Balliol College had no funds to do so. It was restored in 1957 by the architect Cecil Brown to Wren's original design. It is now a guild church which does not have its own parish and is not responsible to the parish authorities in its locality; it does not have to hold Sunday services.\nThe church was described by Sir John Betjeman as \"very municipal, very splendid.\" It was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.\nIt has a ring of eight bells, hung for change ringing, and cast in 1957 by Whitechapel Bell Foundry \nThe church was the burial place of John Tillotson, the Archbishop of Canterbury from 1691 to 1694; and of merchant Francis Levett, as well as the site of the wedding of his niece Ann Levett, daughter of William Levett, Dean of Bristol and former Principal of Magdalen Hall, Oxford.\nThe church is used by the New Zealand Society UK, who celebrate Waitangi Day here in February each year.\nCatherine Ennis was the organist here until her death on 24 December 2020.\n\n\n== Vicars (incomplete list) ==\n1424 Richard Collyng \n1566â1570 William Palmer\n1578â81 Samuel Perkins\n1650â1656 Richard Vines was minister\n1657â1659 Edward Reynolds\n1661â1662 Seth Ward\n1662â1668 John Wilkins\n1668â1683 Benjamin Whichcote\n1686â1721 John Mapletoft\n1857â1872 Benjamin Cowie\n1898â1920 James Stephen Barrass\n2007â2021 David Parrott\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nSt Lawrence and Mary Magdalene Drinking Fountain\nList of churches and cathedrals of London\nList of Christopher Wren churches in London\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nSt Lawrence Jewry at London City Churches website"

    "wikipediaText": "Guildhall is a municipal building in the Moorgate area of the City of London, England. It is off Gresham and Basinghall streets, in the wards of Bassishaw and Cheap. The current building dates from the 15th century; however documentary evidence suggests that a guildhall had existed at the site since at least the early 12th century. The building has been used as a town hall for several hundred years, and is still the ceremonial and administrative centre of the City of London and its Corporation. It should not be confused with London's City Hall, the administrative centre for Greater London. The term \"Guildhall\" refers both to the whole building and to its main room, which is a medieval great hall. It is a Grade I-listed building.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman, Anglo-Saxon and Medieval ===\n\nDuring the Roman period, the Guildhall was the site of the London Roman Amphitheatre, rediscovered as recently as 1988. It was the largest in Roman Britain, partial remains of which are on public display in the basement of the Guildhall Art Gallery, and the outline of whose arena is marked with a black circle on the paving of the courtyard in front of the hall. The siting of the Anglo-Saxon Guildhall here was probably due to the amphitheatre's remains. Excavations by Museum of London Archaeology at the entrance to Guildhall Yard exposed remains of the great 13th-century gatehouse built directly over the southern entrance to the Roman amphitheatre, which raises the possibility that enough of the Roman structure survived to influence the siting not only of the gatehouse and Guildhall itself but also of the church of St Lawrence Jewry whose strange alignment may shadow the elliptical form of the amphitheatre beneath.\nThe first documentary reference to a London Guildhall is dated 1127 or 1128; archaeologists have also discovered foundations dating to around that time. Legend describes the Guildhall site as being the location of the palace of Brutus of Troy, who according to Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae (1136) is said to have founded a city on the banks of the River Thames, known as Troia Nova, or New Troy.\nThe great hall is believed to be on a site of an earlier guildhall (one possible derivation for the word \"guildhall\" is the Anglo-Saxon \"gild\", meaning payment, with a \"gild-hall\" being where citizens would pay their taxes). Possible evidence for this derivation may be in a reference to John Parker, the sergeant of \"Camera Guyhalde\", London, in 1396.\n\n\n=== Current building ===\n\nConstruction began on the current building in 1411 and was completed in 1440 under the supervision of John Croxton.\n\nThe Great Hall did not completely escape damage in the Great Fire of London in 1666; it was partially restored (with a flat roof) in 1670. The present grand entrance (the east wing of the south front), in \"Hindoostani Gothic\", was added in 1788 by George Dance. A more extensive restoration than that in 1670 was completed in 1866 by the City of London architect Sir Horace Jones, who added a new timber roof in close keeping with the original hammerbeam ceiling. This replacement was destroyed during the Second Great Fire of London on the night of 29/30 December 1940, the result of a Luftwaffe fire-raid. It was replaced in 1954 during works designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, though the original hammerbeam design was not retained. The large, seated sculpture of Winston Churchill by Oscar Nemon, which was cast by H. H. Martyn & Co., was unveiled by Churchill in 1955.\nTrials at the Guildhall have included those of Anne Askew (the Protestant martyr), Thomas Cranmer (Archbishop of Canterbury) and Lady Jane Grey (\"the Nine Days' Queen\") as well as Henry Garnet (executed for his complicity in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605).\nThe 1783 hearing of the infamous Zong case, the outcome of which focused public outrage about the transatlantic slave trade, also took place at Guildhall. On 16 November 1848, the pianist FrÃ©dÃ©ric Chopin made his last public appearance on a concert platform there. The marathon route of the 2012 Summer Olympics passed through Guildhall Yard.\n\n\n== Present use ==\n\nGuildhall continues to serve as the headquarters for the City of London Corporation, with most of its offices housed in modern extensions to the north and west of the original building. The North Wing was designed by Giles Gilbert Scott and was built between 1955 and 1958, facing a new public square between Aldermanbury and Basinghall Street.\n\nThe West Wing was designed by Richard Gilbert Scott and built between 1970 and 1975 to a modernist style. The West Wing is separately listed as a Grade II listed building. The older part of Guildhall and the adjacent historic interiors are still used for official functions, and it is open to the public during the annual London Open House weekend. Guildhall Art Gallery was added to the complex in the 1990s. Guildhall Library, a public reference library with specialist collections on London, which include material from the 11th century onwards, is also housed in the complex.\n\n\n== Gog and Magog ==\n\nTwo giants, Gog and Magog, are associated with Guildhall. Legend has it that the two giants were defeated by Brutus and chained to the gates of his palace on the site of Guildhall. Early carvings of Gog and Magog were destroyed in Guildhall during the Great Fire of London. They were replaced in 1708 by a large pair of wooden statues carved by Captain Richard Saunders. These giants, on whom the current versions are based, lasted for more than two hundred years before they were destroyed in the Blitz. They, in turn, were replaced by a new pair carved by David Evans in 1953 and given to the City of London by Alderman Sir George Wilkinson, who had been Lord Mayor in 1940 at the time of the destruction of the previous versions.\n\n\n== Functions ==\nGuildhall hosts many events throughout the year, the most notable one being the Lord Mayor's Banquet, which is held in honour of the immediate-past Lord Mayor and is the first to be hosted by the new Lord Mayor of the City of London. In keeping with tradition, it is at this banquet that the Prime Minister makes a major world affairs speech. One of the last acts of the outgoing Lord Mayor is to present prizes at the City of London School prize day at Guildhall. Other events include those of various law firms and award evenings for the Wine and Spirit Education Trust (WSET). The Worshipful Company of Carmen holds its cart-marking ceremony in the courtyard each July.\nIn 1992 during the Ruby Jubilee of Elizabeth II, a lunch was held at Guildhall to mark the 40th year of the Queen's reign. Elizabeth II made a famous 'annus horribilis' speech after the 1992 Windsor Castle fire and the separation of two of her children.\n\n\n== Guildhall Bar ==\nThe members' bar in the Guildhall is a highly subsidised facility for members of the Court of Common Council and the Court of Aldermen. Access to the facilities is a privilege for life, even after an individual ceases to be a member of either of these courts. Members can also entertain guests there. It is substantially cheaper than any other bar in the City of London, as it is subsidised from the City's Cash, a sovereign wealth fund.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGuild\nPeterscourt\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBaddeley, John James.

    "wikipediaText": "St Olave's Church, Hart Street, is a Church of England church in the City of London, located on the corner of Hart Street and Seething Lane near Fenchurch Street railway station.\nJohn Betjeman described St Olave's as \"a country church in the world of Seething Lane.\" The church is one of the smallest in the city and is one of only a handful of medieval City churches that escaped the Great Fire of London in 1666. In addition to being a local parish church, St Olave's is the Ward Church of the Tower Ward of the City of London.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe church is first recorded in the 13th century as St Olave-towards-the-Tower, a stone building replacing the earlier (presumably wooden) construction. It is dedicated to the patron saint of Norway, King Olaf II of Norway, who fought alongside the Anglo-Saxon King Ãthelred the Unready against the Danes in the Battle of London Bridge in 1014. He was canonised after his death and the church of St Olave's was built apparently on the site of the battle. The Norwegian connection was reinforced during the Second World War when King Haakon VII of Norway worshipped there while in exile.\nSaint Olave's was rebuilt in the 13th century and then again in the 15th century. The present building dates from around 1450. According to John Stow's Survey of London (1603), a major benefactor of the church in the late 15th century was wool merchant Richard Cely Sr. (d. 1482), who held the advowson on the church (inherited by his son, Richard Cely Jr.). On his death, Cely bequeathed money for making the steeple and an altar in the church. The merchant mark of the Cely family was carved in two of the corbels in the nave (and were extant until the bombing of World War II). No memorial to the Celys now remains in the church.\nSaint Olave's survived the Great Fire of London with the help of Sir William Penn, the father of the more famous William Penn who founded Pennsylvania, and his men from the nearby Naval yards. He had ordered the men to blow up the houses surrounding the church to create a fire break. The flames came within 100 yards or so of the building, but then the wind changed direction, saving the church and a number of other churches on the eastern side of the city.\nThe church was a favourite of the diarist Samuel Pepys, whose house and Royal Navy office were both on Seething Lane. A regular worshipper, he referred to St. Olave's in his diary affectionately as \"our own church\" In 1660, he had a gallery built on the south wall of the church and added an outside stairway from the Royal Navy Offices so that he could go to church without getting soaked by the rain. The gallery is now gone but a memorial to Pepys marks the location of the stairway's door. In 1669, when his beloved wife Elisabeth died from fever, Pepys had a marble bust of her made by John Bushnell and installed on the north wall of the sanctuary so that he would be able to see her from his pew at the services. In 1703, he was buried next to his wife in the nave.\n\nIn his 1861 work, The Uncommercial Traveller, Charles Dickens described the 17th century gateway of Saint Olave's churchyard, which has skulls and crossbones carved in its tympanum, as being \"one of my best beloved churchyards, I call the churchyard of Saint Ghastly Grim\" and recounts once visiting it after midnight during a thunderstorm to see the skulls \"having the air of a public execution\".\nHowever, the church was gutted by German bombs in 1941 during the London Blitz, and was restored in 1954, with King Haakon returning to preside over the rededication ceremony, during which he laid a stone from Trondheim Cathedral in front of the sanctuary.\nBetween 1948 and 1954, when the restored St Olave's was reopened, a prefabricated church stood on the site of All Hallows Staining. This was known as St Olave Mark Lane. The tower of All Hallows Staining was used as the chancel of the temporary church.\nThe church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950. St Olave's has retained long and historic links with Trinity House and the Clothworkers' Company.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nSt Olave's has a modest exterior in the Perpendicular Gothic style. with a somewhat squat square tower of stone and brick, the latter added in 1732. It is famous for the macabre 1658 entrance arch to the churchyard, which is decorated with grinning skulls. The novelist Charles Dickens was so taken with this that he included the church in his book of sketches The Uncommercial Traveller, renaming it \"St Ghastly Grim\".\nThe interior of St Olave's only partially survived the wartime bombing; much of it dates from the restoration of the 1950s. It is nearly square, with three bays separated by columns of Purbeck limestone supporting pointed arches. The roof is a simple oak structure with bosses. Most of the church fittings are modern, but there are some significant survivals, such as the monument to Elizabeth Pepys and the pulpit, said to be the work of Grinling Gibbons. Following the destruction of the organ in the Blitz, the John Compton Organ Company built a new instrument in the West Gallery, fronted by a large wooden grille; this organ, and the Rectory behind, is ingeniously structured between church and tower.\nIn the tower, there was a memorial with an American connection. It honors Monkhouse Davison and Abraham Newman, the grocers of Fenchurch Street who shipped crates of tea to Boston in late 1773. These crates were seized and thrown into the waters during the Boston Tea Party, one of the causes of the American War of Independence.\nPerhaps the oddest \"person\" said to be buried here is the \"Pantomime character\" Mother Goose. Her burial was recorded by the parish registers on 14 September 1586. A plaque on the outside commemorates this event. The churchyard is also said to contain the grave of one Mary Ramsay, popularly believed to be the woman who brought the Plague to London in 1665. The parish registers have the record of her burial, which was on 24 July 1665. Thereafter, in the same year, the victims of the Great Plague were marked with a 'p' after their names in the registers.\n\n\n== Bells ==\nOn the east side of St Olave's, there is a stained glass window depicting Queen Elizabeth I standing with two tall bells at her feet. She held a thanksgiving service at St Olave's on Trinity Sunday, 15 May 1554, while she was still Princess Elizabeth, to celebrate her release from the Tower of London. She had originally given bell-ropes of silk to the All Hallows Staining Church because its bells had rung the loudest of all London bells on the day of her freedom, but, when All Hallows Staining was merged with St. Olave's in 1870, the bell-ropes went with it.\nOn 11 May 1941, an incendiary bomb was dropped by the Luftwaffe on the tower of the church. The tower, along with the baptistry and other buildings, was burned out and the furnishings and monuments destroyed. The heat was so great that even the peal of the eight bells were melted \"back into bell metal\". In the early 1950s, the bell metal was recast into new bells by the same foundry that created the original bells â the Whitechapel Bell Foundry, in 1662 and 1694. The new bells were then hung in the rebuilt tower.\nThere are currently nine bells at St Olave's Hart Street consisting of one Sanctus bell and a ring of eight bells hung for full circle ringing, with the tenor of the eight weighing 11â3â23. The bells are usually rung for practices, which take place on Thursday evenings between 7:00 pm and 8:30 pm during term time, and for Sunday service between 12:20 pm and 13:00 pm every Sunday. The bells are currently rung by the University of London Society of Change Ringers (ULSCR) who have a healthy band consisting of past and present members of London Universities, along with other regular supporters.\n\n\n== Organ ==\nAn organ was built by Samuel Green and finished in 1781. Organists include Mary Hudson, William Shrubsole, and John Turene  â all appointed 21 December 1781.\nThe 1781 organ was destroyed in the Blitz in 1941. After the war, a new organ was built behind a wooden grille in the west gallery by the John Compton Organ Company in 1954.  It was built on the extension principle with six ranks.  in 1957 three additional ranks were added.  It now has 43 stops controlled from a drawstop console in the west gallery [1].\n\n\n== Peter Turner ==\n\nPeter Turner was a notable physician in the 16th and early 17th century and adherent of Paracelsus, and was buried in the church along with his father William Turner, also a famed physician and naturalist. When he died in 1614, a memorial bust was crafted and placed in the south-east corner of the church. When the church was gutted during the Blitz, the bust went missing. It was not seen until April 2010 when it reappeared at a UK art auction. When it was recognised, the sale was frozen and negotiations took place via the Art Loss Register to return the bust to the church. It was finally returned to its original location within St Olave's in 2011 after an absence of more than 70 years.\n\n\n== Notable people associated with the church ==\nQueen Elizabeth I of England: held a thanksgiving service here in 1554 on the day of her release from the nearby Tower of London\nAn Inuit man, the first Inuk to come to England when he was captured during Martin Frobisher's first voyage in search of the Northwest Passage in 1576, was buried here in late October the same year.

    "wikipediaText": "The Church of St Mary-le-Bow () is a Church of England parish church in the City of London, England. Located on Cheapside, one of the city's oldest thoroughfares, the church was founded in 1080, by Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury. Rebuilt several times over the ensuing centuries, the present church is the work of Sir Christopher Wren, following the Great Fire of London (1666). With its tall spire, it is still a landmark in the City of London, being the third highest of any Wren church, surpassed only by nearby St Paul's Cathedral and St Bride's, Fleet Street. At a cost of over Â£15,000, it was also his second most expensive, again only surpassed by St Paul's Cathedral.\nSt Mary-le-Bow is widely known for its bells, which also feature in the nursery rhyme 'Oranges and Lemons'. According to legend, Dick Whittington heard the bells calling him back to the city in 1392, leading him to become Lord Mayor. Traditionally, anyone born within earshot of the bells was considered to be a true Londoner, or Cockney.\nThe church suffered severe damage by the Luftwaffe in the Second World War as part of the Blitz, like many churches in London. The interior was reduced to a shell and though the tower survived, fire damage made the bells crash to the floor. The church was sympathetically restored to its pre-war condition by Laurence King from 1956 to 1964. The church was awarded Grade I listed status, the highest possible rating, on the National Heritage List for England, whilst still a shell in 1950.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\nThough archaeological excavations suggest an earlier Saxon building may have stood on the site prior to the Norman Conquest, the first confirmed church dedicated to St Mary on Cheapside was built by Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1080. Lanfranc, who was William the Conqueror's archbishop brought over from Normandy, founded the church as part of the Norman policy of dominating London. Three major buildings were constructed as part of this policy; St Paul's Cathedral, the Tower of London, and a church on Cheapside.\nThe church at Cheapside was dedicated to St Mary and was constructed from Caen stone from Normandy, the same stone used in the Tower of London. The architect for the Tower of London was Gundulf, Bishop of Rochester, who may have also designed the first St Mary-le-Bow. This early church was built on two levels, with a lower undercroft partially below street level and the upper church, built above it. The lower church was constructed first and featured round stone arches, which were a novelty at the time. This led to the church being known as Sancta Maria de Arcubus (St Mary of the Arches), a name which eventually became St Mary-le-Bow, bow being an old name for arches.\n\n\n=== 11th and 12th centuries ===\nThe church was nearing completion in 1091 when it was destroyed by a violent tornado, amongst the most powerful ever to strike England. Roof rafters measuring 27â28 feet (8.2â8.5 m) long were thrown up in the air and forced into the ground with such force that only their tips remained visible. The lower church survived, but the upper church was damaged beyond repair. The church was rebuilt, possibly in facsimile, but was destroyed again just a hundred years later, in a fire in 1196. The fire was caused by fugitive William Fitz Osbert hiding in the church tower, and to coax him out, supporters of the Archbishop of Canterbury set fire to the church. Osbert was fatally stabbed as he fled.\n\n\n=== Late medieval period ===\n\nThe church was rebuilt again in the early 13th century following the 1196 fire, becoming a peculiar of the Archbishops of Canterbury and their London headquarters. It became home to the Court of Arches, to which the church gave its name. The Court of Arches, which still has its home at St Mary-le-Bow today, was the ecclesiastical court of appeal for the Province of Canterbury, founded in 1251. This allegiance to Canterbury made it the second most important church in London, after St Paul's Cathedral.\nThe tower partially collapsed in its south west corner in 1271, killing at least one civilian in Cheapside below, Laurence Ducket. The tower was not immediately repaired and was kept in use. From 1363 onwards, the tower's principal use was the housing of the city's curfew bell, rung at 9 pm every evening and being able to be heard as far away as Hackney Marshes.\nWork to repair the tower was slow, with construction noted to take place in 1448, 1459 and 1479. The tower was finally completed in 1512, supporting a spectacular series of stone lanterns; four around the corners of the tower and one suspended in the centre by arches. These lanterns were designed to light the streets below.\n\n\n==== Destruction during the Great Fire of London (1666) ====\nSoon after midnight on Sunday, 2 September 1666, a fire started in Thomas Farriner's bakery on Pudding Lane, 0.7 kilometres (0.43 mi) to the southeast of St. Mary-le-Bow. During the course of the night, the easterly wind spread the fire through the city, consuming 300 houses in the first night alone. The fire continued to grow, becoming a firestorm on Monday and sweeping west towards St Paul's Cathedral.\nSt Mary-le-Bow was one of over fifty churches to catch fire during the firestorm, which was only extinguished on the Thursday. The church was nearly completely destroyed, except for the tower, which survived albeit with fire damage. Attempts were made to repair the tower, but they all ultimately failed: the tower was structurally compromised from the fire and was no longer strong enough to support the ringing of bells.\n\n\n=== Wren rebuilding ===\nFollowing Christopher Wren's appointment as the King's Surveyor of Works in 1669, Wren's office was contracted to rebuild the fifty one churches of the city consumed by the fire. The Rebuilding of London Act 1670 provided the funds for this, as it included raising the tax on coal. Other than St Paul's Cathedral, St Mary-le-Bow was considered the most important church in the city, and thus, according to a document dated to 13 June 1670, at the head of the list to be rebuilt. The mason's contract for the rebuilding of St Mary-le-Bow was signed just under two months later, on 2 August.\nWren's initial designs were for a simple three bay structure and short tower, the latter topped by a simple cupola. This was revised in the same year with a much taller tower and more intricate spire. The body of the church, inspired by the Basilica of Maxentius in Rome, was completed by 1673. The tower, however, would take a further seven years to finish, being finally completed in 1680. The total cost of the rebuilding was Â£15,421 (equivalent to more than Â£2.3 million in 2021), the second most expensive of any of Wren's churches, only surpassed by St Paul's. The tower was rebuilt in Portland stone, the rest of the church in brick. The tower became such a landmark that it was known as the \"Cheapside pillar\".\nDuring the rebuilding, Wren moved the position of the tower to sit directly on Cheapside, whereas the Norman and Tudor towers had sat back from the road. Whilst building the foundations for the tower, Wren came across an old Roman causeway 18 feet (5.5 m) below ground level and 4 feet (1.2 m) deep, which provided a solid foundation. Wren also discovered the 11th century undercroft below the ruins, but he was uninterested, believing it to be Roman. He only provided a trapdoor and ladder into the undercroft, which became the crypt for the church above it.\n\n\n=== 18th â 20th centuries ===\nIn 1820, the upper part of the spire was rebuilt and repaired by architect George Gwilt. In 1850, the church finally ceased to be a 'peculiar', coming under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of London, ending a practice started six hundred years earlier. The church continued, however, to be the home of the Court of Arches. Further alterations took place in the late 19th century, with the removal of galleries in 1867 and additional modifications from 1878-1879.\n\nIn 1914, a stone from the crypt of the church was placed in Trinity Church, New York, to mark the fact that William III granted the vestry of Trinity Church the same privileges as St Mary-le-Bow vestry.\n\n\n==== Second World War ====\nBeginning in 1940, the Luftwaffe began bombarding British cities from the air, a campaign known as the Blitz; London was struck especially heavily. Throughout most of the campaign, St Mary-le-Bow suffered only minor damage. However, on the final night of the Blitz, 10â11 May 1941, the church took several direct hits. A major fire started, destroying most of the building except the outer walls and the tower. The tower was not directly hit, but the fires from the church interior spread, burning out the tower floors and causing its bells to crash to the floor. The use of Portland stone in the tower, rather than the brick used in the body of the church, contributed to its survival.\nFrom 1956 to 1964, the church was sympathetically rebuilt and restored by Laurence King to Wren's designs, at a cost of Â£63,000. The tower survived, mostly as Wren left it, but part of it required rebuilding due to fire damage weakening the walls. The church was reconsecrated in 1964, achieving Grade I listed status whilst still a ruin in 1950.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Plan ===\n\nThe church building has a rectangular plan, with the tower situated on the northwest corner, separated from the main body of the church by a vestibule. The design of the church is such that the chancel occupies the eastern end of the nave, both with north and south aisles, which are noted to be extremely narrow. A vestry adjoins the vestibule to the north of the north aisle.\nUnusually, due to the addition of the vestibule separating the tower and nave, the building has a greater length north to south than east to west; measuring 79 feet (24 m) from east to west but 131 feet (40 m) from the north wall of the tower to the south wall of the nave. The total area of the church building is 761 square metres (8,190 sq ft), which according to the Church of England, makes it a \"large\" sized church building.\n\n\n=== Exterior ===\nThe exterior of St Mary-le-Bow is mostly constructed from red brick with dressings of Portland stone, with the exception of the tower, which is built entirely from Portland stone. The three principal facades of the building (south, north and east) have gabled walls and pedimented centres, complete with triplets of round-headed windows. The most prominent aspect of the exterior is Wren's imposing tower, measuring 30 feet (9.1 m) square externally and with a height of 221 feet 9 inches (67.6 m), it is the third highest of any Wren church.\nThe tower, constructed of Portland stone, is formed of four stages surmounted by an elaborate stone spire. The lowest stage has doorways in the north and west faces of the tower, set in substantial stone recess with added rustication. The recess has a round head and is flanked by Doric order columns, which support a moulded entablature above. The doorways inside these recesses are set between Tuscan order columns which support a Doric frieze. The second and third stages of the tower are more simple in construction, with two large square windows to the second stage, and a single round-headed window to the third. The fourth stage, housing the bell chamber, has a large round-headed opening in each wall, divided into three sections by thin mullions and filled with louvre boards. Framing the bell openings are pairs of Ionic order pilasters supporting an entablature, above which is the parapet. The parapet comprises an open balustrade between four corner pinnacles, formed of four ogee scrolls topped with small stone vases.\n\nThe spire above the tower is also formed of four stages. The lowest stage is a circular drum-shaped structure surrounded by twelve columns which have carved acanthus capitals. These twelve columns support a cornice with modillion decoration. Above the cornice is a second open balustrade, similar in design to that on the top of the tower. The second stage is formed of twelve curved flying buttresses which support a circular-shaped moulded cornice. The third stage stands on the base of the cornice, and is square in plan, with granite columns on the corners. These columns support the fourth and final stage of the spire, which takes the form of a tall, square, tapering pinnacle, surmounted by a ball and weathervane, the latter taking the shape of a winged dragon. \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Interior ===\nOnly three bays make up the nave of the church, which is divided into small aisles by large round-headed arches. These arches are supported by compound piers with attached demi-columns that feature shorter pilasters for the openings and Corinthian capitals for the nave and aisles. The tunnel vault above the nave is covered in ornamental panelling that is painted blue and white and is penetrated by the clerestory windows.\nThe church windows are among the structure's most prominent elements following its 1964 restoration. They, along with the other furniture, vestments, etc., were created by John Hayward. All three of the east windows have rounded arches, although the central window is taller and wider than its neighbours, who have small round windows above them.\nLinking the church and tower is a vestibule, featuring a tall groin-vaulted stone ceiling. The top of the vault is pierced by a removable circular trapdoor, opened to allow the bells to be lowered or raised from the tower.\n\nBeneath the church, built on almost the same floorplan, is the 11th-century crypt. The crypt, originally built as the undercroft for the church destroyed in the tornado in 1091, is three bays in length and features Norman-era round arches, some of which contain Roman bricks, and a groined vault. The crypt is now in use as the \"CafÃ© Below\". \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Music ==\n\n\n=== Organ ===\n\nThe earliest record of an organ at the church dates to 1802 when Hugh Russell of London built a small instrument formed of 13 stops and 2 manuals. This organ, like its successors, was situated on a gallery above the west doors. This organ lasted until 1867, when George Maydwell Holdich, also of London, rebuilt and enlarged the organ. He added a third manual, a pedalboard and 11 additional stops to make a total of 24.\nIn 1880, the organ was purchased by Walker & Sons at a cost of Â£255 and transferred to the Methodist Church at Thornton, Leicestershire. Walker & Sons constructed a new instrument for St Mary-le-Bow in the same year, at a cost of Â£1,108. This new instrument was much larger, formed of 33 stops and 3 manuals plus a pedalboard and was situated in the sanctuary at the eastern end of the church. This organ lasted unaltered until the Blitz, when following the first strike to hit the church, which only caused minor damage, it was removed for safekeeping by Rushworth and Draper.\nFollowing the restoration of the church from 1956, the organ was remodelled in 1964. The organ was reduced in size by almost half, only 18 of the original 33 stops were reinstated and a new case designed and installed above the west door. This organ was considered by many to be a rather poor imitation of its pre-war condition but funds did not permit its replacement for 40 years.\nIn 2004, a project to replace the organ was launched by the church, with Kenneth Ticknell & Co chosen as builders. The project, which cost Â£380,000, was funded by corporate and personal donors. In January 2010, the old organ was removed, though the 1964 case, based on work by the Alsace Silbermann family, was kept. The organ was completed in August 2010 and the first recital was given by Thomas Trotter on 29 September. The new organ, which reuses the old case, has 34 stops and two manuals plus pedalboard.\nThe church also has a small chamber organ, formed of 1 manual and with 5 stops, made by an unknown builder. It is situated in the south nave aisle.\n\n\n=== Bells ===\n\n\n==== History ====\n\n\n===== Early bells =====\nThe bells at St Mary-le-Bow are often considered to be the most famous peal in the world. According to legend, Richard (Dick) Whittington heard the bells in 1392 when he left the city, calling him back and leading him to become Lord Mayor. The earliest written record of bells at the church is in 1469, when the Common Council orders a curfew bell should be rung at St Mary-le-Bow at 9.00 each evening. In 1515, William Copland, one of Henry VIII's merchants, gave money for a \"great bell\" to be installed, with directions it should be rung to announce the curfew. With Copland's gift, the tower then contained five bells.\nIn the 1552 survey of church goods ordered by Edward VI, the tower is recorded as containing five bells with two additional \"sanctus\" bells. These five bells would later be augmented, when in 1635, six are recorded. In 1666, during the Great Fire of London, the bells and tower, along with the church, were damaged beyond repair.\nFollowing the Great Fire and Wren's rebuilding of the church, the tenor bell of a proposed ring of eight was cast by Christopher Hodson of St Mary Cray in 1669, placed in a temporary structure in the churchyard until the tower was completed. The bell weighed approximately 52 long cwt (2,600 kg). In 1677, Hodson cast the remaining seven and hung all eight bells in the newly completed tower in a new oak frame.\n\n\n===== 18th and 19th centuries =====\nNo further work would take place to the bells until 1738 when the tenor bell was recast by Richard Phelps and Thomas Lester; Phelps had previously cast the hour bell at St Paul's Cathedral, called Great Tom, which still survives today. In 1762, Lester & Pack recast and rehung the other seven bells and added two more, to make a ring of ten, keeping the Hodson frame. The bells were rehung again in 1835 by Thomas Mears of Whitechapel and then a third time by Mears & Stainbank in 1863.\nIn 1881, Mears & Stainbank cast two new bells to augment the ring to twelve, rehanging the 3rd and 4th bells concurrently. This gave London its 5th ring of twelve, following St Bride's, Fleet Street; St Michael Cornhill; St Paul's Cathedral; and St Giles Cripplegate. In 1902, the bells needed rehanging again, with work taking place to the heaviest three bells by Gillett & Johnston of Croydon. This was evidently not successful, for the bells needed rehanging just 5 years later, the work given to Mears & Stainbank of Whitechapel again.\n\n\n===== Selfridge's ring =====\n\nIn January 1927, following the deterioration of the fittings and the condition of the tower, the bells were declared unringable in a report first published by The Times. Over the ensuing six years, much work was done to the tower and the church to restore it, but the bells remained unringable, to much public outcry. Finally, in 1933, Harry Gordon Selfridge offered to defray the cost of restoring the bells, an offer which was accepted by the church, who gave the contract to Gillett & Johnston, who Selfridge had worked with a few years previously on bells for his Oxford Street store.\nThe announcement that Gillett & Johnston intended to recast the tenor, which was believed to be cracked, caused so many objections that a meeting of the Province of Canterbury's ecclesiastical court was called; the decision of the court was eventually that the tenor should be recast. Gillett & Johnston found upon removing the bells to their works in Croydon that four more of the bells (6, 7, 8 and 10) were cracked, in addition to the tenor. All five cracked bells were recast in addition to the three lightest bells, leaving only the 4th, 5th, 9th and 11th from the previous ring to be retained; these four bells were retuned. The bells were rehung in their original frame with new cast iron headstocks, ball bearings and wrought iron clappers. The frame was substantially strengthened with a massive concrete and steel grillage weighing 3.5 long tonnes (3,556 kg). The bells were rededicated by the Archbishop of Canterbury on 7 July 1933.\nShortly after their installation, the BBC World Service recorded the bells for use as a time signal, which brought the attention of the bells to a global audience; the recording survives today. On the night of 10 May 1941, the church was struck by several incendiary bombs. Though the tower was spared a direct hit, the flames from the body of the church were fanned into the tower, which acted like a furnace, destroying all of the internal floors and the frame, causing the bells to crash over 100 feet (30 m) to the ground, irrevocably damaging them.\n\n\n===== Post-war restoration =====\n\nThe damaged bells were removed shortly after their destruction to Mears & Stainbank's foundry in Whitechapel, but they remained in storage for more than 10 years. In 1956, as the restoration of the church began, attention turned to the restoration of the tower and the recasting of the bells. Much of the cost of restoring the tower and bells was met by the Bernard Sunley Charitable Foundation and Trinity Church, Wall Street, New York City. A new ring of twelve was cast by Mears & Stainbank in 1956, partially reusing metal salvaged from the 1933 ring. However, due to the condition of the tower, which required repairs, the bells were not hung until late 1961.\nThe bells were dedicated in the presence of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh by Robert Stopford, Bishop of London, on 21 December 1961. The tenor was tolled by Prince Philip at the beginning of the service. The bells were hung in a new frame, made of Javanese Jang (Dipterocarpus terminatus). Since then, the bells have been frequently rung, both by members of the Ancient Society of College Youths who reside in or near the city, and by visiting bands of ringers, who come from across the world to ring the bells.\nAll the bells are named and each bell has an inscription from Psalms, the first letter of each forming the acrostic 'D. Whittington'. The largest bell weighs 41 long cwt 3 qrs 21 lb (4,697 lb or 2,131 kg), the third heaviest tenor bell in London after St Paul's and Southwark Cathedral.\n\n\n==== Specification ====\n\n\n==== In popular culture ====\nThe bells, often considered amongst the most famous in the world, have typically been used to define whether or not one is a true Londoner or Cockney; anyone born within their earshot is considered such. With the urbanisation of the City of London in the 20th and 21st centuries, the increasing population, noise pollution and the soundproofing measures installed in the belfry, the range of the Bow bells is significantly smaller than at its peak.\nIn 1851, the bells could be heard across north and east London, as far as Hackney Marshes, Stratford and Limehouse, with reports that they could also be heard south of the Thames in Southwark. An acoustic study taken in 2012 shows that this range has shrunk substantially, and is now confined to the eastern parts of the Square Mile and Shoreditch. With no maternity hospitals within this range and only limited residential properties, arguably the modern chance of the birth of a 'true' cockney is now very low.\nThe bells are also mentioned in the nursery rhyme \"Oranges and Lemons\": \"I do not know, says the Great Bell of Bow\".\nOrdinarily, distances by road from London are now measured from Charing Cross but, before the late 18th century, they were measured from the London Stone in Cannon Street, or the Standard in Cornhill. However, on the road from London to Lewes, the mileage is taken from the church door of St Mary-le-Bow. To note the reference point used, mileposts along the way are marked with the rebus in cast-iron of a bow and four bells.\nThe church is also mentioned in the song \"The London Boys\" by David Bowie (\"â¦ Bow Bell strikes another nightâ¦\").\nThe West Ham United F.C. away shirt for the 2024/25 season features a graphic representation of the St Mary-le-Bow woven into the fabric along with a reference to the church's bells on the back of the neck.\n\n\n== Services ==\nSt Mary-le-Bow ministers to the financial industry and livery companies of the City of London. Consequently, services are held on weekdays rather than the more traditional Sunday morning. Services generally consist of two sessions of 15 minute prayer, one at 8.30 am and another at 5.45 pm on every weekday. These are supplemented by two more formal services of Eucharist, one on a Wednesday lunchtime at 1.05 pm and the second on a Thursday evening at 6.05pm.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHoward Colvin, Biographical Dictionary of British Architects\nMichael Byrne and George R.

    "wikipediaText": "St Clement Eastcheap is a Church of England parish church in Candlewick Ward of the City of London. It is located on Clement's Lane, off King William Street and close to London Bridge and the River Thames.\nClement was a disciple of St Peter the Apostle and was ordained as Bishop of Rome in the year 93 AD. By legend, Clement was martyred by being tied to an anchor and thrown into the Black Sea, which led to his adoption as a patron saint of sailors. The dedication to St Clement is unusual in London, with only one other ancient church there dedicated to this saint, namely St Clement Danes, Westminster. It is also located a little north of the Thames, but further west from Eastcheap and outside the old City boundary, just beyond the Temple Bar on the Strand.  Both churches claim to be the \"Clements\" referred to in the children's nursery rhyme Oranges and Lemons.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Medieval period ===\nEastcheap was one of the main streets of medieval London. The name 'Eastcheap' derives from the Saxon word 'cheap', meaning a market, and Eastcheap was so called to distinguish it from Westcheap, later to become Cheapside. The southern end of Clement's Lane opened onto Eastcheap until the 1880s when the construction of King William Street separated Clement's Lane from Eastcheap, which still remains nearby as a street.\n\nThe church's dedication to a Roman patron saint of sailors, the martyr Bishop Clement, coupled with its location near to what were historically the bustling wharves of Roman London, hints at a much earlier Roman origin. Indeed, Roman remains were once found in Clement's Lane, comprising walls 3 feet thick and made of flints at a depth of 12â15 feet together with tessellated pavements.\nA charter of 1067 given by William I (1028â87) to Westminster Abbey mentions a church of St. Clement, which is possibly St. Clement Eastcheap, but the earliest definite reference to the church is found in a deed written in the reign of Henry III (1207â72), which mentions 'St Clement Candlewickstrate'. Other early documents refer to the church as \"St Clement in Candlewystrate\", 'St Clement the Little by Estchepe' and 'St Clement in Lumbard Street'. Until the dissolution of the monasteries â during the reign of Henry VIII â the parish was in the 'gift' of the Abbot of Westminster, then patronage of the parish passed to the Bishop of London. Now the patronage alternates with the appointment of each successive new parish priest (Rector), between the Bishop of London and the Dean and Chapter of St Paul's.\nAccording to the London historian John Strype (1643â1737) St. Clement's church was repaired and beautified in 1630 and 1633.\n\n\n=== Destruction and rebuilding ===\nIn 1666 the church was destroyed by the Great Fire of London, and then rebuilt in the 1680s. According to Strype the rebuilt church was designed by Sir Christopher Wren and this would seem to be confirmed by the fact that in the parish account for 1685 there is the following item: To one third of a hogshead of wine, given to Sir Christopher Wren, Â£4 2s.  The construction was by Edward Strong the Elder.\nIn 1670, during the rebuilding of London that followed the fire, the parish was combined with that of St Martin Orgar, which lay on the south side of Eastcheap. At the same time the City planners sought to appropriate a strip of land from the west of St Clement's property to widen Clement's Lane. This led to a dispute with the parish authorities, who claimed that the proposed plan left too little room to accommodate the families of the newly combined parishes. The matter was resolved by permitting the addition of a 14 ft. building plot, formerly occupied by the churchyard, to the east of the church. It was not until 1683, however, that building of the church began,  and was completed in 1687 at a total cost of Â£4,365.\nAlthough nearby St Martin Orgar had been left in ruins by the Great Fire, the tower survived and, following the unification of the parish with St Clement's, the St Martin's site was used by French Huguenots who restored the tower and worshiped there until 1820. Later in the decade the ruins of the body of St Martin's church were removed to make way for the widening of Cannon Street, but the tower remained until 1851 when it was taken down, and â curiously â replaced with a new tower. The new tower served as a rectory for St. Clement Eastcheap until it was sold and converted into offices in the 1970s; it still survives on the present-day Martin Lane.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nIn May 1840 Edward John Carlos wrote in The Gentleman's Magazine, protesting about the proposed demolition of St Bartholomew-by-the-Exchange and St. Benet Fink, following a fire in 1838 that had razed the Royal Exchange and damaged those two churches. In his article, Carlos referred to earlier plans to reduce the number of City churches, from which we learn that in the 1830s St Clement's had been under threat of demolition.\n\nThe sweeping design of destroying a number of City churches was mediated in â¦ 1834, and for the time arrested by the resolute opposition to the measure in the instance of the first church marked out for sacrifice, St. Clement Eastcheap, it may be feared is at length coming into full operation, not, indeed in the open manner in which it was displayed at that period, but in an insidious and more secure mode of procedure.\nWhile St Clement's was spared, the 19th century saw many other City churches being destroyed, particularly following the Union of Benefices Act (1860), which sought to speed-up the reduction in the number of City parishes as a response to rapidly declining congregations; the result of the resident population moving in ever larger numbers from cramped City conditions to the more spacious suburbs.\nIn 1872 William Butterfield, a prominent architect of the gothic-revival, substantially renovated St. Clement's to conform with the contemporary Anglican 'High Church' taste. The renovation involved removing the galleries; replacing the 17th-century plain windows with stained glass; dividing the reredos into three pieces and placing the two wings on the side walls;  dismantling the woodwork to build new pews;  laying down polychrome tiles on the floor, and moving the organ into the aisle.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1933 the architect Sir Ninian Comper revised Butterfield's layout, moving the organ to its original position on the west wall and reassembling the reredos behind the altar, although before he did so, he had the reredos painted with figures in blue and gold.\nSt. Clement's suffered minor damage from bombing by German aircraft during the London Blitz in 1940 during the Second World War. The damage was repaired in 1949â50, and in 1968 the church was again redecorated.\n\n\n=== Present ===\nToday St Clement's holds weekly services and, from 1998 to 2011, it was the base of The Players of St Peter, an amateur theatre company devoted to performing medieval mystery plays in the church, around early December each year. The Players are now based at the church of St George in the East.\n\nA number of charities have their administrative offices at St Clement's. The Cure Parkinson's Trust was based here for several years but is now at 120 Baker Street, London.\n\n\n== \"Oranges and Lemons\" ==\nSt Clement Eastcheap considers itself to be the church referred to in the nursery rhyme that begins \"Oranges and lemons / Say the bells of St Clement's\". So too does St Clement Danes Church, Westminster, whose bells ring out the traditional tune of the nursery rhyme three times a day.\nThere is a canard that the earliest mention of the rhyme occurs in Wynkyn de Worde's \"The demaundes joyous\" printed in 1511. This small volume consists entirely of riddles and makes no allusion to bells, St. Clement or any other church.\nAccording to Iona and Peter Opie, the earliest record of the rhyme only dates to c.1744, although there is a square dance (without words) called 'Oranges and Limons' in the 3rd edition of John Playford's The English Dancing Master, published in 1665.\nSt Clement Eastcheap's claim is based on the assertion that it was close to the wharf where citrus fruit was unloaded. Yet, a perusal of a map of London shows that there were many churches, even after the Fire, that were closer to the Thames than St. Clement's (St. George Botolph Lane, St Magnus the Martyr, St. Michael, Crooked Lane, St Martin Orgar, St Mary-at-Hill, All Hallows the Great. All these would have been passed by a load of oranges and lemons making its way to Leadenhall Market, the nearest market where citrus fruit was sold, passing several more churches on the way. Thus, it would appear that the name of St. Clements was selected by the rhymer simply for its consonance with the word âlemonsâ, and it now seems more likely that the melody called âOranges and Limonsâ predates the rhyme itself.\n\n\n== Building ==\n\nSt. Clement Eastcheap has an irregular plan. The nave is approximately rectangular, but the south aisle is severely tapered. The ceiling is divided into panels, the centre one being a large oval band of fruit and flowers. The main faÃ§ade is on the west, on Clement's Lane, and comprises four bays. The main bay has a blocked pedimented round-headed window over the door. This is flanked by matching bays with two levels of windows. The tower to the south west forms the fourth bay. This is a simple square tower, with a parapet, but no spire. Each bay has stone quoins and is stuccoed, except for the upper levels of the tower where the brick is exposed.\nA small churchyard remains to the east of St. Clement's hemmed-in by the backs of office buildings and contains tombstones whose inscriptions have, over time, become illegible. The churchyard is approached by a narrow alley along the church's north wall, at the entrance of which is a memorial plaque to Dositej ObradoviÄ, a Serbian scholar who lived next to the church.\nIn July 1645, so it is said, the poet John Milton was reconciled with his estranged wife Mary Powell, in the house of a Mrs Weber, a widow, in St Clement's churchyard where Mary was then lodging. Milton's description in Paradise Lost of the reconciliation of Adam and Eve draws, apparently, on the real life reconciliation between Milton and his wife.\n\nThe church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.\n\n\n== Organ ==\nThe present organ's oak case is the same one made to enclose the organ that was built for St Clement's in 1696  by Renatus Harris who maintained the instrument until 1704. While the case has remained largely intact, the organ itself has been variously rebuilt and restored; in 1704 by Christian Smith, and in 1711 by Abraham Jordan (c.1666â1716)âwho it is thought added the swell organ to the two manual instrument. From 1838 the organ was in the care of Messrs Gray and Davison, who in 1872âas part of the renovation of the buildingâmoved the organ from the west gallery to the south aisle. Care of the organ was transferred to Henry Wedlake that same year. In 1889 he rebuilt the instrument. Further work was undertaken in 1926 by Messrs J. W. Walker, and  in 1936 by Messrs Hill, Norman and Beard, whew the instrument was moved back to an approximation of its original west-end location. The same company overhauled the organ in 1946, and in 1971 made 'neo-baroque' tonal revisions, which remain to this day. The instrument was last cleaned and repaired in 2004 by Colin Jilks of Sittingbourne, Kent.\n\n\n== Organists ==\n\nThe first known organist:\n\nHenry Lightindollar (died 1702), appeared in the parish records in 1699. Successive organists were as follows:\nWilliam Gorton, a member of the King's Music (appt. 1702, died 1711)\nEdward Purcell, son of Henry Purcell (born 1689, appt. 1711, died 1740, and buried in St Clements \"near the gallery door\" â Parish Burial Register, 4 July 1740)\nEdward Henry Purcell, Edward's son (appt.1740, died 1765, and also buried in the church \"by the organ gallery\" â Parish Burial Register, 5 August 1765)\nJonathan Battishill (born 1738, appt. 1765, died 1801)\nThomas Bartholomew (appt. 1802, died 1819)\nWilliam Bradley (appt. 1819, res. 1828)\nJohn Whitaker, a City music publisher, (appt. 1828, died 1847)\nJohn Joff, promoted from assistant organist (appt. 1847, died 1885).\nThe current organist (September 2008) is Ian Shaw.\n\n\n== Furnishings ==\nThe altar, with cherubs for legs, dates from the 17th century, as does the reredos, which was decorated during the 1930s restoration of the building in a style reminiscent of Simone Martini. The outer panels depict the Annunciation while the central panel shows St. Clement and St. Martin of Tours, (the dedicatee of St. Martin Orgar).\nThe pulpit also dates from the 17th-century, and is made from Norwegian oak, topped with an hexagonal sounding board, with a dancing cherub on each corner.\nSurviving from the 1872 Butterfield renovation are the polychrome floor and three stained-glass clerestory windows on the north wall. The windows were made by W. G. Taylor, and installed c.1887 during the last phase of Butterfield's work. The windows show SS. Andrew, James (major), James (minor), Peter, Mathias, and Thomas.\n\nWhile the marble font can be seen, its wooden cover is not always on public display. The cover's ornate decoration, a carved dove holding an olive branch surrounded with gilded flames, so delighted William Gladstone, it is said, that he took his grandchildren to see it.\n\n\n== Clergy ==\nThomas Fuller (1608â61), then living in London, preached a series of sermons at St Clement's in 1647.\nThe diarist John Evelyn heard John Pearson (1613â86), later to be Bishop of Chester, preaching at St Clement's where he was the weekly preacher from 1654. His sermons there later became his An Exposition of the Creed (1659), which he dedicated \"to the right worshipful and well-beloved, the parishioners of St. Clement's, Eastcheap.\"\nOne of the rectors of St. Clement's, Benjamin Stone, who had been presented to the living by Bishop Juxon, being deemed \"too Popish\" by Oliver Cromwell, was imprisoned for some time at Crosby Hall. From there he was sent to Plymouth where, after paying a fine of Â£60, he obtained his liberty. Stone recovered his benefice on the restoration of Charles II but died five years after. (Thornbury, volume 1)\nIn this church Josias Alsopp, who had succeeded Stone as rector in the early Restoration years of the 17th century, was heard preaching by Samuel Pepys who noted the following in his diary for 24 November 1661:\n\nUp early, and by appointment to St. Clement lanes to church, and there to meet Captain Cocke, who had often commended Mr. Alsopp, their minister, to me, who is indeed an able man, but as all things else did not come up to my expectations. His text was that all good and perfect gifts are from above.\nAmong the mural tablets in the church are three which have been erected at the cost of the parishioners, commemorative of the Rev. Thomas Green, curate twenty-seven years, who died in 1734; the Rev. John Farrer, Rector, who died in 1820; and the Rev. W. Valentine Ireson, who was lecturer of the united parishes for thirty years and died in 1822.\n\n\n== Memorial ==\n\nImmediately next to the church in Clement's Lane is a memorial stone to Dositej ObradoviÄ (1742â1811), a Serbian statesman and man of letters who became Serbia's first Education Minister. He stayed in a house here in 1784. His name here is anglicised to Dositey Obradovich.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of churches and cathedrals of London\nList of Christopher Wren churches in London\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nBetjeman, J (1967) The City of London Churches Andover: Pitkin (ISBN 0-85372-112-2)\nBlatch, Mervyn (1995) A Guide to London's Churches London: Constable\nClout, Hugh (ed.)

    "wikipediaText": "The Royal Exchange in London was founded in the 16th century by the merchant Sir Thomas Gresham on the suggestion of his factor Richard Clough to act as a centre of commerce for the City of London. The site was provided by the City of London Corporation and the Worshipful Company of Mercers, who still jointly own the freehold. The original foundation was ceremonially opened by Queen Elizabeth I who granted it its \"royal\" title. The current neoclassical building has a trapezoidal floor plan and is flanked by Cornhill and Threadneedle Street, which converge at Bank junction in the heart of the city. It lies in the Ward of Cornhill.\nThe exchange building has twice been destroyed by fire and subsequently rebuilt. The present building was designed by Sir William Tite in the 1840s. The site was notably occupied by the Lloyd's insurance market for nearly 150 years. Today, the Royal Exchange contains restaurants and luxury shops.\nTraditionally, the steps of the Royal Exchange are the place where certain royal proclamations (such as the dissolution of parliament) are read out by either a herald or a crier. Following the death or abdication of a monarch and the confirmation of the next monarch's accession to the throne by the Accession Council, the Royal Exchange Building is one of the locations where a herald proclaims the new monarch's reign to the public.\n\n\n== History ==\nRichard Clough initially suggested building the exchange in 1562, and its original design was inspired by the Antwerp bourse, the world's first purpose-built bourse, with which Thomas Gresham, the representative of the English crown in Antwerp, was familiar, and on which the designs of the bourses of Amsterdam (1611) and Rotterdam would also be based.\nIt was Britain's first specialist commercial building, and Clough oversaw the importing of some of the materials from Antwerp: stone, slate, wainscot and glass, for which he paid thousands of pounds himself. The Royal Exchange was officially opened on 23 January 1571 by Queen Elizabeth I, who awarded the building its royal title and a licence to sell alcohol and valuable goods. Only the exchange of goods took place until the 17th century. Stockbrokers were not allowed into the Royal Exchange because of their rude manners, hence they had to operate from other establishments in the vicinity, such as Jonathan's Coffee-House. Gresham's original building was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. \n\nTake a view of the Royal Exchange in London, a place more venerable than many courts of justice, where the representatives of all nations meet for the benefit of mankind. There the Jew, the Mahometan [Muslim], and the Christian transact together, as though they all professed the same religion, and give the name of infidel to none but bankrupts. There the Presbyterian confides in the Anabaptist, and the Churchman depends on the Quaker's word.\nA second complex was built on the site, designed by Edward Jarman and opened in 1669. It featured a tall wooden tower over the south entrance in Corn Hill; this eventually fell into disrepair and, in 1821, was replaced by a new stone tower and cupola designed by George Smith. The second Exchange was also burned down on 10 January 1838 in a fire caused by an overheated stove; the blaze was visible from Windsor, 24 miles (39 km) away. It had been used by the Lloyd's insurance market, which was forced to move temporarily to South Sea House following the 1838 fire.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Current building ===\nThe third Royal Exchange building, which still stands today, was designed by Sir William Tite and adheres to the original layoutâconsisting of a four-sided structure surrounding a central courtyard where merchants and tradesmen could do business. The internal works, designed by Edward I'Anson in 1837, made use of concreteâan early example of this modern construction method. It features pediment sculptures by Richard Westmacott (the younger), and ornamental cast ironwork by Henry Grissell's Regent's Canal Ironworks.  It was opened by Queen Victoria on 28 October 1844, though trading did not commence until 1 January 1845.\nPaul Julius Reuter established the Reuters news agency at No. 1, Royal Exchange Buildings (opposite and to the east of the Royal Exchange) in 1851. It later moved to Fleet Street.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Portico and pediment ===\n\nThe western end of the building consists of a portico of eight Corinthian columns topped by a pediment containing a tympanum with relief sculpture by Richard Westmacott (the younger) of seventeen figures representing London merchants and foreign traders. The central allegorical figure represents Commerce, above an inscription chosen by Albert, Prince Consort from Psalm 24: \"The Earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof\". The Latin inscription on the frieze states:\n\nAnno XIII. Elizabethae R. Conditvm; Anno VIII. Victoriae R. Restavratvm.\nor \"founded in the thirteenth year of Queen Elizabeth, and restored in the eighth of Queen Victoria\".\n\n\n=== Statues ===\n\nTwo statues stand in niches in the central courtyard. Charles II (a copy of 1792 by John Spiller after Grinling Gibbons' statue in the centre of the 17th century courtyard) and Queen Elizabeth I by Musgrave Watson, 1844. The Charles II statue survived the fire of 1838 that destroyed the previous Exchange. The Elizabeth I statue was commissioned as she was the monarch who had conferred the status \"Royal\" on the Exchange.\nIn front of the portico of the Royal Exchange is a statue of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, the last work of Sir Francis Leggatt Chantrey. The bronze used to cast it was donated by the government and sourced from French cannons captured during the Napoleonic Wars. It was unveiled on 18 June 1844, the anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo, in the presence of the King of Saxony.\nBetween the Wellington statue and the exchange steps is the London Troops Memorial commemorating the dead of military units associated with the City and County of London during the First World War. Designed by Sir Aston Webb, the monument is flanked by two bronze statues of soldiers and surmounted by a lion, all sculpted by Alfred Drury. It was unveiled on 12 November 1920 in the presence of the Duke of York, later King George VI.\n\n\n=== The Gresham Grasshopper ===\n\nThe golden Gresham Grasshopper is the Royal Exchange's weathervane and was the crest of the founder, Sir Thomas Gresham. According to legend, a grasshopper's chirps once led to the discovery of a foundling, who became the first of the house of Gresham and the ancestor of Sir Thomas Gresham.  The Grasshopper weathervane was rescued from the 1838 fire and is 11 feet (3.4 m) long. It stands 177 feet (54 m) above street level on a clock tower which has a clock by Edward John Dent.  A similar grasshopper weathervane on the Faneuil Hall in Boston, Massachusetts was made by Shem Drowne in 1742 and was inspired by the London example.\n\n\n=== Bells ===\nThe tower contains a chime of 15 bells all cast by Charles and George Mears of Whitechapel in 1844, with a mechanism that can play God Save the King, The Roast Beef of Old England, Rule Britannia! and Psalm 104. The combined weight of them is 131 cwt. I qr.\nThe original plan was to have the same number of bells  as before the fire (nine) but was increased to 15 at the suggestion of Edward John Dent, who, having visited Brussels to obtain information as to the arrangement of carillons, was convinced to recommend that the number so that a greater range of tunes could be played. Professor Taylor advised the committee to increase them to fifteen, which would then allow of playing in three octaves. The largest is also the hour bell, and bears the following inscription Cast for the Royal Exchange in the year of grace 1844; Richard Lambert Jones, Chairman of the Gresham College Committee; Daniel Watney, Master of the Mercers' Company; Ebenezer Trottman, Assistant; William Tite, Architect; Charles and George Mears, founders. The others only bear the words Royal Exchange, 1844.â\n\n\n=== Murals ===\n\nFrom 1892, twenty-four scenes from London's history were painted on the first-floor walls by artists including Sir Frederic Leighton, Sir Frank Brangwyn and Stanhope Forbes. The murals run as a sequence:\n\nWith the outbreak of the Second World War, trading at the Royal Exchange virtually ended. At war's end, the building had survived the Blitz, albeit with some near misses.\n\n\n== Modern use ==\n\nIn 1982 the Royal Exchange was in disrepair â in particular, the glass roof was in danger of collapse. The newly formed London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) was the main tenant, using the courtyard for the trading floor, all done without touching the framework of the original building. Liffe moved to Cannon Bridge in 1991.\nIn 2001 the Royal Exchange (interiors and courtyard) was once again extensively remodelled, this time by architects Aukett Fitzroy Robinson. The works involved the restoration of the fabric of the building, a two floor office extension and replacement of the roof above the courtyard.\nIn a lane by the eastern entrance to the Royal Exchange, stand two statues: one of Paul Julius Reuter who founded his news agency there, and one of George Peabody who founded the Peabody Trust and a business which became J.P. Morgan & Co.\nIn 2013 a lease of Royal Exchange was sold by Anglo Irish Bank to Oxford Properties, a Canadian property company. It had been announced that the site would be sold with a 104-year lease. Oxford Properties Group, a division of the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, bought the retail centre for a reported Â£86.5 million. In October 2022, Ardent UK acquired the retail element of the Exchange from Oxford Properties Group for around Â£50 million.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSt Bartholomew-by-the-Exchange\nLondon Troops War Memorial, located outside the Exchange\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nWalter Thornbury.

    "wikipediaText": "St Botolph without Aldersgate (also known as St Botolph's, Aldersgate) is a Church of England church in London dedicated to St Botolph. It was built just outside Aldersgate, one of the gates on London's wall, in the City of London.\nThe church, located on Aldersgate Street, is of medieval origin. The church survived the Great Fire of London with only minor damage but subsequently fell into disrepair and was rebuilt in 1788â91. The church is renowned for its beautiful interior and historic organ. It is used by the London City Presbyterian Church, a congregation of the Free Church of Scotland.\n\n\n== Dedication ==\nThe church was dedicated to Saint Botolph, or Botwulf, a 7th-century East Anglian abbot and saint.\nBy the end of the 11th century, Botolph was regarded as the patron saint of boundaries and, by extension, trade, and travel. The veneration of Botolph was most pronounced before the legend of St Christopher became popular amongst travellers.\nThere were four churches in London dedicated to Botolph, three outside the city gates at Aldersgate, St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate, and St Botolph's Aldgate. A fourth, St Botolph Billingsgate, was near the waterfront wharves and London Bridge. St Botolph Billingsgate was destroyed by fire in 1666 and not rebuilt. The location of these churches at the edge of London reflects all three aspects of Botolph's patronage.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Medieval church ===\nThe church was founded before 1291. The earliest recorded rector was John de Steventon in 1333. The living was originally in the possession of St. Martin's-le-Grand, but on the dissolution of the priory, King Henry VIII granted it to the bishop of the newly founded Diocese of Westminster. The patronage eventually passed to the dean and chapter of Westminster Abbey.\nDuring the Middle Ages, there was a hospital for the poor outside Aldersgate. A Cluniac foundation, it was suppressed by King Henry V as an alien house, and its lands and goods were granted to the parish of St Botolph.\nThe Gothic-style medieval church was divided into aisles and a nave by arcades. There were three gables at the east end. In 1627, the steeple was rebuilt in Portland stone with battlements and a turret, and the rest of the church was repaired. Many of the pews were replaced, and a new clock and dial were installed. The improvements cost, in total, Â£415. The medieval church was 78 feet (24 m) long and 51 feet (16 m) wide. The 17th-century steeple was about 65 feet (20 m) high and contained six bells. In an account published in 1773, the church is described as having galleries on the north and west sides, oak pews, and a carved oak pulpit.\n\n\n=== Eighteenth-century rebuilding ===\n\nThe church escaped the Great Fire of London with only minor damage, but, having become unsafe, was demolished and rebuilt in its present form in 1788â1791 under the supervision of Nathaniel Wright, surveyor to the north district of the City of London. The new church was built of brick, with a low square bell tower at the west end constructed on the remains of its stone predecessor.\nThe plain exterior is in contrast to what John Betjeman called an \"exalting\" succession of features inside. The interior has wooden galleries supported on square panelled columns, a semi-circular apse with a half dome, a highly decorated plasterwork ceiling, and, at the east end the only 18th century stained glass window in the City of London, a depiction of The Agony in the Garden painted by James Pearson. The stained glass in the aisles is partly Victorian, and partly from the 1940s. Some monuments were preserved from the old church, including the tomb of Anne Packington, who died in 1563. The organ, in a gallery at the west end, is by Samuel Green and dates from 1788.\nThe east faÃ§ade, towards Aldersgate Street, is a screen wall, erected in 1831 and executed in Roman cement, with a pediment and four attached Ionic columns standing on a high plinth, with a Venetian window between them.\nThe church underwent several restorations during the 19th and 20th centuries, and many of the furnishings are from the late 19th century. \n\n\n=== Twentieth and twenty-first centuries ===\nIn the mid-1980s, the church was restored by Caroe & Partners. Work on the east front was completed in 2008.\nIn March 2023, after the Church of England's General Synod approved the principle of blessings for same-sex couples, the guild vicar of St Botolph's was announced as \"acting area dean\" of a new \"deanery chapter\", separate from the official diocesan structures, for clergy who felt \"compelled to resist all episcopal leadership from the House of Bishops\". This move was described by the Diocese of London as a \"unilateral move\" with \"no legal substance\", and by the Church Times as \"schismatic\".\n\n\n== Churchyard ==\n\nSt Botolph's churchyard was combined with those of St Leonard, Foster Lane, and Christchurch, Newgate Street, into Postman's Park in 1880, and this now contains the Watts Memorial to Historic Self-Sacrifice, commemorating civilian Londoners who died heroic deaths.\nThe church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.\n\n\n== Current use ==\nAs a Guild Church, the church does not have a parish or Sunday services but holds lunchtime services during the week.\nOn Sundays, the London City Presbyterian Church uses the building. It is also the rehearsal venue for several orchestras.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nChurch Website\nLondon City Presbyterian Church"

    "wikipediaText": "Bevis Marks Synagogue, officially Qahal Kadosh Sha'ar ha-Shamayim (Hebrew: ×§Ö¸×Ö¸× ×§Ö¸××Ö¹×©× ×©Ö·××¢Ö·×¨ ×Ö·×©Ö¸××Ö·×Ö´×, lit.â'Holy Congregation Gate of Heaven'), is an Orthodox Jewish congregation and synagogue, located off Bevis Marks, Aldgate, in the City of London, England, in the United Kingdom. The congregation is affiliated to London's historic Spanish and Portuguese Jewish community and worships in the Sephardic rite.\nBuilt in 1701, the Grade I listed building is the oldest synagogue in the United Kingdom in continuous use. It is the only synagogue building in Europe that has continuously held regular services for more than 320 years.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Construction ===\nThe origins of the community date from an influx to London of crypto-Jews, or so called Marranos, from Spain and Portugal, mostly via the growing Sephardi Jewish community in Amsterdam, in the early seventeenth century. These Jews began practising their religion openly once it became possible to do so through Jewish resettlement in England under the rule of Oliver Cromwell.\nServices at a small synagogue in Creechurch Lane began in 1657, and the congregation also secured land for its own cemetery in Mile End (the Velho Cemetery). In 1663, it was visited on the festival of Simchat Torah by the diarist Samuel Pepys, who recorded his impressions of the service. In 1698 Rabbi David Nieto took spiritual charge of the congregation of \"Spanish and Portuguese Jews\" (Sephardim).\nA considerable influx of Jews made it necessary to obtain more commodious quarters. Accordingly, a committee was appointed, consisting of AntÃ³nio Gomes Serra, Menasseh Mendes, Isaac Israel de Sequeira alias Alfonso Rodrigues, Manuel Nunez Miranda, Andrea Lopez, and PontaleÃ£o Rodriguez. It investigated matters for nearly a year and, on 12 February 1699, signed a contract with Joseph Avis, a Quaker, for the construction of a building to cost Â£2,650. According to legend, Avis declined to collect his full fee, on the ground that it was wrong to profit from building a house of God. Also unsubstantiated is the story that a timber was donated by the then Princess Anne for the roof of the synagogue. On 24 June 1699, the committee leased from Sir Thomas and Lady Pointz (also known as Littleton) a tract of land at Plough Yard, in Bevis Marks, for 61 years, with the option of renewal for a further 38 years, at Â£120 a year.\nThe structure was completed and dedicated in September 1701. The interior decor and furnishing and layout of the synagogue reflect the influence of the great Portuguese Synagogue of Amsterdam of 1675. It has been claimed that the design was also influenced by Christopher Wren, the architect of the nearby St Paul's Cathedral. The roof was destroyed by fire in 1738 and repaired in 1749.  During the London Blitz the synagogue's silver, records and fittings were removed to a place of safety; the synagogue suffered only minor damage. The synagogue suffered some collateral damage from the IRA in 1992 and the 1993 Bishopsgate bombing, but this was restored. The essential original structure of the building thus remains today.\nIn 1747 Benjamin Mendes da Costa bought the lease of the ground on which the building stood, and presented it to the congregation, vesting the deeds in the names of a committee consisting of Gabriel Lopez de Britto, David Aboab Ozorio, Moses Gomes Serra, David Franco, Joseph Jessurun Rodriguez, and Moses Mendes da Costa.\nThe community saw a significant influx of crypto-Jews from Portugal fleeing the inquisition during the seventeenth and eighteenth century. Marriage and circumcision records record couples as \"Vindos de Portugal,\" or more rarely \"Vindos de Espanha,\" for the purpose of reconsecrating their vows now they were free to practice Judaism openly or undertaking an adult circumcision. Alongside migration from Sephardi centres such as Amsterdam and Livorno there was a steady influx of refugees from Portugal up until around 1735, after which it diminished, with some of the last recorded arrivals from Portugal as late as 1790. Records show arrivals escaping principally from major cities such as Lisbon or Porto and the remote borderland region from Spain, such as from Celorico da Beira, Guarda, Braganza or Belmonte. As a result of this migration the sermon at Bevis Marks took place in Portuguese until as late as 1833 when they switched to English.\n\n\n=== Influence ===\nFor Sephardic Jews, the Bevis Marks Synagogue was a religious centre of the Anglo-Jewish world for more than a century, and served as a clearing-house for congregational and individual Jewish problems all over the world. These included the appeal of Jews in Jamaica for a reduction in taxation (1736), the internecine quarrel among Jews in Barbados (1753), and the aiding of seven-year-old Moses de Paz, who escaped from Gibraltar in 1777 to avoid a forced conversion to Christianity. The congregation came to the aid of the Jewish community in Ireland by donating funds to build a wall around the Ballybough Cemetery and providing an agent to oversee the works. The deeds for the cemetery were then lodged at Bevis Marks Synagogue. Through the actions of the leading synagogue member Moses Montefiore the synagogue was also involved in the 19th century in the Damascus Affair and the Mortara Affair, two events provoking much international discussion of Jewish rights and reputation. It was part of the inspiration for Jacob Sassoon's Ohel Rachel Synagogue in Shanghai, the largest synagogue in the Far East.\nAmongst the Chief Rabbis of the Anglo-Sephardic Community (Hahamim) who have served at Bevis Marks have been Daniel Nieto (1654â1728), Benjamin Artom (1835â1879), Abraham Haliva (Halua) (1791-1853) and Moses Gaster (1856â1939). Amongst other notable members of the synagogue's congregation have been the boxer Daniel Mendoza, and Isaac D'Israeli (father of Benjamin Disraeli), who resigned from the congregation after an argument over synagogue fees.\n\n\n=== Expansion of the community ===\nAs the Spanish and Portuguese Jewish community grew and moved out of the City and East End of London to the West End and the suburbs, members demanded a new synagogue to be built in the West End. When the leadership refused this, some members formed a breakaway synagogue in Burton Street, which later became the West London Synagogue. In 1853 a branch synagogue was opened in Wigmore Street; in 1866 this moved to Bryanston Street, Bayswater. Attendance at Bevis Marks declined so much that in 1886 a move to sell the site was contemplated; a \"Bevis Marks Anti-Demolition League\" was founded, under the auspices of H. Guedalla and A. H. Newman, and the proposed move was abandoned.\nIn 1896 a new synagogue was built at Lauderdale Road, Maida Vale, as successor to the Bryanston Street synagogue. A second satellite congregation was established at 46 Forty Avenue, Wembley during the 1960s.\n\n\n=== Events in the twentieth century ===\nOn 10 April 1992, the synagogue was affected by an IRA terrorist attack on the Baltic Exchange. The bomb was contained in a large white truck and consisted of a fertiliser device wrapped with a detonation cord made from Semtex. The Chairman of Buildings for the Spanish & Portuguese Congregation, Mr Barry Musikant, donning a hard hat and escorted by police, was one of the first people to enter the cordoned area of streets to examine the damage to the synagogue. He, with the agreement of the insurance company, put in place a programme of repair which lasted fifteen weeks, but enabled the building to be restored before his daughter's wedding.\nThe following year the synagogue was also affected by an attack on Bishopsgate. Nearly Â£200,000 was raised by donation to help with the renovations to return it to its former glory.\nIn June 2019, it was awarded Â£2.7m by the National Lottery for conservation work and to cover half the costs of building a new religious and cultural centre.\nIn early 2021, it received Â£497,000 from the Government's Culture Recovery Fund \"to protect its collection of significant objects and illuminate the history of the site.\"\nIn 2020 and 2021 there was considerable opposition to planning applications for two nearby skyscrapers which would cut off natural light to the synagogue, threatening its ongoing use for daily services. The community had said the historic synagogue faces a closure threat as the loss of light would render services \"almost impossible.\". Plans to build both tower blocks were ultimately denied by City of London councillors. In 2023, the Creechurch Conservation Area was approved, which should protect Bevis Marks and Grade II* St Botolphâs-without-Aldgate from development.\n\n\n== Features ==\n\nA prominent feature of the synagogue is the Renaissance-style ark (containing the Torah scrolls) located at the centre of the Eastern wall of the building. It resembles in design the reredos of the churches of the same period. Painted to look as though it is made of coloured Italian marble, it is in fact made entirely of oak. The architectural critic Ian Nairn in his book Nairn's London described the synagogue as defined by a \"great luminous room, compassionate light streaming in through big clear glass windows.\"\nSeven hanging brass candelabra symbolise the seven days of the week, the largest of which â hanging in the centre of the synagogue â represents the Sabbath. This central candelabrum was donated by the community of the Great Synagogue of Amsterdam. The candles are still lit today for weddings and the Jewish Festivals. The rest of the year the Synagogue is lit by the electric lights added in 1928. The ner tamid (sanctuary lamp) is of silver and dates from 1876.\nTwelve pillars, symbolising the twelve tribes of Israel, support the women's gallery.\nThe synagogue contains benches running parallel to the side walls and facing inward, leaving two aisles for the procession with the Torah scrolls. In addition, backless benches at the rear of the synagogue, taken from the original synagogue at Creechurch Lane, date from 1657 and are still regularly used.\nA number of seats in the synagogue are roped off as they belong or have belonged to notable people within the community. Two seats were reserved for the most senior officials of the congregation's publishing arm, Heshaim. A third seat, fitted with a footstool, (the seat nearest the Ark on the central row of the left half of the benches) is also withheld as it belonged to Moses Montefiore. It is now only ever occupied by very senior dignitaries as a particular honour. In 2001 Prince Charles used the seat during the synagogue's tercentenary service. Prime Minister Tony Blair used it for the service celebrating the 350th anniversary of the re-settlement of the Jews in Great Britain in 2006, when the Chief Rabbi of the United Synagogue Sir Jonathan Sacks and the Lord Mayor of London were also present.\nThe synagogue retains notable historical records, including community circumcision and marriage records dating back to 1679.\n\n\n== The modern synagogue ==\n\nOn Friday 13 November 1998, Peter, Lord Levene of Portsoken, became the eighth Jewish Lord Mayor of London. An Ashkenazi Jew by birth, Lord Levene's first public act was to walk, with a retinue, from his official residence (Mansion House) to Bevis Marks Synagogue, for the Sabbath Eve service. This was repeated on Friday 12 November 2010 by the then Lord Mayor Michael Bear.\nToday the Spanish and Portuguese descendant community in London operates three synagogues: Bevis Marks, Lauderdale Road (which is the community's administrative headquarters) and a smaller synagogue in Wembley. The community's sheltered housing scheme Harris Court and old-age home Edinburgh House are also located in Wembley. A number of other Sephardic synagogues in Britain have associated status. Bevis Marks Synagogue remains the flagship synagogue of the British Sephardic Jewish community. Daily services are held and the synagogue is frequently a venue for weddings and other celebrations.\nSince August 2015, the rabbi of Bevis Marks is Shalom Morris, an American of Ashkenazi descent. He is a great-grandson of Rabbi Eliezer Silver. King Charles is a patron of the synagogue heading a 2019 conservation appeal for funds to turn it into a heritage centre.\nIt is a Grade 1 listed historic monument.\nIn 2018, the synagogue rescinded its objections to a proposed development after the architects amended the plans and the developers made a donation to the synagogue. The Jewish Chronicle reported that some congregants were unhappy with decision and felt the leadership had lacked ethics.\n\n\n== Threat of development ==\nIn September 2021, it emerged that developers planned to build 21-storey and 48-storey buildings right next to the synagogue. It is claimed this would block natural light from the building for all but one hour a day. The synagogue is currently only lit by up to 240 candles and some electric lighting which was installed in 1928. A campaign has been launched to block the development with the Corporation of London saying no decision has been made. It is reported to have received 1,500 letters of objection. The alarm was raised by an article in The New York Times ahead of reporting by most of the British press. Members of the London Jewish community took to social media on the eve of Yom Kippur to draw attention to the threat to the synagogue including writer Simon Sebag-Montefiore and journalists Jonathan Freedland and Ben Judah.\nAccording to The New York Times, a report commissioned by the developers claims that the building would have no impact on the amount of natural light the synagogue receives.\n\n\n== Associated people ==\n\nAby Belasco, English bare-knuckle boxer\nIsaac D'Israeli (1766â1848), writer, scholar and man of letters\nJoseph Dweck\nDaniel Mendoza, English boxing champion\nSir Moses Montefiore\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHistory of the Jews in England\nList of synagogues in the United Kingdom\nOldest synagogues in the United Kingdom\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBarnett, Richard D; Levy, Abraham (1998).The Bevis Marks Synagogue, London: The Society of Heshaim.

    "wikipediaText": "All Saints' Church is a Church of England parish church in West Dulwich, South London. It is a red brick building designed in a Gothic Revival style by George Fellowes Prynne and built 1888â91. It is Grade I listed.\n\n\n== Parish ==\nAll Saints' parish was formed from the western part of the parish of St Luke's, West Norwood and also included a detached part of the parish of St Leonard's Church, Streatham. The area that became All Saintsâ parish was largely rural until West Dulwich railway station was opened in 1863. The decades after then were marked by an upsurge in residential development, a large proportion of the new houses being on a substantial scale. In the 1880s, a temporary iron church was erected in Rosendale Road. This was replaced by a permanent structure that was consecrated on 13 November 1897.\nThe 1901 Census recorded the parish's population as 3,665. In the following year it was served by one clergyman and attendance at its services (morning and evening combined) represented 37.3% of the parochial population.\nBased on statistics from UK censuses, the Diocese of Southwark estimates the population of All Saintsâ parish was 5,700 in 2001 and 6,400 in 2011.\n\n\n== Building ==\n\nThe church was designed by George Fellowes Prynne, a pupil of George Edmund Street. It stands on a site that slopes dramatically down from Lovelace Road to Rosendale Road. The east end of the church is lofty and the whole church, with the exception of the incomplete west bay, is situated over crypt spaces, which are extensively used by the wider community. The northeast corner of the building has four storeys of accommodation. An enclosed staircase rises to church floor level across the east elevation.\nThe building is vast in scale even though incomplete. The nave was intended to be three bays longer with an apsidal western baptistery. A flÃ¨che was intended over the chancel arch, flanked by a tall slender tower. Only the base of the flÃ¨che exists and the present bell turret by JBS Comper of 1952 is a modest substitute.\nThe church is brick-built with stone dressings and steep-pitched slated roofs. The aisles have individual double-pitched roofs with deep valley gutters alongside the nave's clerestory. There is a four-bay nave, the west bay being incomplete with no clerestory and what was intended to be a temporary slated gable end. It is flanked by narrow aisles and porches (now used for other purposes). The nave is flanked by the Lady Chapel in the north aisle and All Souls' Chapel in the south aisle. The apsidal chancel is enclosed by a narrow ambulatory. To the north the Lady Chapel has its own arcaded chancel with ambulatory. To the south of the chancel the space is occupied by the organ chamber and vestries.\nIn June 1944 a V-1 flying bomb exploded near the church, shattering the stained glass windows and damaging the roof. Services continued in the crypt until the church was restored after the war.\nOn 9 June 2000 fire destroyed the building's interior. Restoration work was completed in April 2006, providing the western end of the church with a modern entrance that contrasts with the Gothic architecture of the remainder of the building. The church's organ was also destroyed in the fire. In the summer of 2011 a 1969 organ, previously in the chapel at St Paul's School in Barnes, was installed at All Saints.\n\n\n== Other uses ==\nThe church is the home of the Lambeth Orchestra and the Dulwich Symphony Orchestra. After the restoration, a private nursery was installed in the basement.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nPevsner, Nikolaus (1952). London. The Buildings of England.

    "wikipediaText": "St Dunstan's, Stepney, is an Anglican church which stands on a site that has been used for Christian worship for over a thousand years. It is located in Stepney High Street, in Stepney, London Borough of Tower Hamlets.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn about AD 952, Dunstan, the Bishop of London â who was also Lord of the manor of Stepney â replaced the existing wooden structure with a new church (probably including stone elements) dedicated to All the Saints. In 1029, when Dunstan was canonised, the church was rededicated to St Dunstan and All Saints, a dedication it has retained. Like many subsequent Bishops, Dunstan may have lived in the Manor of Stepney, perhaps at the Bishops Wood residence.\nDunstan is likely to have had a very 'hands on' approach to building the church. There are so many legends regarding Dunstan, such as those relating to iron in folklore, that some historic accounts are disregarded as ahistorical; such as those describing Dunstan physically moving a whole church so that it better aligns with the traditional East-West axis.\nDunstan is recorded as doing this at Mayfield in the East Sussex Weald, and there is every chance he did similar at Stepney. This is entirely plausible as 10th century churches were typically formed from a small lightweight timber frame that was placed in a pre-dug trench. It is realistic that Dunstan, especially if aided by local builders, adjusted the alignment of the church structure within the trenches with his shoulder. Once the structure was correctly aligned, the trench could be filled in and the gaps in the timber framework filled with wattle and daub.\nThe church is known as \"The Mother Church of the East End\" as the parish covered most of what would become inner East London, before population growth led to the creation of a large number of daughter parishes. This fission started in the fourteenth century or before.  Some of the earliest other churches built in the parish were Whitechapel and Bow; the former became an independent parish at an early date, while the latter was long a chapel of ease.\nThe existing building is the third on the site and was built of Kentish ragstone mainly in the fifteenth century (although the chancel dates from 200 years earlier).  A porch and octagonal parish room were added in 1872 by Arthur Shean Newman and Arthur Billing. The church was restored extensively in 1899 by Cutts and Cutts, at a cost of Â£5,600.  The vestries and some of the main building were destroyed by fire on 12 October 1901, including the organ which had carvings by Grinling Gibbons.  The restoration (again by Cutts and Cutts) cost Â£7,084, and the church was re-opened in June 1902 by the Bishop of Stepney (at that time Cosmo Gordon Lang). There was war-time damage, which was restored by Cyril Wontner-Smith. The church is Grade I listed\n\n\n=== Bells ===\nA ring of ten bells, tuned to C#, hangs in the belfry. The bells were cast at the local Whitechapel Bell Foundry founded in 1570. Until its closure in 2017, the foundry was the last major survivor of an East End metalworking heritage going back to at least the 1300âs, and whose largest expression was the nearby Thames Ironworks at Blackwall and Canning Town.\nOf the ten, the seven oldest bells of these were cast in 1806.  The bells were re-hung in 1899. The heaviest bell weighs 28Â¾ hundredweight.  Three were recast in 1952 when repairs were made to the tower. The bells are mentioned in the nursery rhyme Oranges and Lemons: \"When will that be, say the bells of Stepney.\"\n\n\n=== Interior ===\nA fine triple sedilia (priests' stone seating) is found in the chancel. The rood is late Anglo Saxon. Of note amongst the plate is a cup and paten dated 1559 and a beadle's staff  and verger's wand of 1752.\nThe organ was installed in 1971 by Noel Mander of Mander Organs. It is an 1872 Father Willis instrument built for St Augustine's, Haggerston, and rebuilt by R. Spurden Rutt & Co in 1926. It replaced a 1903 Norman and Beard organ, which is now located at St Edmund the King, Northwood Hills. In turn, that organ replaced the one destroyed in the 1901 fire, which was from 1678 and built by Renatus Harris, and had been rebuilt by Lewis & Co in 1900.\n\n\n=== Churchyard ===\nThe church is surrounded by a churchyard of nearly seven acres (28,000 m2). In 1658 William Greenhill was appointed vicar whilst retaining his position as a preacher at Stepney Meeting House. He held this post for about seven years, till he was ejected immediately after the Restoration in 1660.\nShortly after this, the churchyard was enlarged to cope with the massive number of deaths during the Great Plague of London. In one eighteen-month period 6,583 died, with 154 being buried in one day in September 1665.\nThe church has a long, traditional link with the sea and many sailors were buried here. It was once known as the 'Church of the High Seas'. The graveyard is also where Roger Crab, the 17th-century hermit who lived on a diet solely of herbs, roots, leaves, grass and water, is buried.\nThe churchyard closed to burials in 1854. Between 1885 and 1887 high ground around the church was dug away, and the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association converted it to a public garden, designed by the MPGA's landscape gardener Fanny Wilkinson. The MPGA bore the cost of conversion at Â£3,000. The garden was opened by the Duchess of Leeds in 1887.\nThe railings, piers and gates to the churchyard are Grade II listed; the war memorial in the churchyard is also separately Grade II listed.\n\n\n=== Current activities ===\nThe church continues to be open to visitors and worshippers from all over the world. There is an active congregation who help to continue the life of the church community. As well as the Arbour Centre (a St Dunstan's community project) and the food bank, there is a close connection with two schools: Stepney Greencoat Church of England Primary School and Stepney All Saints School. St Dunstan's also employs a Children and Community Worker funded by the Bishop of London's Mission Fund.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n=== Clergy ===\nJohn Colet (1467 â 1519), educational pioneer and leading Christian humanist.\nRichard Foxe (1448 â 1528), subsequently a bishop and founder of Corpus Christi College, Oxford.\nWilliam Greenhill (1658â65), nonconformist clergyman, independent minister, and member of the Westminster Assembly.\n\n\n=== Baptisms ===\nGodscall Paleologue (1694â?) last heir of the Eastern Roman Empire, born in Wapping and baptised at St Dunstan's in 1694.\n\n\n=== Burials ===\nRoger Crab (1621â1680), promoter of Christian vegetarianism, who lived as a hermit at Bethnal Green.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of churches and cathedrals of London\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSt Dunstan and All Saints', Stepney\nThe Arbour\nSir John Cass and Redcoat Church of England Secondary School\nStepney Greencoat Church of England Primary School"

    "wikipediaText": "St John on Bethnal Green is an early 19th-century church near Bethnal Green, London, and stands on the Green itself. It was constructed in 1826â1828 to the design of the architect Sir John Soane (1753â1837). It is an Anglican church in the Diocese of London. The church is near Bethnal Green tube station, on Bethnal Green Road and Roman Road. It is a Grade I listed building.\nIn 2000, the painter Chris Gollon gained a major commission from the Church of England for fourteen Stations of the Cross paintings for the church. Gollon was a controversial choice, since he is not a practising Christian. In order to carry out the commission, and for consultation on theological matters, he collaborated with Fr Alan Green, rector of the church.\nThe belfry provides an exhibition space for artists.\n\n\n== References =="

    "wikipediaText": "Richmond Palace was a Tudor royal residence on the River Thames in England which stood in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Situated in what was then rural Surrey, it lay upstream and on the opposite bank from the Palace of Westminster, which was located nine miles (14 km) to the north-east. It was erected in about 1501 by Henry VII of England, formerly known as the Earl of Richmond, in honour of which the manor of Sheen had recently been renamed \"Richmond\". Richmond Palace therefore replaced Shene Palace, the latter palace being itself built on the site of an earlier manor house which had been appropriated by Edward I in 1299 and which was subsequently used by his next three direct descendants before it fell into disrepair.\nIn 1500, a year before the construction of the new Richmond Palace began, the name of the town of Sheen, which had grown up around the royal manor, was changed to \"Richmond\" by command of Henry VII. However, both names, Sheen and Richmond, continue to be used, not without scope for confusion. Curiously, today's districts of East Sheen and North Sheen, now under the administrative control of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, were never in ancient times within the manor of Sheen, but were rather developed during the 19th and 20th centuries in parts of the adjoining manor and parish of Mortlake. Richmond remained part of the County of Surrey until April 1, 1965, when it was absorbed by the expansion of Greater London as a result of the London Government Act 1963.\nRichmond Palace was a favourite home of Elizabeth I, who died there in 1603. It remained a residence of the kings and queens of England until the death of Charles I of England in 1649. Within months of his execution, the palace was surveyed by order of the Parliament of England and was sold for Â£13,000. Over the following ten years it was largely demolished, the stones and timbers being re-used as building materials elsewhere. Only vestigial traces now survive, notably the Gate House. (51Â°27'41\"N 0Â°18'33\"W). The site of the former palace is the area between Richmond Green and the River Thames, and some local street names provide clues to existence of the former Palace, including Old Palace Lane and Old Palace Yard.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Norman ===\nHenry I divided the manor of Shene from the royal manor of Kingston and granted it to a Norman knight. The manor-house of Sheen was established by at least 1125.\n\n\n=== 1299 to 1495 ===\nIn 1299 Edward I took his whole court to the manor-house at Sheen, close by the river side. In 1305, he received at Sheen the Commissioners from Scotland to arrange the Scottish civil government.\nThe house returned to royal hands in the reign of Edward II and after his deposition it was held by his wife, Queen Isabella. When the boy-king Edward III came to the throne in 1327, he gave the manor to his mother Isabella. After her death he extended and embellished the manor house and turned it into the first Shene Palace. Edward III died at Shene on 21 June 1377. In 1368 Geoffrey Chaucer served as a yeoman at Sheen.\nRichard II was the first English king to make Sheen his main residence in 1383. He took his bride Anne of Bohemia there. Twelve years later Richard was so distraught at the death of Anne at the age of 28, that he, according to Holinshed, \"caused it [the manor] to be thrown down and defaced; whereas the former kings of this land, being wearied of the citie, used customarily thither to resort as to a place of pleasure, and serving highly to their recreation.\"  For almost 20 years it lay in ruins until Henry V undertook rebuilding work in 1414. The first, pre-Tudor, version of the palace was known as Sheen Palace. It was positioned roughly at 51Â°27â²37â³N 0Â°18â²37â³W, in what is now the garden of Trumpeters' House, between Richmond Green and the River.  In 1414 Henry V also founded a Carthusian monastery there known as  Sheen Priory, adjacent on the N. to the royal residence.\nHenry VI continued the rebuilding in order that the palace might be worthy of the reception of his queen, Margaret of Anjou. Edward IV granted it to his queen Elizabeth Woodville for life.\n\n\n=== Tudor ===\n\n\n==== Henry VII, builder of Richmond Palace ====\n\nIn 1492, a great tournament was held at the palace by Henry VII. On 23 December 1497 a fire destroyed most of the wooden buildings.  Henry rebuilt it and named the new palace Richmond Palace after his title of Earl of Richmond. The earldom was seated at Richmond Castle, Yorkshire, from which it took its name. In 1502, the new palace witnessed the betrothal of Princess Margaret, daughter of Henry VII, to King James IV of Scotland. From this line eventually came the House of Stuart. In 1509 Henry VII died at Richmond Palace.\n\n\n==== The fire of 1497 ====\nAt Christmastide in 1497, a great fire broke out in the king's private chambers, destroying a large portion of the palace. The Milanese ambassador, Raimondo Soncino, witnessed the blaze, and estimated the damage at 60,000 ducats, in modern money about $10 million or Â£7 million. The fire lasted three hours and tore through the rest of the palace, causing hundreds to flee in panic. Hammerbeam roofs of the Middle Ages were a structural necessity as much as they were pretty architecture, as they kept the heavy timbered roofs from caving in; they were the carpenter's equivalent of the stone vaulting found in Gothic cathedrals of the Middle Ages because, as in famous examples like Westminster Hall, they let the architect achieve greater heights with thinner walls, and evenly distributed the lateral weight. In as large a fire as described by Soncino the English oak beams of the great hall, a centrepiece of a royal Christmas, would have stood no chance of remaining upright and intact. They would have been engulfed in flames at a temperature of over 270 Â°C (518 Â°F). Much of the tapestry work of earlier ages was burnt to cinders, and losses included crown jewels and much of the royal wardrobe, including a large amount of cloth of gold, at this time a luxury item only wearable by royalty; and in the case of Sheen Palace it was a feature of the bedding.\nAccounts refer to Henry VII, his mother, Margaret Beaufort,  and his wife, Elizabeth of York, running for their lives, with the King barely making it out in time: one of the corridors nearly collapsed on top of him. As it was the time of the Christmas revels, also present during the disaster were all but one of the royal children, and all under the age of 10: Margaret, Mary, and  a six-year-old Henry VIII, each of them described as being hurried out in the arms of their nursemaids. For Queen Elizabeth, this would have been a horrible blow: records show that as a child in the 1470s this was where she spent much of her childhood; the palace would also have had strong associations with her mother Elizabeth Woodville: Edward IV left Sheen to his wife in his will. Soncino reports all of the events outlined above, and also states in his accounts that the king \"does not attach much importance to this loss. He purposes to build the chapel all in stone, and much finer than before.\"\n\n\n==== The new Richmond Palace ====\nConstruction of the new palace began in 1498. Henry named his creation Richmond Palace, in honour of the title he had held before acceding to the throne which he had inherited from his father: Earl of Richmond. Though the palace did not survive the English Civil War, fragments of the edifice still remain along the bank of the Thames, as does Richmond Park, originally a royal hunting reserve that Henry Tudor and all members of the Tudors and early Stuarts used for their personal entertainment. Henry Tudor built a large and grand palace that became the centre of royal life for many years to come, a very important centre of the court of each Tudor monarch and also James I. Drawings and descriptions of the palace survive, as does the documentation of a 1970s excavation of the grounds; thus posterity has a fairly accurate idea of the contents and features of the building.\nRichmond Palace was largely a building of brick and white stone in the latest styles of the times, with geometric octagonal towers, pepper-pot chimney caps, and ornate weather vanes made of brass. Though it retained the layout of Sheen Palace, it had new additions that would mark the Renaissance: for example, long galleries to display sculpture and portraiture. Henry VII also established a library and a richly appointed chapel. The windows were panelled, built to bring in more light than the tiny slit-like windows of a castle, built for defence.  From its earliest it had inner courtyards designed for leisure, with several portions built for the royal family overlooking a large green. Richmond Palace covered 10 acres (4 ha)  of land and was large and well appointed enough to have its own orchards and walled gardens. It is known that Henry Tudor decorated his home with many gifts he accepted from Italian bankers in Venice, and the evidence for this and the other accoutrements survives in a 17th-century inventory taken of the palace that is now held in The National Archives. The inventory also describes new tapestries he commissioned to replace the ones lost in the fire.\n\n\n==== Henry VIII ====\nLater the same year, Henry VIII celebrated Christmas to Twelfth Night at Richmond with the first of his six wives, Catherine of Aragon. The events were described in Edward Hall's Chronicle. During those celebrations, says Mrs. A. T. Thomson, in her Memoirs of the Court of Henry the Eighth:\n\nOn the night of the Epiphany (1510), a pageant was introduced into the hall at Richmond, representing a hill studded with gold and precious stones, and having on its summit a tree of gold, from which hung roses and pomegranates. From the declivity of the hill descended a lady richly attired, who, with the gentlemen, or, as they were then called, children of honour, danced a morris before the king. On another occasion, in the presence of the court, an artificial forest was drawn in by a lion and an antelope, the hides of which were richly embroidered with golden ornaments; the animals were harnessed with chains of gold, and on each sat a fair damsel in gay apparel. In the midst of the forest, which was thus introduced, appeared a gilded tower, at the end of which stood a youth, holding in his hands a garland of roses, as the prize of valour in a tournament which succeeded the pageant!\"\n\nHenry's son, Henry, Duke of Cornwall, was born there on New Year's Day, 1511, but died on 22 February. Some years later, the King received a present of Hampton Court from Wolsey, and in return the Cardinal received permission to reside at the royal manor of Richmond, where he kept up so much state as to increase the growing ill-feeling against him. When he fell into disfavour he took up his residence at the Lodge in the 'great' park, and subsequently moved to the Priory.\nGeorge Cavendish, the biographer of Cardinal Wolsey, described carved and painted royal heraldic beasts in a garden at Richmond Palace. Wolsey said a dun cow (referring to the Earldom of Richmond) was also found in the heraldry of Thomas Boleyn and was a portent of the relationship of Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII.\nIn August 1531, Richmond became the principal residence of Henry's daughter Mary after Henry separated her from her mother, Catherine. Mary stayed at the palace until December 1533, when she was ordered to Hatfield House to wait on the newly born Princess Elizabeth.\nIn 1540, Henry gave the palace to his fourth wife, Anne of Cleves, as part of her annulment settlement.\n\n\n==== Mary I ====\n\nIn 1554, Mary I married Philip of Spain.  Forty-five years after her mother Catherine of Aragon had spent Christmas at Richmond Palace, they spent their honeymoon there (and at Hampton Court). Later that same year, her sister Elizabeth I was taken to Richmond as a prisoner on her way to Woodstock Palace.\n\n\n==== Elizabeth I ====\nOnce Elizabeth I became queen she spent much of her time at Richmond, as she enjoyed hunting stags in the \"Newe Parke of Richmonde\" (now the Old Deer Park). Elizabeth I died there on 24 March 1603.\n\n\n=== Stuart ===\n\n\n==== James I ====\nKing James I preferred the Palace of Whitehall to Richmond, but his eldest son Prince Henry was able to commission water-works for the garden designed by the French Huguenot, Salomon de Caus, and the Florentine Costantini de' Servi, shortly before his death in 1612. Before he became king, Charles I owned Richmond Palace and started to build his art collection whilst living there. Like Elizabeth I, Charles I enjoyed hunting stags, and in 1637 created a new area for this now known as Richmond Park, renaming Elizabeth's \"Newe Parke\"  the \"Old Deer Park\". There continue to be red deer in Richmond Park today, possibly descendants of the original herd, free from hunting and relatively tame.\n\n\n==== Charles I, the Commonwealth and demolition ====\n\nCharles I gave the palace with the manor to Queen Henrietta Maria, probably in 1626, and it became the home of the royal children. Within months of the execution of the King in 1649, Richmond Palace was surveyed by order of Parliament to see what it could fetch in terms of raw materials, and was sold for Â£13,000. Over the next ten years it was largely demolished, the stones being re-used as building materials.\n\n\n==== Restoration of the monarchy ====\nFollowing the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, the palace and manor were restored to Queen Henrietta Maria (d.1669), the mother of Charles II of England and widow of the beheaded King Charles I, who during the Civil War had lived in exile in France. It was then in a dismantled condition, having suffered much dilapidation during the inter-regnum. The ruined palace was never rebuilt.\n\n\n== Architecture and internal decoration ==\nAll the accounts which have come down to us describe the furniture and decorations of Richmond Palace as superb, exhibiting in tapestries the deeds of kings and heroes.\n\n\n=== Survey of 1649 ===\nThe survey taken in 1649 affords a minute description of the palace. The great hall was 100 ft (30 m) in length, and 40 ft (12 m) in breadth, having a screen at the lower end, over which was \"fayr foot space in the higher end thereof, the pavement of square tile, well lighted and seated; at the north end having a turret, or clock-case, covered with lead, which is a special ornament to this building.\" The prince's lodgings are described as a \"freestone building, three stories high, with fourteen turrets covered with lead,\" being \"a very graceful ornament to the whole house, and perspicuous to the county round about.\" A round tower is mentioned, called the \"Canted Tower,\" with a staircase of 124 steps. The chapel was 96 ft (29 m) long and 40 ft (12 m) broad, with cathedral-seats and pews. Adjoining the prince's garden was an open gallery, 200 ft (61 m) long, over which was a close gallery of similar length. Here was also a royal library. Three pipes supplied the palace with water, one from the white conduit in the new park, another from the conduit in the town fields, and the third from a conduit near the alms-houses in Richmond.\n\n\n=== Archaeology ===\nIn July 1997 the site was investigated as part of series 5 of the Channel 4 programme Time Team which was broadcast in January 1998.\n\n\n=== Lavatory innovation ===\nThis palace was one of the first buildings in history to be equipped with a flushing lavatory, invented by Elizabeth I's godson, Sir John Harington. Henry VIII had earlier installed flushing latrines at Hampton Court.\n\n\n== Richmond Palace today ==\n\nStructures of the former palace that have survived include the Wardrobe, the Trumpeters' House and the Gate House, all three of which are Grade I listed. The Gate House was built in 1501, and was let on a 65-year lease by the Crown Estate Commissioners in 1986. It has five bedrooms.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nRoyal Richmond timeline\nRead a detailed historical record on Richmond Palace\nTrumpeters' House"

    "wikipediaText": "Garrick's Temple to Shakespeare is a small garden folly erected in 1756 on the north bank of the River Thames at Hampton in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. Grade I listed, it was built by the actor David Garrick to honour the playwright William Shakespeare, whose plays Garrick performed to great acclaim throughout his career. During his lifetime Garrick used it to house his extensive collection of Shakespearean relics and for entertaining his family and guests. It passed through a succession of owners until coming into public ownership in the 1930s, but it had fallen into serious disrepair by the end of the 20th century. After a campaign supported by distinguished actors and donations from the National Lottery's \"good causes\" fund, it was restored in the late 1990s and reopened to the public as a museum and memorial to the life and career of Garrick. It is reputedly the world's only shrine to Shakespeare.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe temple is an octagonal domed building with a nod to the Pantheon, Rome, constructed in undecorated brick with a single east-facing entrance. It was built in the Classical style popularised by the Italian architect Palladio with an Ionic portico, four columns wide by three deep, flanking the entrance. Several steps lead up to the portico.  Inside, glazed arched windows reaching to the ground face the river.  A deep curved recess in the west wall provides room for a statue. Outside, a lawn and garden provide views over the Thames to the south.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Construction ===\n\nGarrick built the temple on land adjoining a villa that he had bought in October 1754 to serve as a country retreat. The villa's riverside garden, a plot now known as Garrick's Lawn, was separated from the main property by the road from Kingston upon Thames to Staines. Garrick commissioned the building of an elaborate grotto-tunnel under the road, illuminated by 500 lanterns, to facilitate private access to the lawn from the house.\nAt some point in 1755 he decided to build a summer-house by the riverside which he intended to dedicate to his muse Shakespeare as a \"temple\" to the playwright. The temple's architect is unknown as his decision to build it is not recorded in his own papers. Robert Adam and Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown have both been suggested as possibilities. An \"Ionic Temple\" of similar design stands in the gardens of Chiswick House a few miles away.  This may well have been the inspiration for Garrick's Temple, as Garrick had spent his honeymoon at Chiswick House a few years earlier in the company of his wife's guardians the Burlingtons.\nOn 4 August 1755, his neighbour and friend Horace Walpole wrote to a correspondent: \"I have contracted a sort of intimacy with Garrick, who is my neighbour. He affects to study my taste; I lay it all upon you â he admires you. He is building a graceful temple to Shakespeare: I offered him this motto: Quod spiro et placeo, si placeo tuum est [If I inspire and give pleasure, it is because of you].\" A year later, Walpole wrote in another letter:\n\nHe has built a temple to his master Shakespear [sic], and I am going to adorn the outside, since his modesty would not let me decorate it within, as I proposed, with these mottos:\n\nThe garden in front of the temple was laid out in accordance with Garrick's friend William Hogarth's theory of the Line of Beauty. An S-shaped path ran between flowering shrubs in accordance with the theory's preference for serpentine shapes. Walpole donated a grove of Italian cypresses to plant in the garden. It was widely admired in its time and its idyllic prospect so moved Samuel Johnson that he told Garrick: \"Ah, David, it is the leaving of such places that makes a deathbed so terrible.\"\n\n\n=== Contents ===\n\nThe temple's interior was furnished as a shrine to Shakespeare. It was dominated by a statue of the playwright commissioned by Garrick from the French Huguenot sculptor Louis-FranÃ§ois Roubiliac at a cost of 300 guineas (Â£315, equivalent to approximately Â£32,000 now). Roubiliac chose to model the statue on the Chandos portrait of Shakespeare while Garrick himself is said to have posed for the sculpture. Its appearance is rather more reminiscent of Garrick than Shakespeare; it is said that the actor struck a pose and exclaimed, \"Lo, the Bard of Avon!\" to illustrate how he wanted Shakespeare to be portrayed. The statue's head was not to Garrick's satisfaction, and Roubiliac had to replace it with another, carved from a different type of marble. During Garrick's lifetime the statue was displayed in the temple. On his death it was willed to the British Museum, where it was on display in the King's Library until 1998, when it was moved to the British Library. A copy of the statue, donated by the museum, is currently displayed in the temple.\nGarrick exhibited his collection of Shakespeare relics in the temple, including a chair made from a mulberry tree which had supposedly been planted by Shakespeare in the grounds of New Place, his house at Stratford upon Avon. The chair was designed by Hogarth, according to Walpole, and had a medal of Shakespeare carved into its backrest. The chair survives and is today owned by the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C. Other items on display included various personal effects of Shakespeare such as \"an old leather glove, with pointed fingers and blackened metal embroidery\", a dagger and \"a signet ring with W.S. on it.\" The collection was sold and dispersed on the death of Garrick's widow; he had collected so much Shakespearean memorabilia that it took ten days to auction it all.\n\n\n=== Usage ===\n\nGarrick employed the temple not just as a museum but as a working building. As well as using it as a quiet place to learn his lines and write letters, the actor used it to entertain his wife and guests for afternoon tea and dinner. The painter Johann Zoffany, a protÃ©gÃ© of Garrick, painted a number of scenes of the actor, his wife and their friends on the lawn and in front of the temple. One of his guests, the letter-writer Mrs Delany, described the scene at one such entertainment in a letter of 1770:\n\nWe had an excellent dinner nicely served, and then went over directly into the garden â a piece of irregular ground sloping down to the Thames, very well laid out, and planted for shade and shelter; and an opening to the river which appears beautiful from that spot, and from Shakespeare's Temple at the end of the Improvement, where we drank tea, and where there is a very fine statue of Shakespeare in white marble, and a great chair with a large carved frame, that was Shakespeare's own chair, made for him on some particular occasion, with a medallion fixed in the back.  Many were the relics we saw of the favourite poet.  At six o'clock Lady Weymouth's fine group of children walked into the garden, which added to the agreeableness of the scene.\nHis visitors were encouraged to pay homage to the Bard by writing verses in Shakespeare's honour and placing them at the foot of the statue.  Garrick had the best of them published anonymously in the London journals. Some found this practice cloying; Samuel Foote commented sarcastically that Garrick had \"dedicated a temple to a certain divinity... before whose shrine frequent libations are made, and on whose alter the fat of venison, a viand grateful to this deity, is seen often to smoke.\" Voltaire, too, used the temple as a subject of ridicule in a letter to the AcadÃ©mie franÃ§aise published in 1776. Some of Garrick's contemporaries suspected that, as a rumour had it, the temple was not merely intended for Shakespeare's glorification but for Garrick's own. It was seen as an effort to associate the actor indelibly with the playwright, or even equating the two.\nIn August 1774, the temple and gardens were the centrepiece of Garrick's elaborate silver jubilee celebrations to celebrate 25 years of marriage. The London Chronicle reported:\n\nLast night Mr Garrick gave a splendid entertainment or Fete Champetre at his gardens at Hampton. Signior Torre conducted a most brilliant fire-work; an elegant concert of music was performed; and the company, which consisted of a great number of Nobility and Gentry, expressed the utmost satisfaction on the occasion. The temple of Shakespeare, and gardens, were illuminated with 6000 lamps, and the forge of Vulcan made a splendid appearance.\nGarrick also opened the temple and garden to the public on special occasions. Each May Day, seated on the chair noted by Mrs Delany and accompanied by his wife, he would give the poor children of Hampton money and cakes. A woman who attended one such May Day event later recalled: \"When I was called up, I took my six [children] into the Temple, where Mr Garrick was sitting by the fine bust with great cakes before him; he took down all their names, and then gave a shilling and a piece of plum-cake to every individual one; not even leaving out poor babes in their mothers' arms.\"\n\n\n=== Preservation and restoration ===\n\nThe temple and villa remained in the hands of Garrick's wife until her death in 1822 at the age of 98. It was subsequently bought by her solicitor, Thomas Carr, who preserved it as a monument to Garrick and even erected a statue of him in the temple to replace the Roubiliac Shakespeare. It changed hands several more times until, in 1923, the villa was converted into apartments. The riverside lawn was sold separately along with the temple and was bought by a Paul Glaize, who built a three-storey house alongside the temple. This caused such controversy and public outcry that in 1932 the site was bought by Hampton Urban District Council so that Glaize's Temple House could be demolished. The lawn and temple were subsequently opened to the public. They have remained in public ownership ever since.\nDuring the Second World War the temple was used as a post for Air Raid Precautions wardens. It was given Grade I listed status in September 1952 and became part of a conservation area in the 1960s, when it was used for poetry readings. However, it had become neglected and vandalised by the 1970s. It suffered from wet and dry rot, vibrations from traffic on the busy nearby road had damaged the fabric of the building and thieves had stolen the lead off the roof. Donald Insall Associates, a specialist conservation architectural firm, was commissioned by Richmond upon Thames Council to restore the building at a cost of Â£37,000. The work was carried out by the building firm Gostling and the architect James Lindus Forge. Patrick Baty advised on the paint colours.\nBy the 1990s the temple's condition had deteriorated again and it had suffered heavy vandalism. The Richmond and Twickenham Times reported in 1994 that it was in a state of \"dangerous disrepair\" and had suffered from \"the theft of lead from the roof and graffiti spray-painted on the walls of the Georgian folly.\" Vandals had also hacked away one of the wooden columns supporting the portico. In 1995 a campaign was launched to restore the temple and the garden and put them back into use for cultural purposes. The Heritage Lottery Fund provided Â£70,000 in 1998â99. Other local groups and a campaign led by the actor Clive Francis provided additional funding to carry out restoration work. The restoration fund was also supported by the actors  Sir John Gielgud Sir Peter Hall, Sir Donald Sinden, Richard Briers, Peter O'Toole, Dame Judi Dench, Jeremy Irons and others have subsequently made donations.\nThe restoration work was undertaken by Donald Insall Associates. The temple was reopened to the public in late 1998, and in early 1999 the garden was replanted to replicate its original Georgian appearance. The British Museum provided a copy of Roubiliac's statue of Shakespeare to occupy the vacant niche where the original had once stood. The temple was populated with an exhibition on Garrick's life and career, including copies of portraits by Gainsborough, Reynolds and Zoffany. The project was completed by April 1999.\nToday the temple is managed by Garrick's Temple Partnership, which brings together the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, the Garrick's Temple to Shakespeare Trust, the Temple Trust, the Thames Landscape Strategy and Hampton Riverside Trust. The Garrick's Temple to Shakespeare Trust is chaired by the actor Clive Francis, and Liz Crowther is a member of the Temple Management Committee. The temple is open to the public on Sunday afternoons between April and September. It is used for concerts, annual general meetings and private events, and runs an educational programme for local schoolchildren in conjunction with the nearby Orleans House.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAstoria (recording studio) (neighbour)\nShakespeare's signet ring, a seal ring that may have belonged to William Shakespeare.

It is a remarkably fine apartment and resembles in a lesser\nvein and on a smaller scale, the Great Hall at Hampton Court which was built\nin 1530-35. Sir Francis Carew entertained Queen Elizabeth here for 3 days in\n1599.\nThe interior of the Great Hall (60 ft 8 ins x 52 ft 4 ins) is covered by an early\nC16 arch braced hammer-beam roof of 4 bays with similar trusses in the end walls.\nOn the walls are (1) a trophy of Elizabethan arms and military engines in stone\nor plaster painted to look like bronze, and (2) at the opposite end a coloured\nachievement of arms in similar relief of Sir Nicholas Carew (d 1727) with the\narms of his wife Elizabeth Hackett in pretence.  The walls are lined with stained\nC19 panelling with crenellated top rails, which according to the Victoria County\nHistory covers an old fireplace.  The floor is of white stone paving with black\nmarble squares placed diagonally at the corners; probably circa 1709-10 when\nthe alterations were made to the house; this has now been covered by modern parquet\nfloors.  The room to the South on each floor is constructed within the walls\nof the Tudor house and half a one-light stone window surround and its adjacent\nwalling is said to be visible on opening a cupboard on the 1st floor.  Some of\nthe roofing over this is also old, but it is not of any real interest.\nThe only other feature of interest is an early C18 bolection moulded marble fireplace\nsurround in the South-West ground floor room,  Formerly a wall tablet by H Weekes,\nARA, to the Duke of Cambridge commissioned in 1850 by the Orphanage in his memory\nand brought from their earlier premises.  It bears a profile bust portrait of\nthe Duke and 2 profile full length portraits of girl orphans in uniform.\nC19 casing to Great Hall in a Gothic style in red brick with stone dressings\nand tile roofs.  Main part of east elevation of 2 storeys, 6 bays, each bay separated\nby a buttress.  Crenellated parapet.  Tall 2-light Gothic windows above; below\n2-light windows in rectangular frames.  At either end a gabled projection of\n2 storeys, 2 window bays.  Casing to west front of Great Hall in similar style\nbut with lean-to loggia against ground floor of hall; 2-light square headed glazed\nopenings.  5 window bays with tall brick tower to centre bay; 2 tall windows\nabove lst floor of tower; moulded band with gargoyles; gables over each face;\nclock in west face; bell-cote.

Totalling 54 acres and 2,600 ft long with an original impounded\nsouth of 23 ft, the quay wall are of sophisticated brickwork having a profile and counterfort buttresses, on a gravel bed. The ashlar granite copings\nhave largely been renewed or concealed by jetties.  The locks to the Blackwall\nBasin were enlarged later in the C19 but see West Ferry Road for the\nLimehouse Entrance lock to the former City Canal subsequently in the 1860s\nenlarged as the present South Dock.  Expenditure on works from 1800 to 1806\namounted to the vast sum of ?l.1 million.  These docks with Nos 1 and 2 warehouses (qv) are now the only surviving examples of the first intensive period of London dock construction: 1800-10. \nListing NGR: TQ3757380490\n        \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n    \n        Legacy\n    \n    \n        The contents of this record have been generated from a legacy data system.\n    \n    \n        \n            Legacy System number:\n            \n                206451\n            \n        \n        \n            Legacy System:\n            \n                LBS\n            \n        \n    \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n\n\n\n                    \n                        \n\n\n    \n        Legal\n    \n\n\n    \n        This building is listed under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as amended for its special architectural or historic interest.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n\n            \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n            \n                Map\n            \n            \n                This map is for quick reference purposes only and may not be to scale.

    "wikipediaText": "Tobacco Dock is a Grade I listed warehouse located at Wapping, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. Part of the London Docks in the East End of London, it was designed by Scottish civil engineer and architect John Rennie, the warehouse was completed in 1812 and primarily served as a store for imported tobacco, hence the name. During the early 20th century, economic activity in the area fluctuated due to World War I and World War II, and both London Docks and nearby St Katharine Docks had closed by 1969.\nAfter the London Docklands ceased seaborne trade, the warehouse and surrounding areas fell into dereliction until it was turned into a shopping centre which opened in 1989. However, due to the early 1990s recession, it was forced to close two years later. In 2003 English Heritage placed it on its \"at risk\" register, preventing many developers from attempting a rejuvenation of the former London Docklands site. For two decades Tobacco Dock stood largely empty; it was used as a barracks for military personnel providing security to the 2012 London Olympics.\nIn 2012 the company Tobacco Dock Ltd launched the building as an events and conferencing space for up to 10,000 people. It also houses offices and co-working spaces operated by Tobacco Dock Venue Ltd, although the site and building itself are owned by Kuwaiti Real Estate Group Al Mubarakia Ltd.\n\n\n== History and usage ==\nThe London Dock Company was initially established in January 1796 by a group of merchants, shippers and bankers and upon the drawing up of plans for The London Docks the company negotiated a 21-year monopoly on the management of vessels carrying rice, tobacco, wine and brandy. This excluded those coming from the East and West Indies, which were managed by the East India Trading Company.\n\nThe vaults beneath the tobacco warehouses resembled the crypts of a Gothic cathedral, \"with chamfered granite columns under finely-executed brick groins, connected with a 20-acre \"subterranean city\" for the storage of wines and spirits, where they could mature at a stable temperature of 15.5 Â°C\".\n\nThere was storage for around 8 million gallons of wine and on 30 June 1849 the Dock contained 14,783 pipes of port; 13,107 hogsheads of sherry; 64 pipes of French wine; 796 pipes of Cap wine; 7607 cases of wine, containing 19,140 dozen; 10,113 hogsheads of brandy; and 3642 pipes of rum.\nIn Victorian England it was possible to obtain a permit from The London Dock Company to visit the vaults, although women were not admitted after 1pm and wine merchants provided visitors with tasting orders that allowed them to sample the various wines, brandies, spirits and ports that were in storage. Now only four of the original vaults survive. \"Later, from the 1860s, the ground floor of the warehouse was predominantly used for wool, furs and skins â hence the name \"Skin Floor\" â and cork and molasses\". In his ''Being Notes of Common Life and Pastoral Work in Saint James's, Westminster and in Saint Georges'-in-the-East'', the Reverend Harry Jones, Rector of Saint Georges'-in-the-East (Smith Elder & Co, London 1875) noted that an army of about 300 cats were \"employed\" to control the number of rats in the Dock.\n\nThe Docks abound with rats, and an army of about three hundred cats is employed to keep them down. Besides these you find dogs. Some little time ago I came on a famous one with her litter of puppies, close by the 'bowl' of our Queen's Pipe. Her owner volunteered a record of some of her performances in the rat-killing way, and fondly enumerated the number she had slain. But, like a true Englishman, he had his grievance. I learned that the Company does not pay for or provide the keep of the dogs, while it seems to be at the expense of extensive orders for cat's meat. I should have thought dogs would have needed food, while cats could have kept themselves.\n\nThe former street side entrance to The London Docks was from Ratcliffe Highway which is now known simply as The Highway; due to it being a Roman road it was well suited for its usage as a trading centre for the port. Although it was rather notorious for prostitution and other nefarious activities as many of the sailors coming in from their long voyages were single men looking for drink and a woman, with plenty of cash to spare and the taverns and brothels along its length provided for their every need. In 1600 John Stow described it as \"a continual street, or filthy straight passage, with alleys of small tenements or cottages builded, inhabited by sailors and victualers\". One such shop along Ratcliffe Highway was German-born wild animal trader Charles Jamrach's \"Jamrach's Animal Emporium\", which also served as a museum.\nJamrach also owned a menagerie in Betts Street and a warehouse in Old Gravel Lane, Southwark; he was a leading importer, breeder and exporter of animals, selling to noblemen, zoos, menageries and circus owners, and buying from ships docking in London and nearby ports, with agents in other major British ports, including Liverpool, Southampton and Plymouth, and also in continental Europe. In 1857 a wild Bengal tiger escaped from its box as it was waiting to be loaded into its new den and carried off a young boy of around nine years of age who tried to stroke it. Upon his command, one of Jamrach's men brought a crowbar and struck the tiger three times until it released the boy. However, it was only stunned and jumped up again once Jamrach pried the boy from its jaws; so, after a final blow Jamrach and his men managed to return the tiger to its den largely unharmed. \nHospital reports showed that the boy was unharmed yet Jamrach offered his father, a tailor, Â£50 in compensation \"for the alarm he had sustained\". Despite this he sued Jamrach for damages which ended up costing Â£300: Â£60 for the father and Â£240 for the lawyers. Jamrach eventually sold the tiger to Mr. Edmonds of Wombell's menagerie for Â£300, who made a fortune by exhibiting it as the tiger that swallowed a child.\nAt the north entrance of Tobacco Dock there now stands a 7-foot-tall (2.1 m) bronze sculpture of a boy standing in front of a tiger to commemorate the incident..\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Site and plan ===\n\nThe name Tobacco Dock comes from its original use as a warehouse built to store tobacco and other valuable imports from the New World. It made up part of The London Docks for which plans were first proposed in 1800 when the London Dock Act was passed authorising the building of a wet dock in Wapping, the initial cost of the docks was Â£4 million. While the majority of the wet dock was built on drainage fields, many houses as well as the former site of the Raine's Foundation School were demolished to make way for warehouses, offices and quays, one of such warehouses is now Tobacco Dock. This resulted in many people being made homeless due to a compulsory purchase order being made for the land by the London Dock Company. Part of the St. John's Churchyard was also used in the creation of the docks, resulting in a need to rebury some of the dead. In Harper's New Monthly Magazine it was written that The London Docks were made up of more than 100 acres with space for more than 500 ships, and warehouses capable of holding 234,000 tons of goods, with the capital of the company alone exceeding Â£4 million.\n\n\n=== Style ===\nAlthough the homes built for dock staff on the Pier Head are a classic example of late Georgian architecture, most specifically of the Regency era, the dock itself deterred would be thieves with its prison-like design.\n\n\n=== Features ===\nOne of the most notable features of Tobacco Dock that can be seen from the outside are the high walls surrounding the whole structure, costing Â£65,000. They are a result of the strict storage and import laws relating to tobacco and liquor, which were (and still are) subjected to excise duty; hence, it was required that they be kept in bonded warehouses with strict security measures. Another reason for the virtually impenetrable walls was defence; piracy was rampant in the 19th century and professional bandits such as The River Pirates, the Night Plunderers, the Scuffle-Hunters and the Mud Larks patrolled the waters and ports in search of a victim. Due to massive congestion on the river there was often around 1,800 boats moored in a space meant for 500.\nThis thievery may have influenced the decision to hire Daniel Asher Alexander - who was the principal architect of both Dartmoor Prison and Maidstone Prison - to design The London Dock, as well as act as the principle surveyor.\n\"The Great Tobacco Warehouse\" was also known as the Queen's Warehouse; hence, the furnace at its centre earned the moniker of \"The Queen's Tobacco Pipe\" as it was used to burn defective tobacco and other unusable goods as well as those which had not had their duty paid. John Timbs' Curiosities of London (1867) records:\n\nNear the north-east corner of the Queen's Warehouse, a guide-post, inscribed 'To the Kiln', directs you to 'the Queen's Pipe', or chimney of the furnace; on the door of the latter and of the room are painted the crown-royal and VR. In this kiln are burnt all such goods as do not fetch the amount of their duties and the Customs' charges: tea, having once set the chimney of the kiln on fire, is rarely burnt; and the wine and spirits are emptied into the Docks. The huge mass of fire in the furnace is fed night and day with condemned goods: on one occasion, 900 Austrian mutton-hams were burnt; on another, 45,000 pairs of French gloves; and silks and satins, tobacco and cigars, are here consumed in vast quantities: the ashes being sold by the ton as manure, for killing insects, and to soap-boilers and chemical manufacturers. Nails and other pieces of iron, sifted from the ashes, are prized for their toughness in making gun-barrels; gold and silver, the remains of plate, watches, and jewellery thrown into the furnace, are also found in the ashes.\n\n\n== Redevelopment ==\n\nIn 1990 the structure was converted into a shopping centre at a cost of Â£47 million; it was the intention of the developers to create the \"Covent Garden of the East End\", however the scheme was unsuccessful and it went into administration. This is likely due, in part, to the fact that Tobacco Dock is not in a major retail area and has only moderately good public transport access. The designer was Arup and the contractor was Harry Neal Ltd.\nFrom the mid-1990s the building was almost entirely unoccupied, with the only tenant being a sandwich shop, and a plan to convert it into a factory outlet did not come to fruition. In 2003, English Heritage placed Tobacco Dock on the Buildings at Risk Register to prevent inappropriate development and decay due to neglect, although at this time it was already a listed building. A meeting was arranged in 2004 to discuss the building with its owners, the Kuwaiti investment company Messila House, to ensure the survival of the historic structure. An English Heritage spokesman commented: \"we see Tobacco Dock as a future priority because it is too large and important a site to be left standing empty. It is one of the most important buildings in London and if brought back into use it would reinvigorate the whole area\". \nIn 2005 the owners announced that they were working on a mixed-use scheme for Tobacco Dock which could incorporate a four-star hotel, shops, and luxury apartments. As of July 2012, the upper areas of the complex were still accessible to the general public whilst the majority of the lower areas were cordoned off.\n\n\n=== Event and film location ===\nIn 1980 the upper floor of Tobacco Dock was used as the filming location for the music video \"Messages\" by the band Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. In early 2004, part of the building was used as the studios of the Channel 4 reality television show Shattered. Several film premiÃ¨re after-parties have also been held there. Tobacco Dock was used for scenes in the sixth episode of the 2008 BBC drama Ashes to Ashes, set in 1981 despite the centre only being developed for its failed use as a shopping centre in 1990. In February 2011 the complex was used to hold a Secret Cinema event for The Red Shoes.\nIn the summer of 2012 the Ministry of Defence used Tobacco Dock as temporary accommodation for 2,500 soldiers deployed to guard the Olympic Games in London.\n\n\n== Current use ==\nTobacco Dock is regularly used for large corporate and commercial events and is a smoke free venue, including its attached car park.  \n\nIn November 2013 and 2014 it was used to host RuneFest 3 and 4 respectively, an event celebrating RuneScape, an online role-playing video game.\nFrom 2013 it was the venue of the annual live-fire food event Meatopia where chefs from around the world cook for over 10,000 people over a weekend.\nSince 2014, the British Academy Games Awards were held every spring as part of EGX Rezzed.\n\n\n== See also ==\nStanley Dock Tobacco Warehouse, in Liverpool; the world's largest brick warehouse\nStepney Historical Trust\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nJuly 18 2005 report from The Times\nAugust 2006 article from nothingtoseehere.net\nNovember 2010 Proposed Hotel and Plaza for Tobacco Dock\nJanuary 2011 Secret cinema location\nJune 2012 Tobacco Dock website"

H. Pownall with other work by Bowes A. Paice and Maurice B. Adams. The clergy houses at the west end are listed separately.MATERIALS & PLAN: Stock brick with polychromatic brick and stone detail and stone dressings.  Slate roofs, tiled roof to baptistery.  Interior red brick with tuck pointing and black brick and stone dressings. Very unusual plan with the W end of the church facing Wapping Lane but screened by the clergy houses which were originally linked at upper level. There is a passageway between the houses with entrances up steps from the passage which leads to a small courtyard in front of the W end of the church. Clerestoried nave with lean-to N and S aisles and transepts, organ chamber in N transept, NE 2-storey sacristy, clerestoried chancel with S chancel chapel.  On the S side there is a gabled mortuary chapel and SW baptistery/unfinished tower.SETTING: The setting is partly the result of World War II bomb damage, the N side of the church, originally attached to other buildings, is now visible across a green space. The London Docks, from which the East window of the church was once visible, have been infilled.  EXTERIOR: Characterised by bold plate traceried and geometric windows, blue brick polychromatic detail and toothed and Lombardic brick corbelling. The chancel has N and S buttresses rising as stone pinnacles flanking the gable which has stepped brick decoration. Large E wall wheel window is recessed under a slightly pointed arch; 2 trefoil-headed lancets below. The NE sacristy has a corbelled parapet decorated with blue brick diapering above a moulded stringcourse. The E end has a segmental-headed doorway with 2-light overlight and square-headed 2-light mullioned window alongside. The upper storey has two 2-light windows with plate tracery and blind stone panels below the sills. The SE chapel has a 3-light plate-traceried E window and 4, bold, high-set quatrefoil S windows in round-headed recesses with splayed sills. The S transept has a large cinquefoil window above a pair of lancets and quatrefoils in the gables, N wall of N transept is blind.   Tall trefoil-headed clerestory lancets to N and S sides of the nave and to the S aisle, the N aisle is blind. The SW baptistery/unfinished tower is red brick with a peaked tiled roof. The W end of the church has a stock brick gable of the Pownall phase, the red brick W end wall breaks forward from the gable and has a moulded W end doorway flanked by one-light trefoil-headed windows. Above them two very large 2-light plate-traceried windows.  The clergy houses at the W end, which are listed separately, are stock brick with red and cream brick and stone detail.  INTERIOR: The church is bold and richly decorated, both with brick and stone bands and diapers but also with furnishings, most of which are C20.  Floor is of patterned encaustic tiles and woodblock. Chancel arch is of two plain orders of 2-centred arches, the inner order on stone shafts on long stone corbels. There are similar arches into the transepts. There is a painted iron chancel screen on a low, coped, ashlar stone wall. The screen and rood beam were planned in 1880 in memory of Father Lowder but not executed until c.1925. The 3-bay N and S arcades with two plain orders of 2-centred arches are on cylindrical piers. The capitals are uncarved blocks of stone except one on the S side, carved with waterleaf. The nave roof is a tie beam, A-frame king post with scissor-bracing in the apex and short straight posts under the tie. These are on timber wall posts on stone shafts that divide the clerestory into bays. Intermediate trusses omit the tie and king post. The nave roof is plastered behind the rafters. The chancel has a panelled barrel ceiling painted with stripes and stencil patterns and a ceilure over the sanctuary. The cross ribs of the ceiling are carried on stone wall shafts on deep stone corbels. Two-bay arcade to the S chapel with an octagonal pier with a capital carved with angels.  FIXTURES & FITTINGS: The SE chapel has a metal screen to the transept and a metal parclose to the chancel. There is a 1950s gilded oak reredos by Lawrence King with vertical panels and posts supporting a deep cornice. The E wall is also panelled and gilded. There is a trefoil-headed piscina in S wall. Choir stalls have shouldered ends with poppyhead finials, the backs of the second tier pierced with quatrefoils. The walls of the SE chapel are panelled with a brattished cornice, the panels incorporating paintings. The chapel has a crested timber reredos with paintings under a frieze of cusped quatrefoils. The tower/baptistery has a brick vaulted roof with stone ribs and a grand ashlar staircase with carved angel newell to the unbuilt W gallery. Font with a plain octagonal bowl on an octagonal stem decorated with shafts. Elaborate timber font cover with ogee-headed niches containing carved figures of saints below a tall conical top crowned with the pelican in her piety. Font shafts and cover painted in the 1950s. A massive font crane with 3 decorative iron brackets is supported by a classical stone structure across the tower staircase. The 1949 iron gates into the baptistery using ironwork salvaged from the bomb-damaged church were designed by Romilly Craze and made by Fred Sage and Co. Nave benches with Y-shaped ends. The former mortuary chapel originally had a doorway to the W. This has been converted into a round-headed window. It is now entered from a plain square-headed doorway from the S aisle. The 1960s trussed roof was inserted following damp problems, corbelled off a wallplate on brackets. The E wall is decorated with 1880s kneeling angels on either side of a tripartite reredos with smaller angels in the side panels. The N wall is decorated with censing angels painted on canvas. There is a cylindrical timber pulpit with columns and a moulded cornice which originated from St Barnabas, Jericho. There is also a plain 3-sided pulpit (not used) from the ritualist All Saints, Margaret Street, LB Westminster. The Lady Chapel has a post-war tryptich reredos, the central panel painted with Our Lady of Wapping by Trevor Griffin, dated 1948. The Virgin is shown in front of a realistic backdrop of dockside buildings. Stained glass mostly post war by M E Aldrich Rope in traditional Gothic style and vivid colours and incorporating local detail. The E window with Our Lady of Walsingham in the centre includes lights with the towers of various London churches. The E window in the SE chapel includes background detail of dockers from different periods. The four S windows of the SE chapel commemorate priests of this church. The Hardman windows in the nave are post-war.  HISTORY: The Church of St Peter, Wapping Lane was built in three stages following a long campaign for public donations from 1860. In 1865-6 the main body of the church was built to designs by F. H. Pownall; the work was not completed until 1939 and the top of the tower and west gallery were never built. In the 1880s, a congregation member, Bowes A. Paice, built a pair of clergy houses (1881-3) adjoining the west end. At around the same time work began on the designs of Maurice B. Adams (the editor of Building News) for a baptistery, SW tower and mortuary chapel at the west end which were built in 1884-94. The third phase of building was after the war and involved repair to the bomb-damaged church and reconstruction of the more northerly of the two houses that had been destroyed by bombing.\n \nThe Church of St Peter, Wapping Lane was constructed and served by the clergyman Charles Fuge Lowder and the Society of the Holy Cross in response to the high population density and acute social welfare problems of the East End in the C19. From 1856, Lowder, first as a curate of St George-in-the-East and then as vicar of St Peter's Wapping Lane, initiated a mission - the first of its kind - to minister to the poor in the East End. It provided social welfare to the area, including schools, adult evening classes and hostels for homeless girls. This was coupled with elaborate rituals, street processions and outdoor preaching led by Lowder from St Peter's Church. After initial suspicion of Lowder's high-church leanings, which resulted in riots in St George-in-the-East in 1859, local residents became sympathetic to the aims of St Peter's Church, impressed by Lowder's dedication to the poor during cholera outbreaks. The church was notable for its large congregations, and a survey in 1902-3 put numbers at over a thousand. St Peter's was the object of a national controversy in 1869 and 1877-8 where Lowder's ritualistic practices were challenged under church worship legislation. The charges were dismissed and Lowder's ministry at St Peter's contributed to the acceptance of High Church ritual within the Church of England. SOURCES: E. Williamson, N. Pevsner and M.

Its location, architecture and fittings articulate the aims of Anglo-Catholic evangelism: to offer the poor a vision of the beauty of holiness coupled with a programme of social welfare. This was a church built with acute sensitivity to its surroundings, including the wheel window which was positioned in the east end gable so as to be visible above the dock wall. The Church is also of more than special interest as a highly-significant church in the rise of Anglo-Catholicism in the second half of the C19; the building bears witness to the liturgy and theology of the influential churchman 'Father' Charles Lowder, with its ornate east end and exuberant use of polycromy. This is a unique historic significance, which is reflected in the architecture the Church of St Peter, which is of a high quality in its own right.\n        \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n    \n        Legacy\n    \n    \n        The contents of this record have been generated from a legacy data system.\n    \n    \n        \n            Legacy System number:\n            \n                206315\n            \n        \n        \n            Legacy System:\n            \n                LBS\n            \n        \n    \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n                    Sources\n                \n                \n                    Books and journalsPevsner, N, Cherry, B, O'Brien, C, The Buildings of England: London 5 East, (2005), 499-500Williamson,  E, Pevsner,  N, The Buildings of England: London Docklands, (1997), 206-208\n                \n\n\n\n                    \n                        \n\n\n    \n        Legal\n    \n\n\n    \n        This building is listed under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as amended for its special architectural or historic interest.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n\n            \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n            \n                Map\n            \n            \n                This map is for quick reference purposes only and may not be to scale.

    "wikipediaText": "St Peter's, Wapping, is a Grade I listed Anglican church in Wapping Lane, Wapping, London, E1W 2RW.\nIt was built in 1865â1939, designed by F. H. Pownall. The organist Thomas Worsley Staniforth composed the hymn tune Jerusalem my happy home to celebrate the laying of the foundation stone.\nThe church was the first Anglican mission to the poor of London. Work was begun in 1856 by the Revd Charles Lowder MA and a group of priests, all were members of the Society of the Holy Cross. The Society had been founded a year earlier with the express purpose of banding priests to a common rule of life and prayer in mission service.\nWapping was one of the poorest districts in London, a haunt of prostitutes and petty criminals, living alongside those who earned a precarious living from the docks.\nLowder's work began in Lower Well Alley (now the park by the James Orwell sports centre) and moved to an iron church in Calvert Street (now Tench Street). Lowder's group of Clergy and Sisters provided practical care through schools, clubs, cheap canteens and child care and spiritual care through a wide range of services, centred on the Mass at the Mission Churches.\n\nIn 1866 the new Church of St Peter was consecrated. Soon afterwards cholera struck the East End. Lowder organised Sisters of Mercy and others to care for the sick and raised funds for a tented hospital. The Priests and Sisters took great risks and worked without stint for the people of Wapping. At the end of the cholera outbreak, people were calling Lowder âthe Fatherâ because he seemed like the father of the whole community.\nAfter Lowder's death in 1880, Maurice Bingham Adams was engaged to design extensions in his memory. In 1884-94 a mortuary, chapel and baptistry were all added.\nFurther work was done to the church in the 1930s, and finished in 1940, only to be immediately destroyed by a bomb in the Blitz. Repairs were completed in 1949. The church was completely renovated in 1985.\nThe Mass on Sunday is at 9.15am (said) and 10.30am (sung). The Church has a regular Thursday attendance from St Peter's, London Docks Church of England Primary School, founded in 1856 the same time as the Church was built as a part of the Mission in Wapping.\n\n\n== References =="

The Admiralty\nbuilt of brown brick with Portland stone dressings and portico, slate roof.  A\nclumsy classical design, hovering between the Baroque and the Palladian, with a\ncramped giant portico; U-shaped on plan.  3 tall storeys and dormered attic.  7-\nwindow wide main block with portico and 8-window deep wings with 2-window wide\nends to Whitehall.  Architraved and corniced doorway to centre under giant Ionic\nportico with pediment containing cartouche carved with Admiralty insignia.\nRecessed glazing bar sashes with slightly cambered gauged brick arches.  Channelled stone quoins; 1st floor sill band; heavy entablature with parapet.  Robert Adam's Portland stone screen to courtyard a monumental, severely Roman facade; central carriage archway framed by pylon-piers with their parapets surmounted by sea horses and flanking screens of Tuscan columns against blind walls supporting entablature, terminating in slightly advanced pedimented pavilions with blind niches; the pediments containing carved reliefs of man o' war prows in the Roman rostral manner.  The interior of Ripley's Admiralty (originally largely residential accommodation for the Lord of the Admiralty with a board room and few offices) retains a number of good interiors: entrance hall with coupled pilasters and central niche containing nearly life size model of the statue on Nelson's column by Baily; vaulted corridor behind hall (repeated on 1st floor)with plasterwork panels rather in Vanbrugh manner; staircase at south end with stone steps and wrought iron balustrade, lit by glazed oval dome of 1785-87\ncontemporary with S. P. Cockerell's elegant work at Admiralty House q.v., next door; the Board Room at the south end would appear to have reset panelled interior from the previous Admiralty building on the site of 1695, the panels articulated by richly carved fluted Corinthian pilasters supporting enriched carved entablature; the marble chimney piece has windcompass overmantel of c.1695, probably by Robert Norden, framed by superbly carved pendant trophies and garlands with nautical instrument motifs very likely by Grinling Gibbons; the coved  plasterwork ceiling of 1789; etc.  N.B. for Admiralty Offices see The Mall.R.

Portland stone,\nslate roofs.  The major Palladian public building of the Burlington-Kent\nschool, but characterised as at Holkham (which it resembles) by Kent's\nstaccato massing and isolation of the component elements of the symmetrical\ncomposition.  Whitehall front has main block set back behind forecourt: 3-\nstoreyed, 3-window wide pedimented centrepiece with one-window links to 4-\nstorey, 1-window projecting pavilions; from subsidiary wings 2-storey\nranges enclose north and south sides of forecourt and link with the rear of\n2-storey, 7-window wide street front pavilions with 3-window pedimented\ncentre breaks.  (N.B. Forecourt railings and guardhouses, see separate\nentry.)  Venetian composition of vaulted carriage archway and side footways\nbeneath centre block.  Recessed glazing bar sashes; semicircular arched and\nset in blind arcading on ground floor; architraved with cornices to principal\nbays on 1st floor where the central window and those in the angle pavilions\nare set in semicircular arched panels.  Pediment of main block with carved\nRoyal Arms, balustraded parapet over links and pyramidal slate roofs over\nattic storeys of angle pavilions.  The Horse Guards Parade front has similar\nmain block but with inscribed Venetian windows to centre and over archway\nand to 1st floor of angle pavilions; instead of a pedimented centre, a\nbalustraded parapet is carried across between the angle pavilions.  3-storey,\n5-window wide wings are set well back but with advanced arcaded ground floors\nwith balustraded parapets, and with projecting 2-storey, 3-window, pedimented\nterminal pavilion-wings.  The latter have central inscribed Venetian windows\nflanked by semicircular arched recesses of the same size containing pedimented\nwindows, all with blind balustrades below sills.  On this front the ground floor\nhas rock faced rustication with ashlar rustication to upper floor of main block\nand terminal pavilion wings.  Over the centre of the main block rises an\noctagonal, domed clock tower with cupola lantern (repeating a distinguishing\nfeature of the old Horse Guards) that breaks the Palladian canon, owing more\nto Vanbrugh in its contours and detail.  The interiors relatively plain\nexcept for the principal rooms in the main block and the octagonal hall\nopen to the lantern; etc.  As in other Kent-Burlington designs the General\nWade's House elevational theme, based on a Palladio town house elevational\ndrawing acquired by Lord Burlington in 1719, appears on the Horse Guards\nParade front.          \nSurvey of London: vol XVI\nTracing a Palladio Elevation; Dan Cruickshank; AR 1045 March 1984\nListing NGR: TQ3007280099\n        \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n    \n        Legacy\n    \n    \n        The contents of this record have been generated from a legacy data system.\n    \n    \n        \n            Legacy System number:\n            \n                207595\n            \n        \n        \n            Legacy System:\n            \n                LBS\n            \n        \n    \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n                    Sources\n                \n                \n                    Books and journals'Survey of London' in Charing Cross the Parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields Part 1: Volume 16 , , Vol. 16, (1935)'Architectural Review' in Architectural Review, , Vol. 1045, (1984)\n                \n\n\n\n                    \n                        \n\n\n    \n        Legal\n    \n\n\n    \n        This building is listed under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as amended for its special architectural or historic interest.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n\n            \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n            \n                Map\n            \n            \n                This map is for quick reference purposes only and may not be to scale.

    "wikipediaText": "Horse Guards is a historic building in the City of Westminster, London, between Whitehall and Horse Guards Parade. It was built in the mid-18th century, replacing an earlier building, as a barracks and stables for the Household Cavalry. The current and previous buildings were, between the early 18th century and 1858, the main military headquarters for the British Empire. Horse Guards originally formed the entrance to the Palace of Whitehall and later St James's Palace; for that reason it is still ceremonially defended by the King's Life Guard. \nAlthough still in military use, part of the building houses the Household Cavalry Museum which is open to the public. It also functions as a gateway between Whitehall and St James's Park.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first Horse Guards building was commissioned by King Charles II in 1663, on the site of a cavalry stables which had been built on the tiltyard of the Palace of Whitehall during the Commonwealth. Built of red brick and costing some Â£4,000, it comprised a central range with a clock tower, under which an arch connected Whitehall with St James's Park; two wings enclosed a courtyard with two large sentry boxes for mounted troopers on the Whitehall side, facing the palace gate. Entry to the park, then an enclosed private garden, was controlled by special ivory passes issued to favoured courtiers, a tradition which continues to the present, although the modern passes are made of plastic; only the monarch has the right to drive through the arch without a pass. Initially, the building was intended only to accommodate the King's Guard and included stabling for more than a hundred cavalry horses on the ground floor, as well as separate barracks for the foot guards. Following a fire at Whitehall in 1698, the court transferred to St James's Palace, therefore the function of Horse Guards changed to controlling the ceremonial approach to St James's from Westminster.\n\nIn the following decades, Horse Guards was increasingly used as administrative offices for the growing regular army and soon became overcrowded. The fabric of the building was also allowed to deteriorate; pieces of falling masonry were said to be a danger to the sentries. In 1745, King George II commissioned a new building in the fashionable Palladian style by the architect William Kent. Having to reuse the same plot of land, Kent managed to retain essentially the same plan as the original building while doubling the interior space. Kent died in April 1748 before the old Horse Guards had been demolished; work on the new building commenced in 1750 under the direction of Kent's assistant, John Vardy and William Robinson from the Office of Works. The cost of the buildings was Â£65,000 and took nearly ten years to complete. The Household Cavalry moved into the northern wing of the uncompleted building in 1755; at that time, there was stabling for 62 horses compared to 17 today. Originally, the two wings were connected to the central block by single storey ranges; in 1803-5 a further two floors were added to these, giving the building its present appearance. Kent's decision to retain a Baroque clock tower on his new Palladian building resulted in a peculiar blend of styles, perhaps the cause of it being described by Charles Knight as \"the ugliest building in the metropolis\".\nThe building also served as the offices for the various administrative departments responsible to the Secretary at War, which would eventually become formalised as the War Office. Also located at Horse Guards was the office of the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces. Hence, for many decades the term 'Horse Guards' was used as a metonym for British Army headquarters. Two famous occupants of the office, a room originally intended for courts-martial, were Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany (1795â1809), popularly believed to be \"The Grand Old Duke of York\", and the Duke of Wellington (1827â28 and 1842â1852). Wellington's coffin rested in this room on the night before his state funeral in 1852. The final Commander-in-Chief at Horse Guards was Prince George, Duke of Cambridge, who was so reluctant to move to the new War Office building at Cumberland House in Pall Mall that he had to be ordered to vacate the building by Queen Victoria in 1858. Wellington's desk is preserved in the same room, which is now the office of the Major-General Commanding the Household Division and General Officer Commanding London District. Horse Guards subsequently became the headquarters of two major Army commands: the London District and the Household Cavalry.\n\nAt the annual Trooping the Colour ceremony in June, members of the Royal Family who are not participants watch the parade from the windows of Wellington's office over the archway.\n\n\n== Horse Guards Clock ==\nThe clock is sited in the turret above the main archway; it has two faces, one facing Whitehall and the other, Horse Guards Parade, each dial being 7 feet 5 inches (2.26 metres) in diameter. It strikes the quarter-hours on two bells. Originally made by Thwaites in 1756, the clock was rebuilt in 1815â16 by Benjamin Lewis Vulliamy, the clockmaker to King George III. Prior to the completion of the clock of Big Ben in 1859, the Horse Guards Clock was the main public clock in Westminster. A dark stain above the Roman number two on the clock face is supposed to mark the time of the execution of King Charles I in 1649, which took place in the roadway outside Horse Guards. The annual ceremony of Trooping the Colour commences when the Horse Guards Clock strikes eleven.\n\n\n== Household Cavalry Museum ==\n\nThe Household Cavalry Museum is the official museum of the Household Cavalry and is located in the Horse Guards. Visitors can view the horses in the 18th-century working stables through a glazed partition. Exhibits explain the training and history of the regiment and include ceremonial uniforms, regalia, royal standards, awards, musical instruments, horse furniture and silverware by FabergÃ©. Visitors to the museum are welcome to watch the afternoon inspection of the guards and horses that happens daily at 4 pm. This routine began in 1894 when Queen Victoria found the guards drinking and gambling in the afternoon instead of tending to their duty. She proclaimed that they would be punished by a four o'clock inspection daily for the next 100 years. This proclamation and punishment officially expired in 1994, but Queen Elizabeth II chose to continue the inspection out of respect for tradition.\n\n\n== Ceremonial ==\n\nEvery morning, the mounted King's Life Guard rides from Hyde Park Barracks in Knightsbridge, by way of Hyde Park Corner, Constitution Hill and The Mall, to take over guard duties in a ceremony at 11:00 am, or 10:00 am on Sundays. The guard is usually provided by the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, which consists of a squadron from each of the Household Cavalry regiments; the Life Guards who wear red tunics and white helmet-plumes, and the Blues and Royals who wear blue tunics and red plumes. However, some other mounted units from Britain and other Commonwealth realms occasionally mount the guard; the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police are examples.\nWhen the monarch is in London, the guard consists of one officer and twelve other ranks including a trumpeter and standard bearer; known as a Long Guard. When the monarch is not in London, the guard is reduced to two non-commissioned officers and ten troopers; known as a Short Guard.\nThe ceremony of Changing The King's Life Guard takes place on Horse Guards Parade adjacent to the Horse Guards building. Two mounted sentries guard the entrance to Horse Guards on Whitehall from 10:00 am until 4:00 pm and are changed every hour. There is a dismounted parade at 4:00 pm (described above) and two dismounted sentries remain on duty until 8:00 pm.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nStocqueler, Joachim Hayward (1873).

    "wikipediaText": "Dover House is a Grade I-listed mansion in Whitehall, and the London headquarters of the Office of the Secretary of State for Scotland. The building also houses the Office of the Advocate General for Scotland and the Independent Commission for Aid Impact.\n\n\n== History ==\nDover House was designed by James Paine as the London townhouse of  Sir Matthew Fetherstonhaugh, Bart., MP, in the 1750s. It was remodelled by Henry Flitcroft, as \"Montagu House\", for George Montagu, created 1st Duke of Montagu, who had moved from nearby Bloomsbury. It was refurbished once again, by Henry Holland for the Prince Frederick, Duke of York, from 1788 to 1792. The building belonged to the Melbourne family from 1793 to 1830.\nIt has also been home to a French ambassador and Lady Caroline Lamb, with whom the Romantic poet Lord Byron famously had an affair. Its most notable feature is an entrance hall in the form of a rotunda inserted into the former forecourt by Holland, which is a unique entrance to a London mansion. The last private owners were the family of the Whig politician George James Welbore Agar-Ellis, created (1831) Baron Dover, whose title it has retained.\n\n\n== Government use ==\nThe Agar-Ellis heirs owned Dover House from 1830 to 1885, when it became the Scottish Office, the UK government department responsible for Scottish affairs.\nAlthough mostly used for the Scottish Office, this building was used by the Colonial Office for several years from 1941 onwards. In 1946 the Glasgow Herald speculated that \"It will not be many years before the building will be put to demolition and new Government offices raised on the site.\" It was still in use by the Colonial Office when Zionist terrorists planted a bomb there in April 1947.\nWhen Scotland acquired a devolved parliament, the responsibilities of the Scottish Office were reduced and, in 1999, was renamed the Scotland Office with Dover House remaining as its chief London building. The Scotland Office also has a Scottish headquarters, on Melville Crescent in Edinburgh's New Town.\nThe Independent Commission for Aid Impact is also based at Dover House.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nStourton, James (2012).

    "wikipediaText": "St James the Less is a Church of England parish church in Pimlico, Westminster, built in 1858â61 by George Edmund Street in the Gothic Revival style. A Grade I listed building, it has been described as \"one of the finest Gothic Revival churches anywhere\". The church was constructed predominantly in brick with embellishments from other types of stone. Its most prominent external feature is its free-standing Italian-style tower, while its interior incorporates design themes which Street observed in medieval Gothic buildings in continental Europe.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe church was Street's first commission in London, which he took on after his widely admired work in the diocese of Oxford and at All Saints, Boyne Hill, Maidenhead, where he delivered buildings in polychromatic red brick and stone. He had also published in 1855, to considerable acclaim, his book Brick and Marble Architecture in Italy. In 1858, he was commissioned by the three daughters of the Bishop of Gloucester (James Henry Monk) to construct a church in their father's memory in what was, at the time, an area of slums and run-down tenements in a very poor part of London. The parish was inhabited by around 31,000 people at the time. The church, which stands on land formerly owned by Westminster Abbey, was consecrated in 1861. Street also built a parish school next to the church in 1861â64, in similar style, while his son Arthur Edmund Street revisited his father's designs in 1890 to add an infants' school (now a parish hall) attached to the west end of the church.\nThe church originally favoured the high church, Anglo-Catholic style of worship but over the decades became more of a broad church. By the time of its centenary, however, it faced closure due to dwindling numbers of worshippers. A campaign was mounted by Sir John Betjeman and others which resulted in the church gaining a reprieve. It was eventually united with the nearby church of St Saviour's, Pimlico. In the 21st century, it falls within the Charismatic Evangelical tradition.\nSt James the Less is now embedded in the centre of the Lillington Gardens estate, which was built around the church in three phases between 1964 and 1972. The estate replaced a 12-acre (4.9 ha) area of dilapidated stucco-fronted houses with a dense low-rise series of residential buildings, constructed with dark red brick cladding interspersed with concrete bands. The designers, Darbourne & Darke, set out specifically to complement the church and to avoid the use of precast concrete cladding, contemporary at the time, because they felt that it did not weather well in the British climate. The results were praised by the architectural critic Sir Nikolaus Pevsner, who wrote that the designers had chosen to ensure that \"the architectural style of 1960 [is] proclaiming its appreciation of the style of 1860\", which he considered \"very gratifying to us committed Victorians.\" He declared the design of the estate to be \"admirable in itself and admirable for its understanding of High Victorian values.\"\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe church stands back from Vauxhall Bridge Road (from which it would not originally have been visible when built) and lies parallel to the road. It is constructed primarily from red bricks with an exterior embellished with black bricks, bands of Morpeth stone, voussoirs of coloured bricks and marble shafts. The steeply sloping roof is covered with slate, with a gable at one end and carried round the apse as a half-cone at the other end. The building is surrounded by cast-iron railings of Street's design, topped with wrought-iron crestings representing lilies. These were a last-minute addition inspired by the design of railings which closed-off the chapels within Barcelona Cathedral's cloister. They were made by James Leaver of Maidenhead in 1866.\n\nA columned porch and passage leads out towards the street. Above the porch is a free-standing tower reminiscent of an Italian campanile, an architectural feature that Street greatly admired (\"there are no features of Italian buildings which are so universally remembered with pleasure\"). The tower is topped by a spire whose bulk is emphasised by being corbeled out, giving the structure a somewhat top-heavy look. The spire is of an unconventional design, starting as a pyramid before splitting into a central spike flanked by four spirelets. Street had seen similar examples at Tournai in Belgium and at Genoa in Italy; it seems likely that he based that of St James the Less on the latter examples, which he described in a lecture delivered while he was working on the church.\nThe overall effect was quite unlike that of the traditional English church tower, but followed John Ruskin's prescription that \"where the height of the tower itself is to be made apparent, it must be ... detached as a campanile\" and \"there must be one bounding line from base to coping.\" Street later wrote that this \"breadth of effect\" was \"the very point which northern architects were most careless to succeed\" and which, by implication, he sought to deliver in his churches. His tower at St James the Less was his most pronounced example of a free-styling campanile, though he built similar examples of solid, massive, freestanding towers at a number of other churches in England and Rome.\n\nThe church's interior has a broad aspect with three wide bays leading up to the apse. The walls are dominated by red brick, which is contrasted with black brick, mastic and red and yellow glazed tiles which link the floor to the lower walls. The nave is lined with short granite columns, each with carved capitals by W. Pearce, which support arcades of notched and moulded bricks. The capitals are illustrated with carvings of parables and miracles. At the clerestory end are three-light windows in the first two bays and plate tracery in the third. The chancel is separated from the nave by a prominent arch. Unlike the nave, it is groined in brick and is extensively decorated with mosaic and inlaid marble. The design of the sanctuary thus makes it a distinctively darker and more elaborately mysterious area of the church.\nMany of the church's interior features were inspired by the architecture of churches in France, Italy and Germany. The columns and capitals reflect those of the chapter house and cloister of St-Georges de Boscherville near Rouen, while the vaulting is a reinterpretation of that in the church of St Jacques, CompiÃ¨gne. St-Pierre in Paris's Montmartre district provided further inspiration.\nThe fittings of St James the Less are mostly original and were part of Street's vision for the church. A heavily carved pulpit was carved by Thomas Earp, though it is now somewhat battered. In 1861 George Frederic Watts provided a fresco of the Last Judgement known as \"The Doom\" above the chancel arch. He replaced it in the 1880s with a mosaic of Venetian glass made to the same design, after the original fresco had deteriorated. The church's stained glass was designed by Clayton and Bell and depicts various saints, including its patron St James the Less. The font is capped by an unusual domed iron canopy that was displayed at the 1862 International Exhibition.\n\n\n== Critical views ==\n\nAlthough St James the Less is now highly regarded â Pevsner described it as \"one of the finest Gothic Revival churches anywhere\" â views of its merits were not uniformly positive at the time of its construction. The British Almanac and Companion for 1864 complained of how, for the current generation of church architects,\n\n irregularity of outline seems now to be the guiding principle in designing a church, symmetry and simplicity the abiding terror of the Church architect. To avoid these, he will snip up the outside of his church into as many odd peaks and projections, and decorate it with as many 'bands', lines and dubious ornaments, as though he were a Nuremberg toy-maker. \nThe reviewer in The Ecclesiologist in 1861 was much more positive, however, commenting that Street had \"stepped beyond the mere repetition of English mediaeval forms, to produce a building in which a free eclectic manipulation of parts has been grafted upon a system of polychromatic construction, having its basis on the fact that London is a brick town.\"  The Illustrated London News contrasted the church with its impoverished surroundings, calling it \"a lily among weeds\".\nCharles Eastlake, in his A History of the Gothic Revival (1872), declared that \"the whole character of the building, whether we regard its plan, its distinctive external or internal decorations is eminently un-English\". He was particularly fulsome in praise of its campanile-like tower, declaring that \"if Mr. Street had never designed anything but the campanile of this churchâand its Italian character justifies the nameâit would be sufficient to proclaim him an artist. In form, proportion of parts, decorative detail, and use of colour, it seems to leave little to be desired.\" The church was no mere imitation of continental European forms either; as Street's son Arthur put it, \n\nwhat is Italian has become so entirely absorbed in what belongs to the architect's own inspiration, that it is hard to put the finger on any actual features which recall Italian examples, the influence being traceable rather in the choice and management of materials, and the general massing of the block of buildings, than in any more specific points.\n\n\n== References =="

    "wikipediaText": "Cleopatra's Needle in London is one of a pair of obelisks, together named Cleopatra's Needles, that were moved from the ruins of the Caesareum of Alexandria, in Egypt, in the 19th century. Inscribed by Thutmose III and later Ramesses II of the Egyptian New Kingdom, the obelisk was moved in 12 BC to Alexandria, where it remained for over 1,800 years.\nIt was presented to the United Kingdom in 1819 by the ruler of Egypt and Sudan Muhammad Ali, as a diplomatic gift. Although the British government welcomed the gesture, it declined to pay to move the obelisk to London. It was subsequently erected in the West End of London on the Victoria Embankment in Westminster, in 1878.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe obelisk was originally erected in the Egyptian city of Heliopolis on the orders of Thutmose III, around 1450 BC. It is of granite, brought from the quarries of Aswan, near the first cataract of the Nile. Thutmose III had a single column of text carved on each face, these were translated by E. A. Wallis Budge. Other inscriptions were added about 200 years later by Ramesses II to commemorate his military victories: these are in two columns on each face, flanking the original inscriptions. The obelisks were moved to Alexandria and set up in the Caesareum, a temple built by Cleopatra in honour of Mark Antony or Julius Caesar  by the Romans in 12 BC, during the reign of Augustus, but one was toppled some time later. This had the fortuitous effect of burying its faces and so preserving most of the hieroglyphs from the effects of weathering.\n\n\n== Transport from Alexandria ==\nThe obelisk remained in Alexandria until 1877 when Sir William James Erasmus Wilson, a distinguished anatomist and dermatologist, sponsored its transportation to London from Alexandria at a cost of some Â£10,000 (equivalent to over Â£1,000,000 in 2020). Following consultation with Mathew William Simpson, a railway and locomotive engineer working for the Khedive of Egypt and a friend of Wilson who shared his passion for Egyptian antiquities, it was dug out of the sand in which it had been buried for nearly 2,000 years and was encased in a great iron cylinder, 92 feet (28 metres) long and 16 feet (4.9 metres) in diameter. This was designed by the engineer John Dixon (from original plans drawn up for Wilson by Mathew William Simpson, who was unable to undertake the work due to being under contract to the Khedive), and dubbed Cleopatra, to be commanded by Captain Carter. It was built at the Thames Iron Works, shipped to Alexandria in separate pieces, and built around the obelisk by Waynman Dixon, John's brother. It had a vertical stem and stern, a rudder, two bilge keels, a mast for balancing sails, and a deck house. This acted as a floating pontoon which was to be towed to London by the ship Olga, commanded by Captain Booth.\n\nThe effort almost met with disaster on 14 October 1877, in a storm in the Bay of Biscay, when the Cleopatra began wildly rolling, and became uncontrollable. The Olga sent out a rescue boat with six volunteers, but the boat capsized and all six crew were lost â they are named on a bronze plaque attached to the foot of the needle's mounting stone. Captain Booth on the Olga eventually managed to get his ship next to the Cleopatra and rescued Captain Carter and the five crew members aboard Cleopatra. Captain Booth reported the Cleopatra \"abandoned and sinking\", but she stayed afloat, drifting in the Bay, until found four days later by Spanish trawler boats, and then rescued by the Glasgow steamer Fitzmaurice and taken to Ferrol in Spain for repairs. The Master of the Fitzmaurice lodged a salvage claim of Â£5,000 which had to be settled before departure from Ferrol, but it was negotiated down and settled for Â£2,000. The William Watkins Ltd paddle tug Anglia, under the command of Captain David Glue, was then commissioned to tow the Cleopatra back to the Thames. On their arrival in the estuary on 21 January 1878, the school children of Gravesend were given the day off. A wooden model of the obelisk had previously been placed outside the Houses of Parliament, but the location had been rejected, so the London needle was finally erected on the Victoria Embankment on 12 September 1878.\n\n\n== Erection ==\n\nThe original master stone mason who worked on the granite foundation was Lambeth-born William Henry Gould (1822â1891).\nOn erection of the obelisk in 1878, a time capsule was concealed in the front part of the pedestal, containing 12 photographs of the best-looking English women of the day, a box of hairpins, a box of cigars, several tobacco pipes, a set of imperial weights, a baby's bottle, some children's toys, a shilling razor, a hydraulic jack and some samples of the cable used in the erection, a 3-foot (90-centimetre) bronze model of the monument, a complete set of contemporary British coins, a rupee, a portrait of Queen Victoria, a history of the transport of the monument plans, written on vellum, a translation of the inscriptions, copies of the Bible in several languages, a copy of John 3:16 in 215 languages, a copy of Whitaker's Almanack, a Bradshaw Railway Guide, a map of London, and copies of 10 daily newspapers. A twenty-four inch metal ruler (see p.173 Born in Blood by John J. Robinson)\n\nCleopatra's Needle is flanked by two faux-Egyptian sphinxes, designed by the English architect George John Vulliamy. The sphinxes are cast in bronze and bear hieroglyphic inscriptions that say netjer nefer men-kheper-re di ankh, which translates as \"the good god, Thuthmosis III given life\". These sphinxes appear to be looking at the Needle rather than guarding it, due to the sphinxes' improper or backwards installation. The Embankment has other Egyptian flourishes, such as buxom winged sphinxes on the armrests of benches. On 4 September 1917, during World War I, a bomb from a German air raid landed near the needle. In commemoration of this event, the damage remains unrepaired to this day and is clearly visible in the form of shrapnel holes and gouges on the western sphinx. Restoration work was carried out in 2005.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Egyptian obelisks\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Cleopatra's Needle (London) at Wikimedia Commons"

    "wikipediaText": "The National Gallery is an art museum in Trafalgar Square in the City of Westminster, in Central London, England. Founded in 1824, it houses a collection of more than 2,300 paintings dating from the mid-13th century to 1900. The current director of the National Gallery is Gabriele Finaldi.\nThe National Gallery is an exempt charity, and a non-departmental public body of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Its collection belongs to the government on behalf of the British public, and entry to the main collection is free of charge.\nUnlike comparable museums in continental Europe, the National Gallery was not formed by nationalising an existing royal or princely art collection. It came into being when the British government bought 38 paintings from the heirs of John Julius Angerstein in 1824. After that initial purchase, the gallery was shaped mainly by its early directors, especially Charles Lock Eastlake, and by private donations, which now account for two-thirds of the collection. The collection is smaller than many European national galleries, but encyclopaedic in scope; most major developments in Western painting \"from Giotto to CÃ©zanne\" are represented with important works. It used to be claimed that this was one of the few national galleries that had all its works on permanent exhibition, but this is no longer the case.\nThe present building, the third site to house the National Gallery, was designed by William Wilkins. Building began in 1832 and it opened to the public in 1838. Only the faÃ§ade onto Trafalgar Square remains essentially unchanged from this time, as the building has been expanded piecemeal throughout its history. Wilkins's building was often criticised for the perceived weaknesses of its design and for its lack of space; the latter problem led to the establishment of the Tate Gallery for British art in 1897. The Sainsbury Wing, a 1991 extension to the west by Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown, is a significant example of Postmodernist architecture in Britain.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The call for a National Gallery ===\n\nThe late 18th century saw the nationalisation of royal or princely art collections across mainland Europe. The Bavarian royal collection (now in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich) opened to the public in 1779, that of the Medici in Florence around 1789 (as the Uffizi Gallery), and the Museum FranÃ§ais at the Louvre was formed out of the former French royal collection in 1793. Great Britain, however, did not follow other European countries, and the British Royal Collection still remains in the sovereign's possession. In 1777, the British government had the opportunity to buy an art collection of international stature, when the descendants of Sir Robert Walpole put his collection up for sale. The MP John Wilkes argued for the government to buy this \"invaluable treasure\" and suggested that it be housed in \"a noble gallery... to be built in the spacious garden of the British Museum\". Nothing came of Wilkes's appeal and 20 years later the collection was bought in its entirety by Catherine the Great; it is now to be found in the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg.\nA plan to acquire 150 paintings from the OrlÃ©ans collection, which had been brought to London for sale in 1798, also failed, despite the interest of both the King and the Prime Minister, Pitt the Younger. The twenty-five paintings from that collection now in the gallery, including \"NG1\", arrived later by a variety of routes. In 1799, the dealer NoÃ«l Desenfans offered a ready-made national collection to the British government; he and his partner Sir Francis Bourgeois had assembled it for the king of Poland, before the Third Partition in 1795 abolished Polish independence. This offer was declined and Bourgeois bequeathed the collection to his old school, Dulwich College, on his death. The collection opened in 1814 in Britain's first purpose-built public gallery, the Dulwich Picture Gallery. The Scottish dealer William Buchanan and the collector Joseph Count Truchsess both formed art collections expressly as the basis for a future national collection, but their respective offers (both made in 1803) were also declined.\nFollowing the Walpole sale many artists, including James Barry and John Flaxman, had made renewed calls for the establishment of a National Gallery, arguing that a British school of painting could only flourish if it had access to the canon of European painting. The British Institution, founded in 1805 by a group of aristocratic connoisseurs, attempted to address this situation. The members lent works to exhibitions that changed annually, while an art school was held in the summer months. However, as the paintings that were lent were often mediocre, some artists resented the Institution and saw it as a racket for the gentry to increase the sale prices of their Old Master paintings. One of the Institution's founding members, Sir George Beaumont, Bt, would eventually play a major role in the National Gallery's foundation by offering a gift of 16 paintings.\nIn 1823, another major art collection came on the market, which had been assembled by the recently deceased John Julius Angerstein. Angerstein was a Russian-born Ã©migrÃ© banker based in London; his collection numbered 38 paintings, including works by Raphael and Hogarth's Marriage A-la-Mode series. On 1 July 1823, George Agar-Ellis, a Whig politician, proposed to the House of Commons that it purchase the collection. The appeal was given added impetus by Beaumont's offer, which came with two conditions: that the government buy the Angerstein collection, and that a suitable building was to be found. The unexpected repayment of a war debt by Austria finally moved the government to buy Angerstein's collection, for Â£57,000.\n\n\n=== Foundation and early history ===\n\nThe National Gallery opened in 1824 in Angerstein's former townhouse at No. 100 Pall Mall. Angerstein's paintings were joined in 1826 by those from Beaumont's collection, and in 1831 by the Reverend William Holwell Carr's bequest of 35 paintings. Initially the Keeper of Paintings, William Seguier, bore the burden of managing the gallery, but in July 1824 some of this responsibility fell to the newly formed board of trustees.\nThe National Gallery at Pall Mall was frequently overcrowded and hot, and its diminutive size in comparison with the Louvre in Paris was a cause of national embarrassment. But Agar-Ellis, by then a trustee of the gallery, appraised the site for being \"in the very gangway of London\"; this was seen as necessary for the gallery to fulfil its social purpose. Subsidence in No. 100 caused the gallery to move briefly to No. 105 Pall Mall, which the novelist Anthony Trollope described as a \"dingy, dull, narrow house, ill-adapted for the exhibition of the treasures it held\". This in turn had to be demolished for the opening of a road to Carlton House Terrace.\nIn 1832, construction began on a new building by William Wilkins on the northern half of the site of the old Royal Mews in Charing Cross, after the transformation of its southern half into Trafalgar Square in the late 1820s. The location was a significant one, between the wealthy West End and poorer areas to the east. The argument that the collection could be accessed by people of all social classes outstripped other concerns, such as the pollution of central London or the failings of Wilkins's building, when the prospect of a move to South Kensington was mooted in the 1850s. According to the Parliamentary Commission of 1857, \"The existence of the pictures is not the end purpose of the collection, but the means only to give the people an ennobling enjoyment\".\n\n\n=== Growth under Eastlake and his successors ===\n15th- and 16th-century Italian paintings were at the core of the National Gallery and for the first 30 years of its existence the trustees' independent acquisitions were mainly limited to works by High Renaissance masters. Their conservative tastes resulted in several missed opportunities and the management of the gallery later fell into complete disarray, with no acquisitions being made between 1847 and 1850. A critical House of Commons report in 1851 called for the appointment of a director, whose authority would surpass that of the trustees. Many thought the position would go to the German art historian Gustav Friedrich Waagen, whom the gallery had consulted on previous occasions about the lighting and display of the collections. However, the man preferred for the job by Queen Victoria, Prince Albert and the Prime Minister, Lord John Russell, was the Keeper of Paintings at the gallery, Sir Charles Lock Eastlake. Eastlake, who was President of the Royal Academy, played an essential role in the foundation of the Arundel Society and knew most of London's leading art experts.\n\nThe new director's taste was for the Northern and Early Italian Renaissance masters or \"primitives\", who had been neglected by the gallery's acquisitions policy but were slowly gaining recognition from connoisseurs. He made annual tours to the continent and to Italy in particular, seeking out appropriate paintings to buy for the gallery. In all, he bought 148 pictures abroad and 46 in Britain, among the former such seminal works as Paolo Uccello's The Battle of San Romano. Eastlake also amassed a private art collection during this period, consisting of paintings that he knew did not interest the trustees. His ultimate aim, however, was for them to enter the National Gallery; this was duly arranged upon his death by his friend and successor as director, William Boxall, and his widow Lady Elizabeth Eastlake.\nOne of the most persistent criticisms of the National Gallery, other than of the perceived inadequacies of the building, has been of its conservation policy. The gallery's detractors have accused it of having had an over-zealous approach to restoration. The first cleaning operation at the National Gallery began in 1844 after Eastlake's appointment as Keeper, and was the subject of attacks in the press after the first three paintings to receive the treatment â a Rubens, a Cuyp and a VelÃ¡zquez â were unveiled to the public in 1846. The gallery's most virulent critic was J. Morris Moore, who wrote a series of letters to The Times under the pseudonym \"Verax\" savaging the institution's cleanings. While an 1853 Parliamentary select committee set up to investigate the matter cleared the gallery of any wrongdoing, criticism of its methods has been erupting sporadically ever since from some in the art establishment.\n\nThe gallery's lack of space remained acute in this period. In 1845, a large bequest of British paintings was made by Robert Vernon; there was insufficient room in the Wilkins building so they were displayed first in Vernon's town house at No. 50 Pall Mall and then at Marlborough House. The gallery was even less well equipped for its next major bequest, as J. M. W. Turner was to bequeath the entire contents of his studio, excepting unfinished works, to the nation upon his death in 1851. The first 20 of these were displayed off-site in Marlborough House in 1856. Ralph Nicholson Wornum, the gallery's Keeper and Secretary, worked with John Ruskin to bring the bequest together. The stipulation in Turner's will that two of his paintings be displayed alongside works by Claude is still honoured as of 2024, but his bequest has never been adequately displayed in its entirety; today the works are divided between Trafalgar Square and the Clore Gallery, a small purpose-built extension to Tate Britain completed in 1985.\nThe third director, Sir Frederic William Burton, laid the foundations of the collection of 18th-century art and made several outstanding purchases from English private collections. The acquisition in 1885 of two paintings from Blenheim Palace, Raphael's Ansidei Madonna and van Dyck's Equestrian Portrait of Charles I, with a record-setting grant of Â£87,500 from the Treasury, brought the gallery's \"golden age of collecting\" to an end, as its annual purchase grant was suspended for several years thereafter. When the gallery purchased Holbein's Ambassadors from the Earl of Radnor in 1890, it did so with the aid of private individuals for the first time in its history. In 1897, the formation of the National Gallery of British Art, known unofficially from early in its history as the Tate Gallery, allowed some British works to be moved off-site, following the precedent set by the Vernon collection and the Turner Bequest. Works by artists born after 1790 were moved to the new gallery on Millbank, which allowed Hogarth, Turner and Constable to remain in Trafalgar Square.\n\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\n\nThe agricultural crisis at the turn of the 20th century caused many aristocratic families to sell their paintings, but the British national collections were priced out of the market by American plutocrats. This prompted the foundation of the National Art-Collections Fund, a society of subscribers dedicated to stemming the flow of artworks to the United States. Their first acquisition for the National Gallery was VelÃ¡zquez's Rokeby Venus in 1906, followed by Holbein's Portrait of Christina of Denmark in 1909. However, despite the crisis in aristocratic fortunes, the following decade was one of several great bequests from private collectors. In 1909, the industrialist Ludwig Mond gave 42 Italian Renaissance paintings, including the Mond Crucifixion by Raphael, to the gallery. Other bequests of note were those of George Salting in 1910, Austen Henry Layard in 1916 and Sir Hugh Lane in 1917.\nThe initial reception of Impressionist art at the gallery was exceptionally controversial. In 1906, Sir Hugh Lane promised 39 paintings, including Renoir's Umbrellas, to the National Gallery on his death, unless a suitable building could be built in Dublin. Although eagerly accepted by the director Charles Holroyd, they were received with extreme hostility by the trustees; Lord Redesdale wrote that \"I would as soon expect to hear of a Mormon service being conducted in St. Paul's Cathedral as to see the exhibition of the works of the modern French Art-rebels in the sacred precincts of Trafalgar Square\". Perhaps as a result of such attitudes, Lane amended his will with a codicil that the works should only go to Ireland, but crucially this was never witnessed. Lane died on board the RMS Lusitania in 1915, and a dispute began which was not resolved until 1959. Part of the collection is now on permanent loan to the Hugh Lane Gallery and other works rotate between London and Dublin every few years.\nA fund for the purchase of modern paintings established by Samuel Courtauld in 1923 bought Seurat's Bathers at AsniÃ¨res and other modern works for the nation; in 1934, many of these were transferred to the National Gallery from the Tate.\nThe director Kenneth Clark's decision in 1939 to label a group of Venetian paintings, Scenes from Tebaldeo's Eclogues, as works by Giorgione was controversial at the time, and the panels were soon identified as works by Andrea Previtali by a junior curator Clark had appointed.\n\n\n=== Second World War ===\n\nShortly before the outbreak of the Second World War the paintings were evacuated to locations in Wales, including Penrhyn Castle and the university colleges of Bangor and Aberystwyth. In 1940, during the Battle of France, a more secure home was sought, and there were discussions about moving the paintings to Canada. This idea was firmly rejected by Winston Churchill, who wrote in a telegram to Kenneth Clark, \"bury them in caves or in cellars, but not a picture shall leave these islands\". Instead a slate quarry at Manod, near Blaenau Ffestiniog in North Wales, was requisitioned for the gallery's use. In the seclusion afforded by the paintings' new location, the Keeper (and future director) Martin Davies began to compile scholarly catalogues on the collection, with assistance of the gallery's library which was also stored in the quarry. The move to Manod confirmed the importance of storing paintings at a constant temperature and humidity, something the gallery's conservators had long suspected but had hitherto been unable to prove. This eventually resulted in the first air-conditioned gallery opening in 1949.\nFor the course of the war Myra Hess and other musicians, such as Moura Lympany, gave daily lunch-time recitals in the empty building in Trafalgar Square, to raise public morale as every concert hall in London was closed. Art exhibitions were held at the gallery as a complement to the recitals. The first of these was British Painting since Whistler in 1940, organised by Lillian Browse, who also mounted the major joint retrospective Exhibition of Paintings by Sir William Nicholson and Jack B. Yeats held from 1 January to 15 March 1942, which was seen by 10,518 visitors. Exhibitions of work by war artists, including Paul Nash, Henry Moore and Stanley Spencer, were also held; the War Artists' Advisory Committee had been set up by Clark in order \"to keep artists at work on any pretext\". In 1941, a request from an artist to see Rembrandt's Portrait of Margaretha de Geer (a new acquisition) resulted in the \"Picture of the Month\" scheme, in which a single painting was removed from Manod and exhibited to the general public in the National Gallery each month. The art critic Herbert Read, writing that year, called the National Gallery \"a defiant outpost of culture right in the middle of a bombed and shattered metropolis\". The paintings returned to Trafalgar Square in 1945.\n\n\n=== Post-war developments ===\nThe last major outcry against the use of radical conservation techniques at the National Gallery was in the immediate post-war years, following a restoration campaign by the gallery's chief restorer Helmut Ruhemann while the paintings were in Manod Quarry. When the cleaned pictures were exhibited to the public in 1946 there followed a furore with parallels to that of a century earlier. The principal criticism was that the extensive removal of varnish, which was used in the 19th century to protect the surface of paintings but which darkened and discoloured over time, may have resulted in the loss of \"harmonising\" glazes added to the paintings by the artists themselves. The opposition to Ruhemann's techniques was led by Ernst Gombrich, a professor at the Warburg Institute who in later correspondence with a restorer described being treated with \"offensive superciliousness\" by the National Gallery. A 1947 commission concluded that no damage had been done in the recent cleanings.\n\nIn the post-war years, acquisitions have become increasingly difficult for the National Gallery as the prices for Old Masters â and even more so for the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists â have risen beyond its means. Some of the gallery's most significant purchases in this period would have been impossible without the major public appeals backing them, including Leonardo da Vinci's cartoon of The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne and Saint John the Baptist (bought in 1962) and Titian's Death of Actaeon (bought in 1972). The gallery's purchase grant from the government was frozen in 1985, but later that year it received an endowment of Â£50 million from Sir Paul Getty, enabling many major purchases to be made. In April 1985 Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover and his brothers, the Hon. Simon Sainsbury and Sir Timothy Sainsbury, had made a donation that would enable the construction of the Sainsbury Wing.\nThe directorship of Neil MacGregor saw a major rehang at the gallery, dispensing with the classification of paintings by national school that had been introduced by Eastlake. The new chronological hang sought to emphasise the interaction between cultures rather than fixed national characteristics, reflecting the change in art-historical values since the 19th century. In other respects, however, Victorian tastes were rehabilitated: the building's interiors were no longer considered an embarrassment and were restored, and in 1999 the gallery accepted a bequest of 26 Italian Baroque paintings from Sir Denis Mahon. Earlier in the 20th century many considered the Baroque to be beyond the pale: in 1945 the gallery's trustees declined to buy a Guercino from Mahon's collection for Â£200. The same painting was valued at Â£4 million in 2003. Mahon's bequest was made on the condition that the gallery would never deaccession any of its paintings or charge for admission.\n\nJock McFadyen was the first Artist in Residence in 1981. Since 1989, the gallery has run an Associate Artist scheme that gives a studio to contemporary artists to create work based on the permanent collection. They usually hold the position of associate artist for two years and are given an exhibition in the National Gallery at the end of their tenure.\nThe respective remits of the National and Tate Galleries, which had long been contested by the two institutions, were more clearly defined in 1996. 1900 was established as the cut-off point for paintings in the National Gallery, and in 1997 more than 60 post-1900 paintings from the collection were given to the Tate on a long-term loan, in return for works by Gauguin and others. However, future expansion of the National Gallery may yet see the return of 20th-century paintings to its walls.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nIn the 21st century there have been three large fundraising campaigns at the gallery: in 2004, to buy Raphael's Madonna of the Pinks; in 2008, for Titian's Diana and Actaeon; and in 2012, Titian's Diana and Callisto. Both Titians were bought in tandem with the National Gallery of Scotland for Â£95 m. Both of these major works were sold from the collection of the Duke of Sutherland. The National Gallery is now largely priced out of the market for Old Master paintings and can only make such acquisitions with the backing of major public appeals; the departing director Charles Saumarez Smith expressed his frustration at this situation in 2007.\nThe National Gallery was sponsored by the Italian arms manufacturer Finmeccanica between October 2011 and October 2012. The sponsorship deal allowed the company to use gallery spaces for gatherings, and the gallery was used to host delegates during the DSEI arms fair and the Farnborough Airshow. The sponsorship deal was ended a year early after protests.\nIn February 2014, the gallery purchased Men of the Docks by the American artist George Bellows for $25.5 million (Â£15.6 million). It was the first major American painting to be purchased by the gallery. The director, Nicholas Penny, termed the painting a new direction for the gallery, a non-European painting in a European style. Its sale was controversial in the United States.\nIn 2018, the National Gallery was one of the first public galleries in London to charge more than Â£20 for admission to a special exhibition, the exhibition in question being of works by Claude Monet.\nIn February 2019, an employment tribunal ruled that the gallery had incorrectly classed its team of educators as self-employed contractors. The educators were awarded the status of \"workers\" following legal action brought by 27 claimants. The case received considerable press and media coverage.\nIn 2024, the National Gallery celebrated its 200th anniversary with a range of programmes, events, and collaborations.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== William Wilkins's building ===\n\nThe first suggestion for a National Gallery on Trafalgar Square came from John Nash, who envisaged it on the site of the King's Mews, while a Parthenon-like building for the Royal Academy would occupy the centre of the square. Economic recession prevented this scheme from being built, but a competition for the Mews site was eventually held in 1831, for which Nash submitted a design with Charles Robert Cockerell as his co-architect. Nash's popularity was waning by this time, however, and the commission was awarded to William Wilkins, who was involved in the selection of the site and submitted some drawings at the last moment. Wilkins had hoped to build a \"Temple of the Arts, nurturing contemporary art through historical example\", but the commission was blighted by parsimony and compromise, and the resulting building, which opened to the public on 9 April 1838, was deemed a failure on almost all counts.\nThe site only allowed for the building to be one room deep, as a workhouse and a barracks lay immediately behind. To exacerbate matters, there was a public right of way through the site to these buildings, which accounts for the access porticoes on the eastern and western sides of the faÃ§ade. These had to incorporate columns from the demolished Carlton House, and their relative shortness resulted in an elevation that was deemed excessively low, thus failing to provide Trafalgar Square with its desired commanding focal point to the north. Also recycled are the sculptures on the faÃ§ade, originally intended for Nash's Marble Arch but abandoned due to his financial problems. The eastern half of the building housed the Royal Academy until 1868, which further diminished the space afforded to the National Gallery.\nThe building was the object of public ridicule before it had even been completed, as a version of the design had been leaked to The Literary Gazette in 1833. Two years before completion, its infamous \"pepperpot\" elevation appeared on the frontispiece of Contrasts (1836), an influential tract by the Gothicist Augustus Pugin, as an example of the degeneracy of the classical style. Even William IV (in his last recorded utterance) thought the building a \"nasty little pokey hole\", while William Makepeace Thackeray called it \"a little gin shop of a building\". The twentieth-century architectural historian Sir John Summerson echoed these early criticisms when he compared the arrangement of a dome and two diminutive turrets on the roofline to \"the clock and vases on a mantelpiece, only less useful\". Sir Charles Barry's landscaping of Trafalgar Square, from 1840, included a north terrace so that the building would appear to be raised, thus addressing one of the points of complaint. Opinion on the building had mellowed considerably by 1984, when Prince Charles called the Wilkins faÃ§ade a \"much-loved and elegant friend\", in contrast to a proposed extension. (See below)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Alteration and expansion (Pennethorne, Barry and Taylor) ===\nThe first significant alteration made to the building was the single, long gallery added by Sir James Pennethorne in 1860â1861. Ornately decorated in comparison with the rooms by Wilkins, it nonetheless worsened the cramped conditions inside the building as it was built over the original entrance hall. Unsurprisingly, several attempts were made either to completely remodel the National Gallery (as suggested by Sir Charles Barry in 1853), or to move it to more capacious premises in Kensington, where the air was also cleaner. In 1867 Barry's son Edward Middleton Barry proposed to replace the Wilkins building with a massive classical building with four domes. The scheme was a failure and contemporary critics denounced the exterior as \"a strong plagiarism upon St Paul's Cathedral\".\nWith the demolition of the workhouse, however, Barry was able to build the gallery's first sequence of grand architectural spaces, from 1872 to 1876. Built to a polychrome Neo-Renaissance design, the Barry Rooms were arranged on a Greek cross plan around a huge central octagon. Though it compensated for the underwhelming architecture of the Wilkins building, Barry's new wing was disliked by Gallery staff, who considered its monumental aspect to be in conflict with its function as exhibition space. Also, the decorative programme of the rooms did not take their intended contents into account; the ceiling of the 15th- and 16th-century Italian gallery, for instance, was inscribed with the names of British artists of the 19th century. However, despite these failures, the Barry Rooms provided the gallery with a strong axial groundplan; this was to be followed by all subsequent additions to the gallery for a century, resulting in a building of clear symmetry.\nPennethorne's gallery was demolished for the next phase of building, a scheme by Sir John Taylor extending northwards of the main entrance. Its glass-domed entrance vestibule had painted ceiling decorations by the Crace family firm, who had also worked on the Barry Rooms. A fresco intended for the south wall was never realised.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 20th century: modernisation versus restoration ===\n\nLater additions to the west came more steadily but maintained the coherence of the building by mirroring Barry's cross-axis plan to the east. The use of dark marble for doorcases was also continued, giving the extensions a degree of internal consistency with the older rooms. The classical style was still in use at the National Gallery in 1929, when a Beaux-Artsâstyle gallery was built, funded by the art dealer and trustee Lord Duveen. However, it was not long before the 20th-century reaction against Victorian attitudes became manifest at the gallery. From 1928 to 1952, the landing floors of Taylor's entrance hall were relaid with a new series of mosaics by Boris Anrep, who was friendly with the Bloomsbury Group. These mosaics can be read as a satire on 19th-century conventions for the decoration of public buildings, as typified by the Albert Memorial's Frieze of Parnassus. The central mosaic depicting The Awakening of the Muses includes portraits of Virginia Woolf and Greta Garbo, subverting the high moral tone of its Victorian forebears. In place of Christianity's seven virtues, Anrep offered his own set of Modern Virtues, including \"Humour\" and \"Open Mind\"; the allegorical figures are again portraits of his contemporaries, including Winston Churchill, Bertrand Russell and T. S. Eliot.\nIn the 20th century, the gallery's late Victorian interiors fell out of fashion. The Crace ceiling decorations in the entrance hall were not to the taste of the director Charles Holmes, and were obliterated by white paint.\nThe North Galleries, which opened to the public in 1975, marked the arrival of modernist architecture at the National Gallery. In the older rooms, the original classical details were effaced by partitions, daises and suspended ceilings, the aim being to create neutral settings which did not distract from contemplation of the paintings. But the gallery's commitment to modernism was short-lived: by the 1980s Victorian style was no longer considered anathema, and a restoration programme began to restore the 19th- and early 20th-century interiors to their purported original appearance. This began with the refurbishment of the Barry Rooms in 1985â1986. From 1996 to 1999 even the North Galleries, by then considered to \"lack a positive architectural character\", were remodelled in a classical style, albeit a simplified one.\n\n\n=== Sainsbury Wing and later additions ===\n\nThe most important addition to the building in the late 20th century was the Sainsbury Wing, designed by the postmodernist architects Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown to house the collection of Renaissance paintings and built in 1991. The building occupies the \"Hampton's site\" to the west of the main building, where a department store of the same name had stood until its destruction in the Blitz. The gallery had long sought expansion into this space and in 1982 a competition was held to find a suitable architect; the shortlist included a radical high-tech proposal by Richard Rogers, among others. The design that won the most votes was by the firm Ahrends, Burton and Koralek, who then modified their proposal to include a tower, similar to that of the Rogers scheme. The proposal was dropped after the Prince of Wales compared the design to a \"monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much-loved and elegant friend\". The term \"monstrous carbuncle\", for a modern building that clashes with its surroundings, has since become commonplace.\nOne of the conditions of the 1982 competition was that the new wing had to include commercial offices as well as public gallery space. However, in 1985 it became possible to devote the extension entirely to the gallery's uses, due to a donation of almost Â£50 million from Lord Sainsbury and his brothers Simon and Sir Tim Sainsbury. A closed competition was held, and the schemes produced were noticeably more restrained than in the earlier competition.\n\nIn contrast with the rich ornamentation of the main building, the galleries in the Sainsbury Wing are pared down and intimate, to suit the smaller scale of many of the paintings. The main inspirations for these rooms are Sir John Soane's toplit galleries for the Dulwich Picture Gallery and the church interiors of Filippo Brunelleschi. (The stone dressing is in pietra serena, the grey stone local to Florence.) The northernmost galleries align with Barry's central axis, so that there is a single vista down the whole length of the gallery. This axis is exaggerated by the use of false perspective, as the columns flanking each opening gradually diminish in size until the visitor reaches the focal point (as of 2009), an altarpiece by Cima of The Incredulity of Saint Thomas. Venturi's postmodernist approach to architecture is in full evidence at the Sainsbury Wing, with its stylistic quotations from buildings as disparate as the clubhouses on Pall Mall, the Scala Regia in the Vatican, Victorian warehouses and Ancient Egyptian temples.\nFollowing the pedestrianisation of Trafalgar Square, the gallery is currently engaged in a masterplan to convert the vacated office space on the ground floor into public space. The plan will also fill in disused courtyards and make use of land acquired from the adjoining National Portrait Gallery in St Martin's Place, which it gave to the National Gallery in exchange for land for its 2000 extension. The first phase, the East Wing Project designed by Jeremy Dixon and Edward Jones, opened to the public in 2004. This provided a new ground level entrance from Trafalgar Square, named in honour of Sir Paul Getty. The main entrance was also refurbished, and reopened in September 2005. Possible future projects include a \"West Wing Project\" roughly symmetrical with the East Wing Project, which would provide a future ground level entrance, and the public opening of some small rooms at the far eastern end of the building acquired as part of the swap with the National Portrait Gallery. This might include a new public staircase in the bow on the eastern faÃ§ade. No timetable has been announced for these additional projects.\n\n\n==== Renovation of the Sainsbury Wing ====\nIn April 2021, a jury short-listed six firms of architects â Caruso St John, David Chipperfield Architects, Asif Kahn, David Kohn Architects, Selldorf Architects, and Witherford Watson Mann Architects â in a competition for design proposals to upgrade the Sainsbury Wing.\nA letter written in 1990 by one of the donors, John Sainsbury, was discovered in 2023 during the demolition of two false columns in which he argued that \"the false columns are a mistake of the architect and that we would live to regret our accepting this detail of his design.\"\nIn 2024, excavations for the Sainsbury Wing extension at Jubilee Walk uncovered evidence that the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Lundenwic extended further to the west than had previously been supposed.\n\n\n== Incidents ==\nIn the National Gallery on 10 March 1914, VelÃ¡zquez's Rokeby Venus was damaged by Mary Richardson, a campaigner for women's suffrage, in protest against the arrest of Emmeline Pankhurst the previous day. Later that month another suffragette attacked five Bellinis, causing the gallery to close until the start of the First World War, when the Women's Social and Political Union called for an end to violent acts drawing attention to their plight.\n\nIn August 1961 an unemployed bus driver, Kempton Bunton, stole Goya's Portrait of the Duke of Wellington, in what remains the only successful theft from the gallery. Four years later, Bunton returned the painting voluntarily. Following a high-profile trial, he was found not guilty of stealing the painting, but guilty of stealing the frame.\nIn July 1987, a man entered the gallery armed with a shotgun concealed under his coat and shot Leonardo's cartoon of The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne and Saint John the Baptist. The man, Robert Cambridge, told police that his intent had been to express his disgust with \"political, social and economic conditions in Britain\". Though the pellets did not penetrate the cartoon, it had to undergo extensive restoration. It was placed back on display the following year.\nVincent van Gogh's Sunflowers was attacked at the gallery on 14 October 2022 by environmental activists from the Just Stop Oil campaign, who threw tomato soup at it. Due to the protection of the plexiglass, the painting was not harmed, but there was some minor damage to the frame, according to a spokesperson for the gallery. \nOn 6 November 2023, the Rokeby Venus was again attacked, by two Just Stop Oil activists who smashed its protective glass with hammers.\n\n\n== List of directors ==\n\n\n== Collection highlights ==\n\n\n== Transport connections ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of most visited museums in the United Kingdom\nList of most visited art museums\nList of largest art museums\nMicro gallery, installed in 1991\n\n\n== Explanatory notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== General sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website \n30 highlight paintings\nVirtual tour of the National Gallery provided by Google Arts & Culture\nThe National Gallery at Pall Mall from the Survey of London\nThe Guardian review of \"My National Gallery\" 2024 film\nThe Guardian review of \"National Gallery\" 2014 film"

    "wikipediaText": "Handel Hendrix House (previously Handel & Hendrix in London) is a museum in Mayfair, London, dedicated to the lives and works of the German-born British baroque composer George Frideric Handel and the American rock singer-guitarist Jimi Hendrix, who lived at 25 and 23 Brook Street respectively.\nHandel made his home in London in 1712 and eventually became a British citizen in 1727. Handel was the first occupant of 25 Brook Street, which he rented from 1723 until his death there in 1759. Almost all his works after 1723, amongst them many of his best-known operas, oratorios and ceremonial music, were composed and partially rehearsed in the house, which contained a variety of keyboard instruments, including harpsichords, a clavichord and a small chamber organ.\nThe museum comprises a carefully restored set of period rooms on the first and second floors of 25 Brook Street together with exhibition rooms in number 23, the adjacent house on the terrace. In 2016 the museum expanded to incorporate the upper floors of 23 Brook Street, home of Jimi Hendrix in the late 1960s.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe museum was opened in 2001 by the Handel House Trust following four decades of tireless and dedicated hard work. The idea first sparked in 1958 when Leslie Sparey, a dentist from the Lake District, made arrangements with Viyella, who occupied 25 Brook Street at the time, for a special visit with his family. A year later musicologist and Handelian Stanley Sadie had the same idea when he attended a commemoration held there for the bicentenary of Handel's death.\nSpareyâs quest for a Handel Museum started when he began writing letters to a few eminent musicians, most of this early correspondence now lost apart from a letter from Sir Keith Faulkner, Director of the Royal College of Music, written on 18 April 1972 in response to a letter he had received from Sparey on 11 April. Sir Keith apologised for not being able to meet during Spareyâs recent visit to London, commented that no one appeared to be willing to take action, and further apologised for having no time to take on the project himself. In January 1983 Sparey drew up a detailed memorandum on the subject of Handelâs house in which he mentioned that despite being a Grade 1 listed building, planning permission had been sought in 1982 for the demolition of five Grade 2 listed buildings, substantially affecting several listed buildings including Handelâs house. Sparey noted that although planning permission had been refused, he understood that the Co-operative Insurance Society, who had acquired 25 Brook Street in 1971, intended to appeal. His memorandum also mentioned that a few years earlier he had helped set up a committee specifically for promoting a Handel museum, with representatives from the Royal College of Music, the Royal Academy of Music, the Arts Council and interested others; having noted that the project had been shelved, Sparey finished his memorandum by pointing out the urgent need in ensuring the permanent preservation of Handel's House. When he mailed the memorandum to a number of prominent musicians and personalities, the following responded favourably: Sir Charles Mackerras, Sir Charles Groves, Christopher Hogwood, Neville Marriner, Richard Baker and Edward Heath.\nBy 1983 the idea of forming The Handel Museum Trust Fund had been mooted, and as a result of a meeting with the Charity Commissioner a draft statement was issued in January 1984, setting out the objects and aims which involved creating a Handel museum in which articles of musical and personal interest from the period would be available for public display, organising events including exhibitions, seminars and concerts, creating scholarships, bursaries and fellowships, and raising funds for making all these aims possible.  \nIn April 1984 Sparey received a letter from Handel scholar Anthony Hicks, secretary of the Provisional Council for a Handel Institute. In his letter Hicks explained that the Institute consisted of a group of musical  scholars, one of them Stanley Sadie, who wished to form a group in order to promote and support Handel studies with the aim of increasing public knowledge of Handelâs life and music. Hicks further explained that although their concept of a Handel Institute wasnât dependent on a specific location, they were interested to hear about the proposal to turn the upper floors of 25 Brook Street into a Handel Museum, whilst hoping to explore with the developers the possibility of the Institute administering or making use of the premises. In Sparey's reply he informed Hicks that the Cooperative Insurance Society Ltd were appealing against the rejection of their development plan for the area, but with the assurance that if they won their case they would be interested in the idea of creating a Handel Museum. Hicks responded by sharing the Provisional Councilâs plans, pointing out that should a Handel Museum materialise at 25 Brook Street, it should incorporate articles of musical and personal interest connected to the life and times of Handel; he also mentioned that if it were to be a centre for Handel studies it would need equipment out of keeping with an elegant Georgian interior, such as microfilm readers, filing cabinets, a xerox machine and tape and disc playing facilities. A compromise, he added, would be use of the first floor as a public exhibition and the upper floors for study and administration. Finally, Hicks stated that in view of the uncertainty concerning plans for the area and that the Handel house would not be available before 1989 at the earliest, the Provisional Council would focus on their own plans without associating with a particular location.  \nSparey's response to Hicks in June 1984 stressed his sense of urgency in exploring the matter as thoroughly as possible despite the uncertainty regarding plans and the length of time before Handelâs house would become available, and having expressed surprise that nothing had been attempted before, he emphasized the need for a few eminent Handel experts to meet and consider the whole concept in depth. \nIn the early 1990s Stanley Sadie and his wife Anne set up the Handel House Trust, the charity which eventually oversaw the conversion of the house into a museum.Having raised funds through a Heritage Lottery Fund grant they were able to purchase the lease of 25 Brook Street from the Co-operative Insurance Society, who had held the freehold since 1971. Following a long period of extensive renovation work, 25 Brook Street finally opened its doors as the Handel House Museum on 8 November 2001.\n\n\n== The Museum ==\nThe house has been restored to look as it did during Handel's 36 year occupancy from 1723 to 1759. A typical early 18th century London terrace house, it comprises a basement, three main storeys and an attic, and Handel was the first occupant. The attic was later converted into a fourth full floor. The ground floor is a shop not associated with the Museum, and the upper floors are leased to a charity called the Handel House Trust, and have been open to the public since 8 November 2001.\nThe interiors have been restored to the somewhat spartan style of the Georgian era, using mostly architectural elements from elsewhere, since, apart from the staircase, few of the original interior features survived.\nThe Handel House Collection Trust has assembled a collection of Handel memorabilia, including the Byrne Collection of several hundred items, which was acquired in 1998.\n\n\n== History of 25 Brook Street ==\n\nHandel acquired 25 Brook Street in the summer of 1723, shortly after having been appointed by George II as composer to the Chapel Royal, for which he was paid Â£400 per annum. The house had been newly built with Nos. 23, 27/29 and 31 by George Barnes as part of the planned extension of Brook Street, linking Hanover Square with Grosvenor Square, between 1717 and 1726. Originally, as a foreign national, Handel was not eligible to buy or take long-term leases on property in London; and even when he acquired British nationality in 1727, Handel continued renting the property on short-term leases. The fact that he remained there for the rest of his life, almost 40 years, is remarkable, since opera composers at the time were rarely of fixed abode; prior to that, Handel had been lodged in the homes of friends and patrons. At the age of 38, Handel had become accepted within the higher echelons of British society, with whom he freely mixed. His immediate neighbours on either side were from the upper middle classes and initially included the Member of Parliament, John Monckton, who later became the first Viscount Galway in 1727.\nThe layout of the rooms followed the conventions for a modest Georgian townhouse: the basement contained the kitchens; on each of the three floors above, there was a front room and a smaller back room with an adjacent closet; under the roof were garrets for servants.\nThe larger front first room was used for rehearsal and probably contained a harpsichord and a small house chamber organ. The museum currently contains a reproduction of a period harpsichord of the Flemish firm Ruckers; a reproduction of a period chamber organ, based on the designs of the \norganbuilders Richard Bridge and Thomas Parker, was made for the Handel House Trust in 1998 and can be seen in Handel's parish church, St George's, Hanover Square, round the corner from Brook Street.\nFrom the 1730s onwards there are many references to rehearsals of operas and oratorios at Brook Street by Handel's friends and fellow musicians. Listening to a rehearsal of Alcina with the soprano Anna Maria Strada, Mrs Pendarves commented, \"Whilst Mr Handel was playing his part, I could not help thinking him a necromancer in the midst of his enchantments.\" Messiah was also rehearsed there; the lead violinist Abraham Wilson recounted to the musicologist Charles Burney \"how civilly he had been attended by him [Handel] to the door, and how carefully cautioned, after being heated by a crowded room and hard labour, at the rehearsal in Brook-street, not to stir without a [Sedan] chair.\"\nThe adjacent room at the rear of the house was Handel's composing room and probably contained Handel's clavichord, an instrument Handel used when composing, portable enough to be taken on journeys and which, according to an anecdote oft-repeated by his biographers, he secretly played as a child in the garret of his house, in defiance of his father. Handel's clavichord was built in 1726 by the Italian instrument maker Annibale Traeri from Modena; it is now in\nthe Maidstone Museum & Art Gallery in Kent.\nThe remaining rooms on the second floor comprised a main bedroom containing a full tester bed dressed in crimson harateen, connected to a dressing room and closet in the back. The servants, three or more in number, occupied the garret rooms on the floor above.\nHandel used his house not only for entertainment, composition and rehearsal, but also for business: in the late 1730s the scores of Alexander's Feast and other works could be purchased directly there. His home also contained an extensive art collection, and by the end of his life Handel possessed over 80 paintings and prints, including works by Watteau, Teniers and Poussin.\nAfter Handel's death in 1759, his musical instruments passed to John Christopher Smith and his son of the same name: the father had been summoned from the continent by Handel to act as his copyist when Handel first arrived in London; and his son had acted as amanuensis and assistant when Handel's blindness prevented him from writing and conducting in his later years. The tenancy of the house and Handel's clothing passed to his servant John Du Burk. The detailed inventory, a transcript of which is now stored in the British Library, gives a clear guide as to how the house was decorated and used. Apart from the conversion of the garrets into a fourth storey in the 1830s, the house remained largely unchanged until 1905, when C. J. Charles converted the house into a shop, removing the original faÃ§ade and the internal dividing walls. It was subsequently occupied by interior decorators and antiques dealers. In 1971 it was acquired by the Co-operative Insurance Society and the Handel House Trust has leased the upper storeys of the property since 2000.\n\n\n== Restoration ==\n2 pr Stairs foreward  \na bedstead with whole teaster Crimson haritten furniture a feather bed bolster 2 pillows a White Mattress three blanketts & a Quilt 3 pr of Red Window Curtains & Rods a Stove Tongs & Poker. 6 Old Matted Chairs a Round Close Stool & white pann a Wicker Fire Screen a Glass in Wall'd frame\n\nWhen the Handel House Trust leased 25 Brook Street in 2000, it had already been decided that Handel's rooms on the first and second floors would be restored to their prior eighteenth century state as far as possible. This was justified by the fact that it was only Handel's occupancy that had led to the classification as a Grade I listed building and by the presence of an internal period staircase in near perfect condition. Later partition walls were removed to restore the original Georgian room plans. The refurbishment of the interior, including panelling, shutters, window seats and cornices, was based primarily on period details from the adjacent house at 27/29 Brook Street. Three marble Georgian fireplaces, formerly in Russell Street, Covent Garden, were installed in the first floor rooms and bedroom. The floorboards were replaced with old wood, treated with lime and wax, and the ceilings refinished with lime plaster.\nCareful research revealed samples of the original 1720s paint on woodwork on the staircase and surviving second floor door, which in its history had been painted 28 times. The original colour was lead grey throughout the house and No. 27/29; the door had been subsequently painted chocolate brown, a colour popular in Georgian times for concealing grime. These are the colours that have been used to redecorate the house, with more grey on the first floor to indicate its importance.\nThe detailed two page inventory from August 1759, made after more valuable items had been removed, gave a guide to the furnishings of the house. The paired curtains \nmentioned in the inventory, although in vogue in the 1720s, had fallen out of fashion by the 1750s. On the first floor the curtains would have been of green silk, but are listed only for the back room; possibly there were none in the rehearsal room in the front for acoustic reasons.\nMost of the furniture was in walnut with a few tables in oak. Although none of Handel's original furniture has been found, pieces have been placed in the rooms which adhere as closely as possible to the inventory. The large full tester bed with it crimson harateen hangings has been reconstructed, using a period bed; the woven wool fabric and silk braid for the upholstery and curtains were prepared based on a full tester bed at Hanbury Hall, Worcestershire. The bed linen, pillows and quilt mentioned in the inventory have been recreated using items from the Historic Royal Palaces.\n\n\n== Permanent collection ==\n\nIn 1998 the Handel House Collections Trust acquired the Byrne Collection, a large collection of several hundred objects connected with Handel. These include:\n\ncorrespondence of Handel,\noriginal manuscripts,\na copy of one of the first biographies of Handel by John Mainwaring, with marginal comments by his friend and librettist Charles Jennens,\nearly editions of operas and oratorios\nprints,\npaintings\nsculptures.\nAround the same time the trust also bought two paintings of Jennens (by Thomas Hudson) and the opera singer Faustina Bordoni (by Bartolomeo Nazari).\n\n\n== 25 Brook Street ==\n\nIn 2022 it was reported that Handel & Hendrix in London had embarked on a Â£3 million project to open all of Handel's house to the public for the first time.\nThe following rooms have been open to the public.\n\n\n=== Rehearsal and performance room ===\nOn the first floor at the front of the house, this was used as a rehearsal room by Handel from the 1730s onwards. It contains portraits of contemporary singers and a reproduction of a two manual harpsichord by the Flemish firm Ruckers. The harpsichord is used for concerts and is also available for rehearsals by musicians from the general public.\n\n\n=== Composition room ===\nOn the first floor at the back of the house, this is believed to be the room in which Handel composed some of his most celebrated works, including Messiah. It contains portraits of Handel and Charles Jennens, Handel's friend and librettist of Messiah.\n\n\n=== London room ===\nOn the second floor at the rear of the house, this served as Handel's dressing room and was originally connected to a small closet.\n\n\n=== Bedroom ===\nOn the second floor at the front of the house, this is probably the room where Handel died. A complete inventory was made within months of his death. Amongst the furniture, it describes a large canopied tester bed similar to the one now in the room.\n\n\n== 23 Brook Street ==\n\nThe museum incorporates the upper floors of its neighbour at 23 Brook Street, which was the home of American rock singer-guitarist Jimi Hendrix in 1968â1969. These rooms were used for temporary exhibitions and events, but after fundraising, these and the rest of the rooms from the Hendrix apartment were opened to the public in February 2016 as \"Handel and Hendrix in London\". One exhibit permanently on display here is a collection of Hendrix's old records. Both houses have blue plaques for their respective occupants.\n\n\n== Opening hours and events ==\nThe house is open to the public five days a week, Wednesday-Sunday. The museum has a lively events programme including live music, changing exhibitions, lectures and children's educational events. Several performances of baroque music are staged each month, recitals are sometimes during opening hours, but more usually in the early evening for a separate charge.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of music museums\nWill of George Frideric Handel\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Other references ===\n\"Press announcement for Handel Reveal'd\". handelhouse.org.

    "wikipediaText": "The Royal Ballet and Opera, formerly the Royal Opera House (ROH), is a major performing arts organisation, based at the historic Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, central London. The large building is often referred to as simply Covent Garden, after a previous use of the site. The Royal Ballet and Opera is the parent company of The Royal Opera, The Royal Ballet, and the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, all based at the Royal Opera House. The first theatre on the site, the Theatre Royal (1732), served primarily as a playhouse for the first hundred years of its history. In 1734, the first ballet was presented. A year later, the first season of operas, by George Frideric Handel, began. Many of his operas and oratorios were specifically written for Covent Garden and had their premieres there.\nThe current building is the third theatre on the site, following disastrous fires in 1808 and 1856 to previous buildings. The faÃ§ade, foyer, and auditorium date from 1858, but almost every other element of the present complex dates from an extensive reconstruction in the 1990s. The main auditorium seats 2,256 people, making it the third largest in London, and consists of four tiers of boxes and balconies and the amphitheatre gallery. The proscenium is 14.80 metres (48 ft 7 in) wide, with the stage of the same depth and 12.20 metres (40 ft 0 in) high. The main auditorium is a Grade I listed building.\nThe Royal Opera House organisation was rebranded as the Royal Ballet and Opera in 2024. The building however retains its historic name of Royal Opera House. \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Davenant patent ===\n\nThe foundation of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden lies in the letters patent awarded by Charles II to Sir William Davenant in 1662, allowing Davenant to operate one of only two patent theatre companies (The Duke's Company) in London. The letters patent remained in the possession of the patentees' heirs until the 19th century. Their whereabouts were unknown for some time, but as of 2019 they are held in the Rosenbach Museum & Library, Philadelphia.\n\n\n=== First theatre ===\n\nIn 1728, John Rich, actor-manager of the Duke's Company at Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre, commissioned The Beggar's Opera from John Gay. The success of this venture provided him with the capital to build the Theatre Royal (designed by Edward Shepherd) at the site of an ancient convent garden. Inigo Jones had developed part of this property in the 1630s with a piazza and St Paul's church (now known colloquially as the actors' church). In addition, a Royal Charter had created a fruit and vegetable market in the area, a market which survived in that location until 1974.\nAt the opening of the theatre on 7 December 1732, Rich was carried by his actors in procession into the building for its inaugural production of William Congreve's The Way of the World.\nDuring its first century, the theatre was operated primarily as a playhouse, with the Letters Patent granted by Charles II giving the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden and Theatre Royal, Drury Lane exclusive rights to present spoken drama in London. Despite the frequent interchangeability between the two companies, competition was intense, and the companies often presented the same plays at the same time. Rich introduced pantomime to the repertoire, performing himself, under the stage name John Lun, as Harlequin. A tradition of seasonal pantomime continued at the modern theatre until 1939.\nIn 1734, the theatre presented its first ballet, Pygmalion. Marie SallÃ© discarded tradition and her corset and danced in diaphanous robes. George Frideric Handel was named musical director of the company at Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1719, but his first season of opera for the theatre was not presented until 1734. His first opera was Il pastor fido, followed by Ariodante (1735), and the premiÃ¨re of Alcina, and Atalanta the following year. In 1743 there was a royal performance of Messiah; its success resulted in a tradition of Lenten oratorio performances. From 1735 until his death in 1759, Handel gave regular seasons at the theatre; many of his operas and oratorios were written for that venue or had their first London performances there. He bequeathed his organ to John Rich, and it was placed in a prominent position on the stage. It was among many valuable items lost in a fire that destroyed the theatre on 20 September 1808. In 1792 the architect Henry Holland rebuilt the auditorium; he expanded its capacity within the existing shell of the building.\n\n\n=== Second theatre ===\n\nRebuilding began in December 1808, and the second Theatre Royal, Covent Garden (designed by Robert Smirke) opened on 18 September 1809 with a performance of Macbeth followed by a musical entertainment called The Quaker. The actor-manager John Philip Kemble, raised seat prices to help recoup the cost of rebuilding and the cost of an increased ground rent introduced by the landowner, the Duke of Bedford, but the move was so unpopular that audiences disrupted performances by beating sticks, hissing, booing and dancing. The Old Price Riots lasted over two months, and the management was finally forced to accede to the audience's demands.\nDuring this time, entertainments were varied; opera and ballet were presented, but not exclusively. Kemble engaged a variety of acts, including the child performer Master Betty; the great clown Joseph Grimaldi made his name at Covent Garden. Many famous actors of the day appeared at the theatre, including the tragediennes Sarah Siddons and Eliza O'Neill, the Shakespearean actors William Macready, Edmund Kean and his son Charles. On 25 March 1833 Edmund Kean collapsed on stage while playing Othello, and died two months later.\nIn 1806, the pantomime clown Joseph Grimaldi (The Garrick of Clowns) had performed his greatest success in Harlequin and Mother Goose; or the Golden Egg at Covent Garden, and this was subsequently revived, at the new theatre. Grimaldi was an innovator: his performance as Joey introduced the clown to the world, building on the existing role of Harlequin derived from the Commedia dell'arte. His father had been ballet-master at Drury Lane, and his physical comedy, his ability to invent visual tricks and buffoonery, and his ability to poke fun at the audience were extraordinary.\nEarly pantomimes were performed as mimes accompanied by music, but as Music hall became popular, Grimaldi introduced the pantomime dame to the theatre and was responsible for the tradition of audience singing. By 1821 dance and clowning had taken such a physical toll on Grimaldi that he could barely walk, and he retired from the theatre. By 1828, he was penniless; Drury Lane held a benefit concert for him after Covent Garden refused.\n\nIn 1817, bare flame gaslight had replaced the former candles and oil lamps that lighted the Covent Garden stage. This was an improvement, but in 1837 Macready employed limelight in the theatre for the first time, during a performance of a pantomime, Peeping Tom of Coventry. Limelight used a block of quicklime heated by an oxygen and hydrogen flame. This allowed the use of spotlights to highlight performers on the stage.\nThe Theatres Act 1843 broke the patent theatres' monopoly of drama. At that time Her Majesty's Theatre in the Haymarket was the main centre of ballet and opera but after a dispute with the management in 1846 Michael Costa, conductor at Her Majesty's, transferred his allegiance to Covent Garden, bringing most of the company with him. The auditorium was completely remodeled after an 1856 fire, during the following 1856â57 seasons, the company performed at the Lyceum Theatre. The theatre reopened as the Royal Italian Opera on 6 April 1857 with a performance of Rossini's Semiramide.\nIn 1852, Louis Antoine Jullien the French eccentric composer of light music and conductor presented an opera of his own composition, Pietro il Grande. Five performances were given of the 'spectacular', including live horses on the stage and very loud music. Critics considered it a complete failure and Jullien was ruined and fled to America.\n\nCosta and his successors presented all operas in Italian, even those originally written in French, German or English, until 1892, when Gustav Mahler presented the debut of Wagner's Ring cycle at Covent Garden. The word \"Italian\" was then quietly dropped from the name of the opera house.\nThe conjuror John Henry Anderson, who had exposed the Davenport brothers, leased the theatre to stage his shows which were critical of mediums and spiritualism. After a gala performance and bal masquÃ© organised by Anderson, the theatre caught fire in the early hours of 5 March 1856 and was destroyed.\n\n\n=== Third theatre ===\nWork on a third theatre, designed by Edward Middleton Barry, started in 1857, and the new building, which still remains as the nucleus of the present theatre, was built by Lucas Brothers and opened on 15 May 1858 with a performance of Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots.\nThe Royal English Opera company under the management of Louisa Pyne and William Harrison, made their last performance at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, on 11 December 1858 and took up residence at Covent Garden on 20 December 1858 with the premiere of Michael Balfe's Satanella â the first opera to have its world premiere at the new theatre â and continued there until 1865.\nThe theatre became the Royal Opera House (ROH) in 1892, and the number of French and German works offered increased. Winter and summer seasons of opera and ballet were given, and the building was also used for pantomime, recitals and political meetings.\nDuring the First World War, the theatre was requisitioned by the Ministry of Works for use as a furniture repository.\nFrom 1934 to 1936, Geoffrey Toye was managing director, working alongside the artistic director Sir Thomas Beecham. Despite early successes, Toye and Beecham eventually fell out, and Toye resigned.\nDuring the Second World War the ROH became a dance hall. There was a possibility that it would remain so after the war but, following lengthy negotiations, the music publishers Boosey & Hawkes acquired the lease of the building. David Webster was appointed General Administrator, and Sadler's Wells Ballet was invited to become the resident ballet company. The Covent Garden Opera Trust was created and laid out plans \"to establish Covent Garden as the national centre of opera and ballet, employing British artists in all departments, wherever that is consistent with the maintenance of the best possible standards ...\"\nThe Royal Opera House reopened on 20 February 1946 with a performance of The Sleeping Beauty in an extravagant new production designed by Oliver Messel. Webster, with his music director Karl Rankl, immediately began to build a resident company. In December 1946, they shared their first production, Purcell's The Fairy-Queen, with the ballet company. On 14 January 1947, the Covent Garden Opera Company gave its first performance of Bizet's Carmen.\nBefore the grand opening, the Royal Opera House presented one of the Robert Mayer Children's concerts on Saturday, 9 February 1946.\n\n\n=== Opera at the Royal Opera House after 1945 ===\n\n\n=== Ballet at the Royal Opera House after 1945 ===\n\n\n=== Reconstruction from the 1980s forward ===\n\nSeveral renovations had taken place to parts of the house in the 1960s, including improvements to the amphitheatre but the theatre clearly needed a major overhaul. In 1975 the Labour government gave land adjacent to the Royal Opera House for a long-overdue modernisation, refurbishment, and extension. In the early 1980s the first part of a major renovation included an extension to the rear of the theatre on the James Street corner. The development added two new ballet studios, offices, a Chorus Rehearsal Room and the Opera Rehearsal room. Dressing rooms were also added.\n\nBy 1995, sufficient funds from the Arts Lottery through Arts Council England and private fundraising had been raised to enable the company to embark upon a major Â£213 million reconstruction of the building by Carillion, which took place between 1997 and 1999, under the chairmanship of Sir Angus Stirling. This involved the demolition of almost the whole site including several adjacent buildings to make room for a major increase in the size of the complex. The auditorium itself remained, but well over half of the complex is new.\nThe design team was led by Jeremy Dixon and Edward Jones of Dixon Jones BDP as architects. The acoustic designers were Rob Harris and Jeremy Newton of Arup Acoustics. The building engineer was Arup with Stanhope as developer.\n\nThe new building has the same traditional horseshoe-shaped auditorium as before, but with greatly improved technical, rehearsal, office, and educational facilities. Additionally, a new studio theatre, the Linbury, as well as more public space was created. The inclusion of the adjacent old Floral Hall, which had fallen into disrepair and was used as a scenery store before redevelopment, created a new and extensive public gathering place. The venue is now claimed by the ROH to be the most modern theatre facility in Europe.\nSurtitles, projected onto a screen above the proscenium, have been used for all opera performances since they were introduced for school matinees in the 1983/4 season. Since the reopening of the theatre in 1999 an electronic libretto system provides translations onto small video screens for some seats, and additional monitors and screens are to be introduced to other parts of the house.\nIn 2014 design work, known as the Open Up Project, began with the aim of opening the theatre's building to the public during the day, as well as improving the entrances, lobby areas and the Linbury Theatre. As part of the Open Up Project, IQ Projects were tasked with the renovation of the upper floor bar area and restaurant utilising various elements of bespoke glazing.\nIn October 2020, the BBC reported that the Royal Opera House had lost 60% of its income as a result of restrictions implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a consequence, the 1971 Portrait of Sir David Webster by David Hockney, which had hung in the opera house for several decades, was put up for auction at Christie's. It eventually sold for Â£12.8 million. The funds raised from the sale were needed to ensure the survival of the institution. \"Significant redundancies\" and an appeal for public donations were also made. In addition, the opera house applied for a loan to the Culture Recovery Fund.\nIn 2023 members of the orchestra were selected to play at the coronation of Charles III and Camilla.\nIn 2024, the public branding of the venue and its associated online and media presence was changed from the Royal Opera House to Royal Ballet and Opera to reflect the combined companies that call the physical building their home. The physical building itself remains the Royal Opera House whilst the branding and business operations change their title to reflect this adjustment.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\n\n\n=== Paul Hamlyn Hall ===\n\nThe Paul Hamlyn Hall is a large iron and glass structure adjacent to, and with direct access to, the main opera house building. The hall now acts as the atrium and main public area of the opera house, with a champagne bar, restaurant and other hospitality services, and also providing access to the main auditorium at all levels.\nThe building was formerly known as Floral Hall. It was originally built by the Opera House to house a flower market (also selling fruits and vegetables), hence the name. It was designed by Edward Middleton Barry and opened in 1860. After being used as a concert hall, it became part of the Covent Garden Market in 1887. A fire broke out in the building in 1956, after which it sat derelict. It was acquired by the Opera House in 1977 and used as storage space.\nThe redevelopment of the Floral Hall as part of the 1990s redevelopment project involved lifting up the cast iron structure to accommodate new public areas for the opera house underneath. The southern side of the hall now connected with another building, so the cast iron south portico was dismantled and rebuilt in Borough Market, where it is separately Grade II heritage listed.\nThe redevelopment had gone ahead on the strength of a pledge of Â£10m from the philanthropist Alberto Vilar and for a number of years, it was known as the Vilar Floral Hall; however Vilar failed to make good his pledge. As a result, the name was changed in September 2005 to the Paul Hamlyn Hall, after the opera house received a donation of Â£10m from the estate of Paul Hamlyn, towards its education and development programmes.\nAs well as acting as a main public area for performances in the main auditorium, the Paul Hamlyn Hall is also used for hosting a number of events, including private functions, dances, exhibitions, concerts, and workshops.\n\n\n=== Linbury Studio Theatre ===\nThe Linbury Studio Theatre is a flexible, secondary performance space, constructed below ground level within the Royal Opera House. It has retractable raked seating and a floor which can be raised or lowered to form a studio floor, a raised stage, or a stage with orchestra pit. The theatre can accommodate up to 400 patrons and host a variety of different events. It has been used for private functions, traditional theatre shows, and concerts, as well as community and educational events, product launches, dinners and exhibitions, etc., and is one of the most technologically advanced performance venues in London with its own public areas, including a bar and cloakroom.\n\nThe Linbury is most notable for hosting performances of experimental and independent dance and music, by independent companies and as part of the ROH2, the contemporary producing arm of the Royal Opera House. The Linbury Studio Theatre regularly stages performances by the Royal Ballet School and also hosts the Young British Dancer of the Year competition.\nThe venue was constructed as part of the 90s redevelopment of the Royal Opera House. It is named in recognition of donations made by the Linbury Trust towards the redevelopment. The Trust is operated by Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover and his wife Anya Linden, a former dancer with the Royal Ballet. The name Linbury is derived from the names Linden and Sainsbury. It was opened in 1999 with a collaboration from three Croydon secondary schools (including Coloma Convent Girls' School and Edenham High School) in an original performance called About Face.\n\n\n=== Royal Opera House, Manchester ===\n\nIn 2008 the Royal Opera House and Manchester City Council began planning stages a new development known as Royal Opera House, Manchester. The proposal would have seen the Palace Theatre in Manchester refurbished, to create a theatre capable of staging productions by both the Royal Ballet and the Royal Opera. It was intended that the Royal Opera House would take residence of the theatre for an annual 18-week season, staging 16 performances by the Royal Opera, 28 performances by the Royal Ballet and other small-scale productions. A year later The Lowry sent an open letter to the then Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, Ben Bradshaw, Arts Council England, Manchester City Council and the ROH, calling for the scheme, in its current form, to be scrapped. In 2010 it was announced that the project was being shelved as part of larger arts-funding cuts.\n\n\n=== High House Production Park (High House, Purfleet) ===\n\nThe Royal Opera House opened a scenery-making facility for their operas and ballets at High House, Purfleet, Essex, on 6 December 2010. The building was designed by Nicholas Hare Architects. The East of England Development Agency, which partly funded developments on the park, notes that \"the first phase includes the Royal Opera House's Bob and Tamar Manoukian Production Workshop and Community areas\".\nThe Bob and Tamar Manoukian Costume Centre, also designed by Nicholas Hare Associates, opened in September 2015, and provides a costume-making facility for the Royal Opera House and a training centre for students of costume-making from South Essex College. The building also houses the Royal Opera House's collection of historically important costumes.\nOther elements at High House, Purfleet, include The Backstage Centre, a new technical theatre and music training centre which is currently run by the National College for Creative Industries and was formally opened by Creative & Cultural Skills in March 2013, alongside renovated farm buildings. Acme studios opened a complex of 43 artist studios in Summer 2013.\n\n\n== Other uses ==\nIn addition to opera and ballet performances, the Royal Opera House has hosted a number of other events including:\n\nBritish Academy Film Awards â 2008 to 2016\nLaurence Olivier Awards â 2012 to 2016\n\n\n== See also ==\nOwners, lessees and managers of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden\nEuropean Route of Historic Theatres\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Cited sources ===\nBanham, Martin (1995).

    "wikipediaText": "St Paul's Church is a Church of England parish church located in Bedford Street, Covent Garden, central London. It was designed by Inigo Jones as part of a commission for the 4th Earl of Bedford in 1631 to create \"houses and buildings fit for the habitations of Gentlemen and men of ability\". Initially serving as an auxiliary chapel for the St. Martin-in-the-Fields parish, it was raised to a parish church with a dedication to Saint Paul in 1646, as the Covent Garden district expanded. The church is nicknamed \"the actors' church\" by a long association with the theatre community, particularly in the West End.  \nCompleted in 1633, St Paul's was the first entirely new church to be built in London since the Reformation. Its design and the layout of the square have been attributed to Inigo Jones since the 17th century, although firm documentary evidence is lacking. According to an often repeated story, recorded by Horace Walpole, Lord Bedford asked Jones to design a simple church \"not much better than a barn\", to which the architect replied \"Then you shall have the handsomest barn in England\".\n\nJones's design closely follows the description of an Etruscan-style temple by Ancient Roman architect Vitruvius, which  reflects the early forms of Roman temple. These essentially continued Etruscan architecture, though quite what Vitruvius intended by his account has divided modern scholars. The building is described by Sir John Summerson as \"a study in the strictly Vitruvian Tuscan Order\" and \"almost an archaeological exercise\". It has been seen as a work of deliberate primitivism: the Tuscan order having been associated by Renaissance architect Palladio with agricultural buildings.\nThe temple front with a portico on the square has never in fact been the main entrance, although this may have been Jones's first intention. The altar lies behind this wall, and the entrance is at the far end to this. The stone facing of this facade is also later; originally it was apparently brick with stucco.  The other sides of the building remain brick, with details in stone. The triangular pediments at both ends are in wood.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1630, the 4th Earl of Bedford was given permission to demolish buildings on an area of land he owned north of the Strand, and redevelop it. The result was the Covent Garden Piazza, the first formal square in London. The new buildings were classical in character. At the west end was a church, linked to two identical houses. The south side was left open.\nWork on the church was completed in 1633, at a cost to the Bedford estate of Â£4,886, but it was not consecrated until 1638 due to a dispute between the earl and the vicar of St Martin-in-the-Fields. It remained a chapel within the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields until January 1646, when Covent Garden was made a separate parish and the church dedicated to St. Paul.\nIn 1789 there was a major restoration of the church, under the direction of the architect Thomas Hardwick. Six years later, in September 1795, the church was burnt out by a fire, accidentally started by workmen on the roof. A survey of the damage found that the outer walls were still structurally sound, but that the portico would have to be reconstructed. It is unclear whether this was in fact done. Having been restored once more, again under Hardwick's supervision, the church was reconsecrated on 1 August 1798. Despite the destruction, the parish records were saved, as was the pulpit â the work of Grinling Gibbons.\nThe puritan Thomas Manton ministered from the pulpit of St Paul's until the Great Ejection. On 23 September 1662 Simon Patrick, later Bishop of Ely, was preferred to the rectory of St. Paul's where he served during the plague.\nThe first known victim of the 1665â1666 outbreak of the Plague in England, Margaret Ponteous, was buried in the churchyard on 12 April 1665.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe east end, facing the piazza, is now faced in stone, with a massive portico, its boldly-projecting pediment supported by two columns and two piers. There were originally three doorways behind the portico; the middle one, which survives, was built as a false door as the interior wall behind it is occupied by the altar. The other two were blocked up in the 19th century, when the chancel floor was raised. The main entrance to the church is through the plainer west front, which has a pediment, but no portico. William Prynne, writing in 1638 said that it was originally intended to have the altar at the west end, but pressure from the church hierarchy led to the imposition of the traditional orientation.\nThe earliest existing detailed description, dating from 1708, says that the exterior was not of bare brick, but rendered with stucco. In 1789 it was decided to case the walls in Portland stone as part of a major programme of renovation, which Thomas Hardwick was chosen to supervise. At the same time the tiled roof was replaced with slate, the dormer windows, added in the 1640s, were removed, and the archways flanking the church, originally of stuccoed brick, were replaced with stone replicas. When Hardwick's stone facing was removed from the church in 1888, it was found to be a thin covering less than three inches thick, poorly bonded to the brick. The building was then reclad in the present unrendered red brick.\nThere were originally six or seven steps leading up to the portico, but these disappeared as the level of the Piazza was raised gradually over the years. By 1823 there were only two steps visible, and none by 1887. The arches at the side of the portico were substantially widened and raised during a restoration of 1878â82 by Henry Clutton, The 9th Duke of Bedford's architect. Clutton also removed the bell-turret over the western pediment.\nThe interior is a single space, undivided by piers or columns. The eastern third was originally marked out as a chancel by means of the floor being raised by one step. The level was raised further during alterations by William Butterfield in 1871â72. The church was built without galleries, but they were soon added on three sides. Hardwick included them in his rebuilding, and the western one remains today.\nTo the sides of the portico there were two elaborate pedimented gateways to the churchyard that were removed, then replaced, continuing the \"Tuscan\" style. Plans and historical images show a variety of relatively small structures rising from the roof, some shown housing bells. The roof is now completely bare, and two bells can be seen in recesses cut high on the western facade.\nThe portico was a great inspiration for Roger Morris (1695â1749) when designing the stable block for Althorp House, Northamptonshire, which is believed to have been built between 1732 and 1733. In the Palladian style and constructed of local ironstone, the east and north sides of the stables feature the deep porticos, both of which face the house. Many architectural historians have expressed the view that the stables are of more architectural importance than the house itself, which is rather more plain in comparison as a result of many centuries of alterations, including a major exterior renovation by Henry Holland (1745-1806) in the 1790s.\n\n\n== Theatrical connections ==\nSt Paul's connection with the theatre began as early as 1663 with the establishment of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and was further assured in 1723 with the opening of Covent Garden Theatre, now the Royal Opera House.\nOn 9 May 1662, Samuel Pepys noted in his diary the first \"Italian puppet play\" under the porticoâthe first recorded performance of \"Punch and Judy\", a fact commemorated by the annual MayFayre service in May.\nThe portico of St Paul's was the setting for the first scene of Shaw's Pygmalion, the play that was later adapted as My Fair Lady.  Since 2007 St Paul's has been home to its own in-house professional theatre company, Iris Theatre, originally created to mount a production of T. S. Eliot's Murder in the Cathedral. It gained full charitable status in October 2009.\n\n\n== Baptisms, burials and memorials ==\nThe artist J. M. W. Turner and dramatist Sir William S. Gilbert (of Gilbert and Sullivan fame) were both baptised at St Paul's.\nSamuel Butler (1613â1680), of Hudibras fame, was buried at St Paul's, Covent Garden. Aubrey in Brief Lives describes his grave as \"being in the north part next to the church at the east end ... 2 yards distant from the pillaster of the dore\". His grave was never marked. A monument to him was placed in Westminster Abbey in 1732 by a printer with the surname Barber, and the Lord Mayor of London.\n\nAmong others also buried at St Paul's, Covent Garden, are the wood-carver Grinling Gibbons, the painters Thomas Murray, Sir Peter Lely, and Thomas Girtin, Thomas Arne (composer of \"Rule Britannia\"), and Sir Henry Herbert who as Master of the Revels to James I and Charles I was a censor of the theatre. A memorial tablet in the church commemorates Charles Macklin, the great Shakespearean actor from Ulster. The ashes of Dames Ellen Terry and Edith Evans rest in St Paul's. \nMemorials in the church are dedicated to many famous entertainment personalities of the 20th century, including Sir Charlie Chaplin, Sir NoÃ«l Coward, Dame Gracie Fields, Stanley Holloway, Boris Karloff, Vivien Leigh, Ivor Novello, Richard Greene, Diana Rigg, and Richard Beckinsale. The Avenue of Stars, which commemorated many notable figures and groups from the entertainment industry, formerly passed outside the church. There is also a memorial plaque to music hall star Bransby Williams which was unveiled by Sir Michael Redgrave.\nThe church is surrounded by an award-winning graveyard garden. The churchyard closed to burials in 1852.\n\n\n== Notable events ==\nIn the 1980s, the site directly outside the church was where the then Greater London Council, soon to be abolished, liked to showcase bands, as part of its \"Street Performers\" policy for using public open spaces, and the Council then controlled the Covent Garden Piazza. On Sunday, 1 April 1984, the first samba school in Britain, the London School of Samba (LSS), performed its first ever public concert on this site. Its second concert, on Saturday, 7 April 1984, also took place outside the church. The LSS had been formed on 31 January 1984 and was considered to be the Madrinha, or \"godmother\", of samba in the United Kingdom. Later in 1984, the LSS was also the first school of samba to parade in the Notting Hill Carnival.\nJohn Whitworth, a professor at the Guildhall School of Music, was organist of the church from 1965 to 1971.\n\n\n== Orchestra ==\nCovent Garden Sinfonia (known as the Orchestra of St Paul's until June 2017) is a professional chamber orchestra resident at the Actors' Church. In addition to a concert series in Covent Garden, the orchestra gives performances all around the UK and makes regular visits to the Southbank Centre, Cadogan Hall and St John's, Smith Square. Based around a core of principal players, Covent Garden Sinfonia adapts to each project, ranging in size from a small ensemble to a full symphony orchestra of 70 or more. The orchestra's Artistic Director is Ben Palmer and its patron is Sir Roger Norrington.\n\n\n== Rectors of St Paul's, Covent Garden ==\n\nâ  Rector died in post\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBerdmore Compton\nList of churches and cathedrals of London\nCrown Court Church â located nearby\nSaint Malachy's Roman Catholic Church, New York City, also known as the Actors' Church\nSt. Lawrence's Church, Mereworth â partly modelled on this church.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSt Paul's, Covent Garden entry from the Survey of London\nMystery Worshipper Report at the Ship of Fools website\nCovent Garden Sinfonia\nActors' Church\nDeanery of Westminster (St Margaret)[usurped]"

Commissioned by Cardinal Vaughan: built 1895-1903 to the designs of J F Bentley; consecrated 1910; interior fitting-out continued by John A Marshall of Bentley's office. Red brick, Portland stone bandings and dressings on Cornish granite plinth, with concrete foundations and vaults. Saucer domes of brick and concrete, three over nave and one over sanctuary. Narthex flanked by baptistery and porch, aisled 3-bay nave with 4 aisle chapels to (liturgical) north and three to south, where western one is subsituted by base of 284ft campanile; narrow two-bay transepts beyond which the apsed choir and sanctuary is flanked by apsed and aisled chapels. Sacristry to rear.\nFree Byzantine style. Complex west facade stepping forward in lower stages with central entrance in semi-circular arch with decorative voussoirs, columned jambs and mosaic by Robert Anning Bell in tympanum and sculptured medallions of 12 Archbishops of Canterbury. Blind round-arched arcading to upper tier, flanked by polygonal towers with corner buttresses supporting domes. Two-storey wings to either side with round-arched arcading and plate tracery. Further domes over the polygonal corner turrets to the banded bulk of the nave. Square campanile with polygonal buttressing at top supporting cupola. Side elevations with Diocletian\nwindows, paired round-arched and plate traceried windows divided by angular buttresses in each bay; these rise behind flat roof from less moulded ground-floor aisles, and similarly the gabled transepts are shallowly moulded. Sanctuary towers are polygonal with shallow, blind arcading and onion domes over corner buttresses. Three-bay sacristry with Diocletian windows to ground floor, round-arched lancets above. \nThe interior has never been completed, yet is magnificent - the nave for its volume and (especially) the chapels for their wealth of enrichment, most of it mosaic in keeping with Bentley's intention and much of it to his design. The walls lined with veined marble in cream and green to springer level. The brickwork above left rough for future mosaics where not yet installed. Narthex, for which Bentley left complete designs, with columns of Norwegian granite\nand marble floor. Organ by Henry Willis and Sons over. Nave has broad galleries over aisles, supported at the centre of each bay by paired monolithic columns, the Carrara marble capital of each being a different design. Stations of the Cross by Eric Gill, 1913-18. Pulpit remodelled and enlarged 1934 by L H Shattock. Rood by Christian Symons. Statue of St Peter copied from that at St Peter's, Rome, c.1900. Pendant lights of 1909.\nAisle chapels separated by further single columns of rare marble. The Chapel of the Holy Souls completed to Bentley's fully worked out designs, in black and white marble and with carefully overseen mosaics by Christian Symons 1902-3. Altarpiece shows Christ enthroned. Marble floor 1906, bronze gilt grille 1908.\nChapel of St George and the English Martyrs, also developed as a war memorial from 1915; largely designed by Marshall with altarpiece by Eric Gill, 1946. Figure of St George by Lindsay Clarke. Shrine to St John Southworth (1592-1654), reintered here in 1930. Apsed chapel of St Joseph with fine altar by Marshall, and monolithic panels of c.1992.\nOn south side, from the west the baptistery, with font by Bentley. Statue of St John the Baptist. Marble screen and steps lead to the Chapel of St Gregory and St Augustine, with altarpiece by Henry Holliday set into design by Bentley (drawn up in detail by him and which he later simplified) with mosaics by Clayton and Bell 1902-4. Chapel of St Patrick and the Saints of Ireland, clad in Irish marbles with memorials to the Irish regiments of 1914-18, designed by Marshall in the 1920s; the altar also by him, 1910; statue of St Patrick by Arthur Pollen. The\ngreen hue of this chapel is in contrast to the blue and white of the neighbouring Chapel of St Andrew and the Scottish Saints, the gift of Lord Bute and the work of R Weir Schultz 1910-14. Lean openwork screens of white metal by W Bainbridge Reynolds; sculpture by Stirling Lee, stalls by Ernest Gimson (considered amongst his finest works) with kneelers by Sidney Barnsley, reliquary by Harold Stabler and altar cards by Graily Hewitt. Chapel of St Paul similar to Marshall's work for that to St Joseph, 1913-17.\nTransepts with doors and confessionals by Bentley and Marshall, the latter a standard design for the Cathedral also found in St Patrick's Chapel and elsewhere. Mosaic of St Joan of 1909-12 by Christian Symons in north transept, where also is the Chapel of St Thomas of Canterbury - the Vaughan Chantry. Effigy of Cardinal Vaughan by Marshall and carved by Henry McCarthy; Marshall's also the marble and mosaic decoration, as designed by him in 1907.\nSanctuary has marble and jasper arcades supporting arcaded tribune above. High altar of Cornish granite, with baldacchino of Veronese marble on marble floor, designed by Bentley in 1901 and executed by Farmer and Brindley in 1905-6. Bas relief by Lindsay Clark; mosaic in tympanum over high altar by Gilbert Pownall, of Christ in Glory. Fittings by Marshall, 1908-10. Sacristy to rear not seen. Crypt under sanctuary dedicated to St Peter, with tombs to Cardinal Wiseman\nby Edward Welby Pugin and to Cardinal Manning by Bentley (but only partly carried out) and mosaics by Christian Symons. Bentley left designs for the marble work.\nThe northernmost of the aisles to the apsed chapels either side of the Sanctuary forms the Shrine of the Sacred Heart and St Michael. Black Panderma marble installed by Farmer and Brindley with contrasting white marbles and rosso antiquo highlights; mosaic of the Holy Face the last work of Christian Symons, 1910. Alabaster statue of the Sacred Heart by Farmer and Brindley and bas relief of St Michael on altar frontal completed by 1919. Silver lamp before the statue\nby Osmond Bentley and J A Marshall, who also designed the electric light pendants.\nLinked by screens is the Blessed Sacrament Chapel, marble clad between 1904 and 1909, enclosed by grilles and gates 1907 by Marshall, above which is represented the 'Pelican in her Piety'. Altar rail 1908, tabernacle and suspended canopy 1909, all by Marshall. Mosaics by Boris Anrep, completed in 1962.  -\nThe Lady Chapel is clad in richly-coloured rare marbles, completed c.1914.

The shrine is dedicated to the Blood of Jesus Christ and is the seat of the Archbishop of Westminster.\nThe original site on which the cathedral stands in the City of Westminster was purchased by the Diocese of Westminster in 1885, and construction was completed in 1903. Designed by John Francis Bentley in a 9th-century Christian neo-Byzantine style, and accordingly made almost entirely of brick, without steel reinforcements, Sir John Betjeman called it \"a masterpiece in striped brick and stone\" that shows \"the good craftsman has no need of steel or concrete.\"\nThe cathedral merited an Apostolic Visit from Pope John Paul II on 28 May 1982 and Pope Benedict XVI in 18 September 2010. \n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Roman Catholic Church's hierarchy had only recently been restored in England and Wales, and it was in memory of Cardinal Wiseman (who died in 1865, and was the first Archbishop of Westminster from 1850) that the first substantial sum of money was raised for the new cathedral. The land was acquired in 1884 by Wiseman's successor, Cardinal Manning, having previously been occupied by the second Tothill Fields Bridewell prison.\nAfter two false starts, in 1867 (under architect Henry Clutton) and 1892 (architect Baron von Herstel), construction started in 1895 under Manning's successor, the third archbishop, Cardinal Vaughan, with John Francis Bentley as architect, in a style heavily influenced by Byzantine architecture. The cost of the building was anticipated at Â£150,000 and its area 54,000 sq ft, the cathedral to be 350 ft long by 156 ft wide by 90 ft high.\nThe foundation stone blessing by Cardinal Vaughan took place on a Saturday morning, 29 June 1895, before a \"distinguished\" gathering. After the \"recitation of the Litanies, Cardinal Logue celebrated Low Mass coram episcopo. A procession composed of Benedictines, Franciscans, Jesuits, Passionists, Dominicans, Redemptorists, and secular clergy made the circuit of the grounds. The choir, directed by the Rev. Charles Cox, rendered, among other pieces, Webbe's 'O Roma Felix' and 'O Salutaris'. At the luncheon which followed, the speakers included Cardinal Vaughan, Cardinal Logue, the Duke of Norfolk, Lord Acton, Henry Matthews MP, Lord Edmund Talbot, and Sir Donald Macfarlane.\"\nThe cathedral opened in 1903, a year after Bentley's death. One of the first public liturgies to be celebrated in the cathedral was Cardinal Vaughan's Requiem Mass; the Cardinal died on 19 June 1903. When the debt on the building fund was liquidated, consecration ceremony took place on 28 June 1910 Under the laws of the Catholic Church, no place of worship could be consecrated unless free from debt. \nThe decoration of the interior had hardly been started at the time of consecration, as the decoration in Byzantine churches is applied, rather than integral to the architecture. Therefore finishing the decoration of the cathedral was left to the subsequent generations. It is an architectural gem with its interior notable for rich marble decorations and the beautiful, but still incomplete, mosaics.\nIn 1895, the cathedral was dedicated to the Most Precious Blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ. This is commemorated  by the Latin dedication above the portal tympanum:\n\n Latin: Domine Jesus Rex et Redemptor per Sanguinem tuum salva nos \n(English: \"Lord Jesus, King and Redeemer, save us through your blood\"). \nThe Feast of the Dedication of the Cathedral is celebrated each year on 1 July, which from 1849 until the Second Vatican Council (1969) was the feast of the Most Precious Blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ.\nThe additional coâpatrons are the Blessed Virgin Mary, Saint Joseph, Saint  Peter, Saint Augustine of Canterbury, Saint Patrick, along with  all remaining Catholic saints of Britain and Ireland.\nIn 1977, as part of her Silver Jubilee Celebrations, Queen Elizabeth II visited the cathedral to view a flower show.\nOn 28 May 1982, the first day of his six-day pastoral visit to the United Kingdom, Pope John Paul II celebrated Holy Mass in the cathedral.\nOn Saint Andrew's Day, 30 November  1995, at the invitation of Basil Cardinal Hume, Queen Elizabeth again visited the cathedral but this time she attended Choral Vespers, the first participation of the Queen in a Roman Catholic church liturgy in Great Britain.\nOn 18 September 2010, on the third day of his four-day state visit to the United Kingdom, Pope Benedict XVI celebrated Mass in the cathedral.\nIn January 2011 the cathedral was the venue for the reception and later ordination of three former Anglican bishops into the newly formed Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham.\nIn 2012, the cathedral was the host of two episodes of the BBC Four three-part documentary series named Catholics: the first episode looked at women who attend and/or work at the cathedral and their faith, and the third episode looked at the men training to become priests at Allen Hall seminary, and in the episode was a brief scene of their ordination at the cathedral.\nIn May 2021, during the Covid Pandemic and the banning of public mass, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds were wed at the Cathedral.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nWestminster Cathedral is the 50th largest church in the world in terms of interior area (5,017mÂ²), seating up to 2,000 people. It is the 38th largest Catholic church globally in terms of interior area.\nThe whole building, in the neo-Byzantine style, covers a floor area of about 5,017 square metres (54,000 sq ft); the dominating factor of the scheme, apart from the campanile, being a spacious and uninterrupted nave, 18 metres (59 ft) wide and 70 metres (230 ft) long from the narthex to the sanctuary steps, covered with domical vaulting.\nIn planning the nave, a system of supports was adopted not unlike that to be seen in most Gothic cathedrals, where huge, yet narrow, buttresses are projected at intervals, and stiffened by transverse walls, arcading and vaulting. Unlike in a Gothic cathedral, at Westminster they are limited to the interior. The main piers and transverse arches that support the domes divide the nave into three bays, each about 395 square metres (4,250 sq ft). The domes rest on the arches at a height of 27 metres (89 ft) from the floor, the total internal height being 34 metres (112 ft).\nIn selecting the pendentive type of dome, of shallow concavity, for the main roofing, weight and pressure have been reduced to a minimum. The domes and pendentures are formed of concrete, and as extraneous roofs of timber were dispensed with, it was necessary to provide a thin independent outer shell of impervious stone. The concrete flat roofing around the domes is covered with asphalt. The sanctuary is essentially Byzantine in its system of construction. The extensions that open out on all sides make the corona of the dome seem independent of support.\nThe eastern termination of the cathedral suggests the Romanesque, or Lombardic style of Northern Italy. The crypt with openings into the sanctuary, thus closely following the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio, Milan, the open colonnade under the eaves, the timber roof following the curve of the apex, are all familiar features. The large buttresses resist the pressure of a vault 14.5-metre (48 ft) in span. Although the cruciform plan is not very noticeable inside the building, it is emphasised outside by the boldly projecting transepts. These with their twin gables, slated roofs, and square turrets with pyramidal stone cappings suggest a Norman prototype in striking contrast to the rest of the design.\nThe main structural parts of the building are of brick and concrete, the latter material being used for the vaulting and domes of graduated thickness and complicated curve. Following Byzantine tradition, the interior was designed with a view to the application of marble and mosaic. Throughout the exterior, the lavish introduction of white stone bands in connection with the red brickwork (itself quite common in the immediate area) produces an impression quite foreign to the British eye. The bricks were hand-moulded and delivered by Faversham Brickfields at Faversham in Kent and Thomas Lawrence Brickworks in Bracknell. The main entrance faÃ§ade owes its composition, in a measure, to accident rather than design. The most prominent feature of the faÃ§ade is the deeply recessed arch over the central entrance, flanked by tribunes, and stairway turrets. The elevation on the north, with a length of nearly 91.5 metres (300 ft) contrasted with the vertical lines of the campanile and the transepts, is most impressive. It rests on a continuous and plain basement of granite, and only above the flat roofing of the chapels does the structure assume a varied outline.\nMarble columns, with capitals of Byzantine type, support the galleries and other subsidiary parts of the building. The marble selected for the columns was, in some instances, obtained from formations quarried by the ancient Romans, chiefly in Greece.\n\n\n=== High altar ===\nThe central feature of the decoration in the cathedral is the baldacchino over the high altar. This is one of the largest structures of its kind, the total width being 9.5 metres (31 ft), and the height 11.5 metres (38 ft). The upper part of white marble is richly inlaid with coloured marbles, lapis lazuli, pearl, and gold. Eight columns of yellow marble, from Verona, support the baldacchino over the high altar, and others, white and pink, from Norway, support the organ galleries.\nBehind the baldacchino the crypt emerges above the floor of the sanctuary, and the podium thus formed is broken in the middle by the steps that lead up to the retro-choir. The curved wall of the crypt is lined with narrow slabs of green carystran marble. Opening out of this crypt is a smaller chamber, directly under the high altar. Here are laid the remains of the first two Archbishops of Westminster, Cardinal Wiseman and Cardinal Manning. The altar and relics of Saint Edmund of Canterbury occupy a recess on the south side of the chamber. The little chapel of Saint Thomas of Canterbury, entered from the north transept, is used as a chantry for Cardinal Vaughan. A large Byzantine style crucifix, suspended from the sanctuary arch, dominates the nave.\n\n\n=== Chapels ===\nThe chapel of the Blessed Sacrament, on the north side of the sanctuary, and the Lady Chapel on the south, are entered from the transepts; they are 6.7 m (22 ft) wide, lofty, with open arcades, barrel vaulting, and apsidal ends. Over the altar of the Blessed Sacrament chapel a small baldacchino is suspended from the vault, and the chapel is enclosed with bronze grilles and gates through which people may enter. In the Lady Chapel the walls are clad in marble and the altar reredos is a mosaic of the Virgin and Child, surrounded by a white marble frame. The conches of the chapel contain predominantly blue mosaics of the Old Testament prophets Daniel, Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel. Unlike the Blessed Sacrament chapel, the chapel dedicated to the Blessed Mother is completely open. The building of the Lady Chapel was funded by Baroness Weld in memory of her second husband.\nThose chapels which may be entered from the aisles of the nave are also 6.7 metres (22 ft) wide, and roofed with simple barrel vaulting. The chapel of Saints Gregory and Augustine, next to the baptistery, from which it is separated by an open screen of marble, was the first to have its decoration completed. The marble lining of the piers rises to the springing level of the vaulting and this level has determined the height of the altar reredos, and of the screen opposite. On the side wall, under the windows, the marble dado rises to but little more than half this height. From the cornices the mosaic decoration begins on the walls and vault. This general arrangement applies to all the chapels yet each has its own distinct artistic character. Thus, in sharp contrast to the chapel dedicated to St. Gregory and St. Augustine which contains vibrant mosaics, the chapel of the Holy Souls employs a more subdued, almost funereal style, decoration with late Victorian on a background of silver.\nAs in many Catholic churches, there are the Stations of the Cross to be found along the outer aisles. The ones at Westminster Cathedral are by the sculptor Eric Gill, and are considered to be amongst the finest examples of his work.\n\n\n== Mosaics ==\nWhen the cathedral's architect John Bentley died, there were no completed mosaics in the cathedral and Bentley left behind precious little in terms of sketches and designs. Consequently, the subject and styles of the mosaics were influenced by donors as well as designers, overseen by a cathedral committee established for this purpose. Indeed, Bentley's influence is, in reality, only seen in the chapel dedicated to the Holy Souls. Due to the prevailing absence of any real designs by Bentley, there was no real agreement as to how the mosaics should look, and in one instance, works already installed (in the Sacred Heart shrine) were removed after the death of the artist, George Bridge.\nMosaics installed during the period 1912â1916 were mostly done by devotees of the Arts and Crafts Movement. Those in the Lady Chapel were installed by the experienced mosaicist Gertrude Martin (who had worked with George Bridge), in 1912â1913. The work was supervised by Anning Bell and Marshall, who later designed the mosaic of Christ enthroned which is above the entrance to the cathedral. The Tympanum of the portal shows in a Byzantine mosaic technique from left to right the kneeling St Peter with the Keys of Heaven, the Virgin Mary, Jesus Christ as Pantocrator on the throne, St Joseph, the Nursing Father of Jesus with a lily in his right hand, and in a kneeling position the canonized English King Edward the Confessor in royal regalia. As Jesus Christ blesses the viewer with his right hand, he holds in his left hand the Book of Life. The Latin inscription of the opened book pages reads: Ego sum ostium per me si quis introierit salvabitur (I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved; Gospel of John 10,9).\nThe mosaics in the chapel dedicated to Saint Andrew, paid for by The 4th Marquess of Bute, also belong to work of the Arts and Craft Movement.\nThe five-year period 1930 to 1935 saw a tremendous amount of work done, with mosaics placed in the Lady Chapel, in the alcoves above the confessionals, in the crypt dedicated to Saint Peter, and on the sanctuary arch.\nNo new mosaics were installed until 1950 when one depicting St ThÃ©rÃ¨se of Lisieux (later replaced by a bronze) was placed in the south transept and another, in 1952, in memory of those in the Royal Army Medical Corps who died in World War II, in the chapel of Saint George. From 1960 to 1962, the Blessed Sacrament Chapel was decorated in a traditional, early Christian style, with the mosaics being predominantly pale pink in order to afford a sense of light and space. The designer, Boris Anrep, chose various Eucharistic themes such as the sacrifice of Abel, the hospitality of Abraham and the gathering of the manna in the wilderness, as well as the Feeding the multitude and the Wedding Feast at Cana. In his old age, Anrep also acted as adviser and principal sketch artist for the mosaics installed in the chapel of Saint Paul (1964â1965). These mosaics depict various moments in the life of Paul; his occupation as a tent-maker, his conversion to Christ, the shipwreck on Malta and his eventual execution in Rome.\nIt was not until the visit of Pope John Paul II in 1982 that the next mosaic was installed above the north-west entrance. Rather than a scene, this mosaic is an inscription: Porta sis ostium pacificum per eum qui se ostium appellavit, Jesus Christum (May this door be the gate of peace through Him who called Himself the gate, Jesus Christ). In 1999, the mosaic of Saint Patrick, holding a shamrock and a pastoral staff as well as trampling on a snake, was installed at the entrance to the chapel in his honour. In 2001, a striking mosaic of Saint Alban, strongly influenced by the style of early Byzantine iconography, was installed by the designer, Christopher Hobbs. Due to the very favourable reception of the work, Hobbs was commissioned for further mosaics: the chapel to Saint Joseph which contains mosaics of the Holy Family (2003) and men working on Westminster Cathedral (2006). Hobbs also did the chapel in honour of Saint Thomas Becket illustrating the saint standing in front of the old Canterbury Cathedral on the chapel's east wall and the murder of Thomas on the west wall. The vault is decorated with a design of flowers, tendrils and roundels (2006). As of 2011, there were plans for further mosaics, including depictions of Saint Francis of Assisi and Saint Anthony in the narthex.\n\n\n== Music ==\nDespite its relatively short history compared to other English cathedrals, Westminster has a distinguished choral tradition. It has its origin in the shared vision of Cardinal Vaughan, the cathedral's founder, and Sir Richard Runciman Terry, its inaugural Master of Music. Terry prepared his choristers for a year before their first sung service in public. For the remainder of his tenure (until 1924) he pursued a celebrated revival of great quantities of Latin repertoire from the English Renaissance, most of which had lain unsung ever since the Reformation. Students at the Royal College of Music who would become household names were introduced to their heritage when Charles Villiers Stanford sent them to the cathedral to hear \"polyphony for a penny\" (the bus fare). This programme also required honing the boys' sight-reading ability to a then-unprecedented standard.\nThe choir has commissioned many works from distinguished composers, many of whom are better known for their contribution to Anglican music, such as Benjamin Britten and Ralph Vaughan Williams. However, the choir is particularly renowned for its performance of Gregorian chant and polyphony of the Renaissance.\nUnlike most other English cathedrals, Westminster does not have a separate quire; instead, the choir are hidden from view in the apse behind the high altar. This, with the excellent acoustic of the cathedral building, contributes to its distinctive sound.\nLocated in the west gallery, the Grand Organ of four manuals and 81 stops occupies a more commanding position than many British cathedral organs enjoy. Built by Henry Willis III from 1922 to 1932, it remains one of the most successful and admired.  One of Louis Vierne's best-known organ pieces, \"Carillon de Westminster\", the final movement from Suite no. 3 (op. 54) of PiÃ¨ces de Fantaisie, was originally improvised on it in 1924, and the subsequent 1927 published version is dedicated to Willis.\nThe apse organ of fifteen stops was built in 1910 by Lewis & Co. Although the Grand Organ has its own attached console, a console in the apse can play both instruments.\nOn 3 May 1902, some 3,000 people attended a concert of sacred music in the cathedral, organised to raise money for the Choir School and to test the acoustics in the building. The music was provided by an orchestra of a hundred and a choir of two hundred, including the Cathedral Choir, directed by Richard Terry.  The programme included music by Wagner, Purcell, Beethoven, Palestrina, Byrd and Tallis. The acoustics proved to be excellent. One year later, on 6 June 1903, the first performance in London of The Dream of Gerontius, a poem by Cardinal John Henry Newman, set to music by Edward Elgar, took place in the cathedral. The composer himself conducted, with Richard Terry at the organ.  Once again, the proceeds went to support the Cathedral Choir School.\nJohn Tavener's The Beautiful Names, a setting of the 99 names of Allah found in the Qur'an, premiÃ¨red in the cathedral on 19 June 2007, in a performance by the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus in the presence of Charles, Prince of Wales.\n\n\n== Choir ==\nThe founder of Westminster Cathedral, Cardinal Herbert Vaughan laid great emphasis on the beauty and integrity of the cathedral's liturgy. Initially, he determined there should be a community of Benedictine monks at the new cathedral, performing the liturgies and singing the daily Office. This caused great resentment amongst the secular clergy of the diocese, who felt they were being snubbed. In the end, negotiations with both the English Benedictines and the community of French Benedictines at Farnborough failed and a traditional choir of men and boys was set up instead. Despite great financial problems, the Choir School opened on 5 October 1901 with eleven boy choristers, in the building originally intended for the monks. Cardinal Vaughan received the boys with the words \"You are the foundation stones\". The Cathedral Choir was officially instituted three months later in January 1902. Sung Masses and Offices were immediately established when the cathedral opened for worship in 1903, and have continued without interruption ever since.\nIn September 2020, Cardinal Vincent Nichols responded to a strategic review of sacred music at Westminster Cathedral, asking that \"all those who profess to be fervent supporters of this precious inheritance of sacred music to become regular contributors to its financial support. It is, unquestionably, time to look ahead in order to ensure that this tradition of sacred music in Westminster Cathedral...can be put onto a firm footing for years to come.\"\nWhen the question of a musical director was first considered, the choice fell on the singer Sir Charles Santley, who had conducted the choir of the pro-cathedral in Kensington on several occasions. But Santley knew his limitations and refused. Richard Runciman TerryâDirector of Music at Downside Abbey Schoolâthen became the first director of music of Westminster Cathedral. It proved to be an inspired choice. Terry was both a brilliant choir trainer and a pioneering scholar, one of the first musicologists to revive the great works of the English and other European Renaissance composers. Terry built Westminster Cathedral Choir's reputation on performances of musicâby Byrd, Tallis, Taverner, Palestrina and Victoria, among othersâthat had not been heard since the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and Mass at the cathedral was soon attended by inquisitive musicians as well as the faithful. The performance of great Renaissance Masses and motets in their proper liturgical context remains the cornerstone of the choir's activity.\nTerry resigned in 1924, and was succeeded by Canon Lancelot Long who had been one of the original eleven choristers in 1901.\nAt the beginning of the Second World War, the boys were at first evacuated to Uckfield in East Sussex, but eventually the choir school was closed altogether for the remainder of the war. The music at the cathedral was performed by a reduced body of professional men singers. During this period, from 1941 to 1947, the Master of Music was William Hyde, who had been the sub-organist under Richard Terry.\nHyde was succeeded by George Malcolm, who developed the continental sound of the choir and consolidated its musical reputationâin particular through the now legendary recording of Victoria's Tenebrae responsories. More recent holders of the post have included Francis Cameron, Colin Mawby, Stephen Cleobury, David Hill, James O'Donnell and Martin Baker. In May 2021, Simon Johnson was appointed as the Master of Music.\nIn addition to its performances of Renaissance masterpieces, Westminster Cathedral Choir has given many first performances of music written especially for it by contemporary composers. Terry gave the premiÃ¨res of music by Vaughan Williams (whose Mass in G minor received its liturgical performance at a Mass in the cathedral), Gustav Holst, Herbert Howells and Charles Wood; in 1959 Benjamin Britten wrote his Missa brevis for the choristers; and since 1960 works by Lennox Berkeley, William Mathias, Colin Mawby and Francis Grier have been added to the repertoire. Most recently four new Massesâby Roxanna Panufnik, James MacMillan, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies and Judith Binghamâhave received their first performance in the cathedral. In June 2005 the choristers performed the world premiÃ¨re of Sir John Tavener's Missa Brevis for boys' voices.\nWestminster Cathedral Choir made its first recording in 1907. Many more have followed in the Westminster Cathedral Choir discography, most recently the series on the Hyperion label, and many awards have been conferred on the choir's recordings. Of these the most prestigious are the 1998 Gramophone Awards for both Best Choral Recording of the Year and Record of the Year, for the performance of Martin's Mass for Double Choir and Pizzetti's Requiem, conducted by O'Donnell. It is the only cathedral choir to have won in either of these categories.\nWhen its duties at the cathedral permit, the choir also gives concert performances both at home and abroad. It has appeared at many important festivals, including Aldeburgh, Cheltenham, Salzburg, Copenhagen, Bremen and Spitalfields. It has appeared in many of the major concert halls of Britain, including the Royal Festival Hall, the Wigmore Hall and the Royal Albert Hall. The cathedral choir also broadcasts frequently on radio and television.\nWestminster Cathedral Choir has undertaken a number of international tours, including visits to Hungary, Germany and the US. The choristers participated in the 2003 and 2006 International Gregorian chant Festival in Watou, Belgium, and the full choir performed twice at the Oslo International Church Music Festival in March 2006. In April 2005, 2007 and 2008 they performed as part of the \"Due Organi in Concerto\" festival in Milan. In October 2011, they sang the inaugural concert of the Institute for Sacred Music at Saint John's in Minnesota.\nThe cathedral is frequently referred to as the 'Drome'. This dates from the early 20th century days when the Lay Clerks were represented by Equityâthe trade union for actors and variety artists. In the profession, it was jokingly referred to as 'The Westminster Hippodrome'âa nickname which was later shortened to the 'Drome'.\n\n\n== Oremus magazine ==\nWestminster Cathedral has published a monthly magazine since 1896, before the building work was completed. The latest in a series of titles is Oremus, which first appeared in 1996. (The Latin word oremus translates into English as \"Let us pray\".) Oremus is a 32-page colour magazine, which contains features and articles by well-known members of the Catholic community, as well as non-Catholic commentators and leading figures within British society. It is the successor of titles such as the Westminster Cathedral Record, selling at 6d per copy from January 1896, the Westminster Cathedral Chronicle, a monthly, available from January 1907 at 2d a copy or 3/- a year, post paid, and the Westminster Cathedral Bulletin, first published in 1974. Dylan Parry, who edited the magazine between 2012 and August 2016, took the decision to make Oremus a free publication in 2013. The magazine is also available to download via Westminster Cathedral's website.\n\n\n== Burials ==\nIn order of years of office:\n\nRichard Challoner (1691â1781) Vicar Apostolic of the London District (Re-interred in the cathedral 1946)\nNicholas Wiseman (28 September 1850 â 15 February 1865) First Archbishop of Westminster upon the re-establishment of the Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales in 1850.

It was founded in 1799 by the leading British scientists of the age, including Henry Cavendish and its first president, George Finch. Its foundational principles were diffusing the knowledge of, and facilitating the general introduction of useful mechanical inventions and improvements, as well as enhancing the application of science to the common purposes of life (including through teaching, courses of philosophical lectures, and experiments). \n\nMuch of the Institution's initial funding and the initial proposal for its founding were given by the Society for Bettering the Conditions and Improving the Comforts of the Poor, under the guidance of philanthropist Sir Thomas Bernard and American-born British scientist Sir Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford. Since its founding it has been based at 21 Albemarle Street in Mayfair. Its Royal Charter was granted in 1800.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Royal Institution was founded as the result of a proposal by Sir Benjamin Thompson (Count Rumford) for the \"formation by Subscription, in the Metropolis of the British Empire, of a Public Institution for diffusing the Knowledge and facilitating the general Introduction of useful Mechanical Inventions and Improvements, and for the teaching by courses of Philosophical Lectures and Experiments, the application of Science to the Common Purposes of Life\".\nRumford's proposal led to a 7 March 1799 meeting at the house of Joseph Banks, then president of the Royal Society, a similar but much older learned society.  A follow-up meeting on 9 March saw the first meeting of the managers of the Institution.  In June of that year, the society elected George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea as its first president, and in July it purchased the 21 Albemarle Street, Mayfair building that has served as its home ever since. Renovations began immediately on the building to provide appropriate meeting, office, and laboratory space for the Institution's mission.\nThe first Professor and Public Lecturer in Experimental Philosophy, Mechanics and Chemistry was Dr Thomas Garnett, whom Rumford poached from the newly founded Andersonian Institute in Glasgow in October 1799.\nThe steep-sided main lecture hall that has become the building's most publicly visible feature, as the home of its Christmas lectures, was completed in 1800, the same year that the institution received its royal charter from George III.  The lecture hall was put to use immediately; the first lecture given in it was by Garnett in March 1800.\n\nThroughout its history, the Institution has supported public engagement with science through a programme of lectures, many of which continue today. The most famous of these are the annual Royal Institution Christmas Lectures, founded by Michael Faraday in 1825.\nDespite Garnett's first lectures being a great success, his salary was frozen, he was not allowed to practise as a doctor, and Humphry Davy was appointed as his assistant, so he resigned. Humphry Davy was an even greater success, as was his assistant and successor Michael Faraday. Davy's immediate successor was William Thomas Brande.\nThus the Institution has had an instrumental role in the advancement of science since its founding. Notable scientists who have worked there include Sir Humphry Davy (who discovered sodium and potassium), Michael Faraday, James Dewar, Sir William Henry Bragg and Sir William Lawrence Bragg (winners of the Nobel Prize for Physics for their work on x-ray diffraction), Max Perutz, John Kendrew, Antony Hewish, and George Porter.\nIn the 19th century, Faraday at the Royal Institution carried out much of the research which laid the groundwork for the practical exploitation of electricity. In total fifteen scientists attached to the Royal Institution have won Nobel Prizes. Ten chemical elements including sodium were discovered there; the electric generator was devised at the Institution, and much of the early work on the atomic structure of crystals was carried out within it.\nThe Royal Institution was founded during the age of slavery, and one of its major supporters was John Fuller, whose fortune derived from two Jamaican plantations. Fuller contributed more than Â£10,000 to the institution, including endowing two professorships; Michael Faraday was the first Fullerian Professor of Chemistry. In contemporary times, use of the Fullerian title has been discontinued, and the two chairs will no longer be filled.\n\n\n=== Nobel laureates ===\n\n\n=== Chemical elements discovered or isolated ===\n\n\n=== Past presidents ===\n\n\n=== Past directors ===\n\nThe leadership of the Royal Institution has had various titles:\n\nDirector of the Laboratory\nDirector of the Davy-Faraday Research Laboratory\nDirector\nThe position was abolished in 2010, with the firing of Susan Greenfield.\nThe position was restored in April 2017 with the appointment of Sarah Harper, Professor of Gerontology at the University of Oxford. Harper resigned in September 2017.\nThe present director is Katherine Mathieson.\n\n\n=== Andrade controversy ===\nIn 1952, Edward Andrade was forced to resign following a complicated controversy over the management of the Royal Institution and his powers as director, involving a power struggle with Alexander Rankine who was secretary. Following various resignations and general meetings of members, Andrade was awarded Â£7,000 by arbitration: the arbitrators blamed the problems on \"a lack of clear definition of roles ... an outdated constitution, and the inability of the protagonists to compromise\". Andrade launched a lawsuit to set the arbitration aside, which he lost.\n\n\n=== Director Greenfield firing ===\nFrom 1998 to 8 January 2010, the director of the Royal Institution was Baroness Susan Greenfield, but following a review, the position was abolished for being \"no longer affordable\". The Royal Institution had found itself in a financial crisis following a Â£22 million development programme led by Greenfield, which included refurbishment of the institution's main Albemarle Street building, and the addition of a restaurant and bar with an aim to turn the venue into a \"Groucho club for science\". The project ended Â£3 million in debt.\nGreenfield subsequently announced that she would be suing for discrimination.\nThe RI's official statement stated it would \"continue to deliver its main charitable objectives under the direction of chief executive officer, Chris Rofe and a talented senior team including Professor Quentin Pankhurst, the Director of the Davy-Faraday Research Laboratory, Dr Gail Cardew, the Head of Programmes and Professor Frank James, Head of Collections and Heritage.\" Baroness Greenfield later dropped the discrimination case.\n\n\n== Current organisation ==\n\nToday the Royal Institution is committed to \"diffusing science for the common purposes of life\". Membership is open to all, with no nomination procedure or academic requirements, on payment of an annual subscription.\nThe Institution's patrons and trustees include:\n\nPatron: Vacant (most recently Charles while he was the Prince of Wales)\nPresident: The Duke of Kent\nHonorary Vice-President: Sir John Ritblat\nChairman: Sir Richard Catlow\nBoard of Trustees (current): Sophie Forgan, Simon Godwin, Kate Hamilton, Suze Kundu, Renato Lulia, the Baroness Morris of Yardley, Vincent Nobel, Christopher Potter, Angela Seddon, Jack Stilgoe, Harriet Wallace, Allison Wollard\nIn December 2021, the Institution appointed Katherine Mathieson as Director. In July 2018, the institution announced a new five-year strategy running from October 2018 to September 2023. The strategy, which sets out to double the charity's size, involves \"plans for new research, development of a new national science club and open forum public policy debates\". One new venture will be a Research Centre for Science and Culture, working with other academic groups, this \"will investigate historical and contemporary examples of the relationship between science and culture\".\nThe institution's palatial home has been greatly enlarged and redeveloped since 1799, and is a Grade I listed building. The structure's last refurbishment was a Â£22 million project completed in 2008, intended to create a \"science salon\" for the public. As well as the famous Lecture Theatre, the building contains several function rooms, modern research facilities and a public cafÃ©. The trustees were considering selling the building in an effort to recoup the organisation's debts, which amounted to Â£7 million. In 2013 The Ri received an anonymous donation of Â£4.4m and as of January 2016, the Ri is now debt-free.\n\nThe institution (which it now abbreviates as 'Ri', though third parties often prefer 'RI') has a substantial public science programme and science for schools programme, holding over one hundred events per year on a wide variety of topics. The Christmas Lectures continue today as a series of three televised lectures aimed at children. The Friday Evening Discourses are monthly lectures given by eminent scientists, each limited to exactly one hour, a tradition started by Faraday. There is an annual members' ballot for tickets to the Christmas Lectures but all other events are open to the public. Discounts or free tickets are available to Ri Patrons and Members. Many other events and lectures are held both at Albemarle Street and at other venues around the country.\nScientific research headed by Professor Quentin Pankhurst continues to be done under the auspices of the Davy-Faraday Research Laboratory (DFRL), and indeed this is considered to be one of the UK's most notable labs in nano-science.\nIn May 2015, The Royal Institution was host to the historic unveiling of the Santara Computer, created by Dr Andrew Deonarine.\nIn November 2015 a new membership scheme was launched and Fellows of the Ri were abolished. The new scheme includes the categories Member, Under 26 and Ri Young Member. Adult Members have voting rights and use of MRi as post-nominal letters. A Patrons' scheme has also been introduced for the first time.\nIn December 2011 the Royal Institution launched the Ri Channel, a new website displaying science videos and archive content from the Royal Institution, including past Christmas Lectures. The Ri Channel was archived in late 2017 with all Ri videos except past Christmas Lectures being hosted on YouTube. Past Christmas Lectures are hosted on the Ri's website and in early 2018 the Ri began a to upload all past Christmas Lectures that were not already available on its website.\nThe Royal Institution has become a mixed tenancy office building that hosts conferences, weddings and events in order to pay its bills. In 2015 it sold part of its historic collection of manuscripts to raise funds. Since 2021, the researchers of the London Institute for Mathematical Sciences have been tenants on the second floor. They occupy rooms that were once the private living quarters of Michael Faraday, where they carry out their research in theoretical physics and mathematics.\n\n\n== Faraday Museum ==\n\nIn 1973 the Royal Institution opened the Faraday Museum, a museum dedicated to Michael Faraday. It is in the main building in Albemarle Street and is open to the public during weekday office hours. The highlight of the exhibition is Faraday's original 1850s laboratory (not a reconstruction as often cited). Opposite this lab is the current state-of-the-art nanotechnology lab.  Other exhibits include the discoveries, people and activities of the Royal Institution.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website of the Royal Institution of Great Britain\nThe Science Media Centre\nRoyal Institution's YouTube Channel\nJames, Frank A.

Brown brick, slate roof.  4 storeys, basement and dormered mansard.  4\nwindows wide.  The entrance porch to left is a convincing Adamesque addition of\nc.1906, enclosed and stone faced with lower cornice carried in over doorhead, the\nfrieze with putti-panel and roundels over slender Ionic columned jambs of doorway\nwith archivolt arched fanlight, roundels inspandrels beneath crowning cornice.\nGround floor windows semicircular arched, gauged flat arches to upper floors,\nrecessed glazing bar sashes.  1st floor plat band, bracketed main cornice over 2nd\nfloor and crowning cornice and blocking couse. Bowed wrought iron balconettes\nadded to 1st floor c.1906.  Wrought iron area railings.  The interior retains\nalmost complete Adam scheme, with some neo-Adam alterations by the firm of\nHindley and Wilkinson in 1906.  Adam provided the rear wing to create 2 grand\nreception rooms on the ground and 1st floors, replanned the staircase creating the\npresent oblong compartment (the stairs themselves of 1906) and there are Adam\ndesigns for the ceilings of the 3 main 1st floor rooms and the staircase, of\nwhich the latter, the rear room and the grand room in the wing survive; drawings\nalso for some of the painted door panels in the main drawing room; ground floor\ngrand room in wing has Tuscan column screens; wall decoration consists predominantly\nof painted arabesques and grotesques to shallow pilasters, friezes \"al'antico\" etc. \nFront ground floor room retains features of Timbrell's original interior such\nas cornice and chimney piece, etc.  Adam was working forHume at Hill Street at\nthe same time as he was decorating Hume's country house at Wormleybury.  Hindley\nand Wilkinson are probably responsible for the 1st floor front room ceiling,\nand they remodelled the hall at the same time as the stairs.\nThere are some 50 drawings for 17 Hill Street in the Soane Museum.\nThe English Interior; Arthur Stratton\nCountry Life; March 17th, 1917\nListing NGR: TQ2862380490\n        \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n    \n        Legacy\n    \n    \n        The contents of this record have been generated from a legacy data system.\n    \n    \n        \n            Legacy System number:\n            \n                210178\n            \n        \n        \n            Legacy System:\n            \n                LBS\n            \n        \n    \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n                    Sources\n                \n                \n                    Books and journalsStratton,  A, The English Interior'Country Life' in 17 March, (1917)\n                \n\n\n\n                    \n                        \n\n\n    \n        Legal\n    \n\n\n    \n        This building is listed under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as amended for its special architectural or historic interest.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n\n            \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n            \n                Map\n            \n            \n                This map is for quick reference purposes only and may not be to scale.

    "wikipediaText": "The Theatre Royal Haymarket (also known as Haymarket Theatre or the Little Theatre) is a West End theatre on Haymarket in the City of Westminster which dates back to 1720, making it the third-oldest London playhouse still in use. Samuel Foote acquired the lease in 1747, and in 1766 he gained a royal patent to play legitimate drama (meaning spoken drama, as opposed to opera, concerts or plays with music) in the summer months. The original building was a little further north in the same street. It has been at its current location since 1821, when it was redesigned by John Nash. It is a Grade I listed building, with a seating capacity of 888. The freehold of the theatre is owned by the Crown Estate.\nThe Haymarket has been the site of a significant innovation in theatre. In 1873, it was the venue for the first scheduled matinÃ©e performance, establishing a custom soon followed in theatres everywhere. Its managers have included Benjamin Nottingham Webster, John Baldwin Buckstone, Squire Bancroft, Cyril Maude, Herbert Beerbohm Tree, and John Sleeper Clarke, brother-in-law of John Wilkes Booth, who quit America after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Famous actors who dÃ©buted at the theatre included Robert William Elliston (1774â1831) and John Liston (1776â1846).\n\n\n== History of the theatre ==\n\n\n=== Origins and early years ===\nThe first Hay Market theatre was built in 1720 by John Potter, carpenter, on the site of The King's Head Inn in the Haymarket and a shop in Suffolk Street kept by Isaac Bliburgh, a gunsmith, and known by the sign of the Cannon and Musket. It was the third public theatre opened in the West End. The theatre cost Â£1000 to build, with a further Â£500 expended on decorations, scenery and costumes. It opened on 29 December 1720, with a French play La Fille a la Morte, ou le Badeaut de Paris performed by a company later known as The French Comedians of His Grace the Duke of Montague. Potter's speculation was known as The New French Theatre. Its name was changed to Little Theatre in the Hay.\n\nThe theatre's first major success was a 1729 production of a play by Samuel Johnson of Cheshire, Hurlothrumbo, or The Supernatural, which ran for 30 nights â not as long as John Gay's The Beggar's Opera (62 performances), but still a long run for the time. In 1730, the theatre was taken over by an English company. Among the actors who appeared there before 1737 when the theatre was closed under the Licensing Act 1737 were Aaron Hill, Theophilus Cibber, and Henry Fielding. In the eight to ten years before the Act was passed, the Haymarket was an alternative to John Rich's Theatre Royal, Covent Garden and the opera-dominated Drury Lane Theatre. Fielding himself was responsible for the instigation of the Act, having produced a play called The Historical Register that parodied prime minister Robert Walpole, as the caricature, Quidam.\nIn particular, it was an alternative to the pantomime and special-effects dominated stages, and it presented opposition (Tory party) satire. Henry Fielding staged his plays at the Haymarket, and so did Henry Carey. Hurlothrumbo was just one of his plays in that series of anti-Walpolean satires, followed by Tom Thumb. Another, in 1734, was his mock-opera, The Dragon of Wantley, with music by John Frederick Lampe. This work punctured the vacuous operatic conventions and pointed a satirical barb at Walpole and his taxation policies. The piece was a huge success, with a record-setting run of 69 performances in its first season. The work debuted at the Haymarket Theatre, where its coded attack on Walpole would have been clear, but its long run occurred after it moved to Covent Garden, which had a much greater capacity for staging. The burlesque itself is very brief on the page, as it relied extensively on absurd theatrics, dances, and other non-textual entertainments. The Musical Entertainer from 1739 contains engravings showing how the staging was performed.\nCarey continued with Pasquin and others. Additionally, refugees from Drury Lane's and Covent Garden's internal struggles would show up at the Haymarket, and thus Charlotte Charke would act there in a parody of her father, Colley Cibber, one of the owners and managers of Drury Lane. The Theatrical Licensing Act, however, put an end to the anti-ministry satires, and it all but entirely shut down the theatre. From 1741 to 1747, Charles Macklin, Cibber, Samuel Foote, and others sometimes produced plays there either by use of a temporary licence or by subterfuge; one advertisement runs, \"At Cibber's Academy in the Haymarket, will be a Concert, after which, will be exhibited (gratis) a Rehearsal, in the form of a Play, called Romeo and Juliet.\"\nIn 1749 a hoaxer billed as The Bottle Conjuror was advertised to appear at the theatre. The conjuror's publicity claimed that, while on stage, he would place his body inside an empty wine bottle, in full view of the audience. When the advertised act failed to appear on stage, the audience rioted and gutted the theatre. Although the identity of the hoax's perpetrator is unknown, several authors consider John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu, to have been responsible.\n\n\n=== London's third patent theatre ===\n\nIn 1754, John Potter, who had been rated (i.e. paid property tax) for the theatre since its opening, was succeeded by John Whitehead. In 1758 Theophilus Cibber obtained from William Howard, then the Lord Chamberlain, a general licence under which Foote tried to establish the Haymarket as a regular theatre. With the aid of the Duke of York he procured a royal licence to exhibit plays during four months in each year from May to September during his lifetime. He also bought the lease of the theatre from Potter's executors and, having added to the site by purchasing adjoining property, he enlarged and improved the building which he opened on 14 May 1767, as the Theatre Royal, the third patent theatre in London. Several successful seasons followed, with Foote producing numerous plays at the theatre, but Foote finally got himself into difficulties by his custom of caricaturing well-known persons on the stage and this, combined with increasing ill-health, resulted in his selling both the theatre and patent to George Colman Sr. on 16 January 1777.\nDuring the season of 1793â94 when Drury Lane Theatre was being rebuilt, the Haymarket was opened under the Drury Lane Patent. The season was notable for a 'Dreadful Accident' which occurred on 3 February 1794, 'when Twenty Persons unfortunately lost their lives, and a great Number were dreadfully bruised owing to a great Crowd pressing to see his Majesty, who was that Evening present at the Performance.' Amongst the dead were John Charles Brooke, Somerset Herald and Benjamin Pingo York Herald. Colman died in 1794, and the theatre descended to his son. George Colman Jr., though successful both as playwright and manager, dissipated his gains by his extravagance. For a time he lived in a room at the back of the theatre and he was finally forced to sell shares in the latter to his brother-in-law, David Morris. Monetary difficulties increased and for a while Colman managed the theatre from the King's Bench Prison, where he was confined for debt.\nAll the buildings on the east of the Haymarket from the theatre southward were rebuilt circa 1820 in connection with John Nash's schemes for the improvement of the neighbourhood. Nash persuaded the proprietors of the theatre to rebuild on a site a little south of the old one so that the portico should close the vista from Charles Street. The main front feature of Nash's elevation in the Haymarket was (and is) a pedimented portico of six Corinthian columns which extends in depth to the edge of the pavement and includes the whole frontage. It is sometimes stated that Nash rebuilt the theatre entirely, but there is evidence that he incorporated a house in Little Suffolk Street with the theatre, removed two shops which were in front, in the Haymarket, built a portico, increased the number of avenues and added a second gallery to the existing auditorium.\nA lease dated 10 June 1821, was granted to David Edward Morris. The theatre was opened on 4 July 1821, with The Rivals. Benjamin Nottingham Webster became the theatre's manager from 1837 to 1853. He and his successor, John Baldwin Buckstone, established the theatre as a great comedy house, and the theatre hosted most of the great actors of the period. The illusionist Ching Lau Lauro performed here on 25 July 1827.\n\n\n=== The latter half of the 19th century ===\nIn 1862, the theatre was host to a 400-night run of Our American Cousin, with Edward Sothern as Lord Dundreary. The play's success brought the word \"dreary\" into common use. Robertson's David Garrick was a hit in 1864, also with Sothern in the title role. Sothern also starred in H. J. Byron's An English Gentleman at the theatre in 1871. W. S. Gilbert premiered seven of his plays at the Haymarket. The first was his early burlesque, Robinson Crusoe; or, The Injun Bride and the Injured Wife (1867, written with Byron, Tom Hood, H. S. Leigh and Arthur Sketchley). Gilbert followed this with a number of his blank verse \"fairy comedies\", the first of which was The Palace of Truth (1870), produced by Buckstone. These starred William Hunter Kendal and his wife Madge Robertson Kendal and also included Pygmalion and Galatea (1871), and The Wicked World (1873). Gilbert also produced here his dramas, Charity (1874), Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith (1876), and his most famous play outside of his Savoy operas, Engaged, an 1877 farce. Buckstone's ghost has reportedly often been seen at the theatre, particularly during comedies and \"when he appreciates things\" playing there. In 2009, The Daily Telegraph reported that the actor Patrick Stewart saw the ghost standing in the wings during a performance of Waiting for Godot at the Haymarket. In May 1875, Arthur Sullivan's The Zoo transferred to the Haymarket.\n\nIn 1879 the house was taken over by the Bancrofts, who re-opened the theatre with a revival of Edward Bulwer-Lytton's Money, followed by Victorien Sardou's Odette (for which they engaged Madame Helena Modjeska) and Fedora, and Arthur Wing Pinero's Lords and Commons, with other revivals of previous successes. The auditorium had been reconstructed, and the stage enclosed in a complete picture frame proscenium, the first in London. The abolition of the pit by the introduction of stalls seating divided by plain iron arms caused the opening night play, Money, on 31 January 1880, to be delayed for half an hour while the audience in the galleries expressed their anger. Mr. Bancroft, in the character of Sir Frederick Blount, vainly endeavoured to pacify them, until he bluntly asked whether the play should proceed and thus obtained silence. The Bancrofts gave up management of the theatre in 1885.\nThe next season opened in September 1885. Herbert Beerbohm Tree became manager of the theatre and, in 1887, transferred The Red Lamp there from the Comedy Theatre; by then he had installed electric light in the theatre. Under Tree's management, Oscar Wilde premiered his comedy A Woman of No Importance in April 1893. In January 1895 Wilde's An Ideal Husband was first performed at the theatre. Tree's next notable hit was George du Maurier's Trilby, later in 1895. This ran for over 260 performances and made such profits that Tree was able to build Her Majesty's Theatre and establish RADA.\nIn 1896 Cyril Maude and Frederick Harrison became lessees, opening with Under the Red Robe, an adaptation of Stanley Wyman's novel. In 1897 The Little Minister by J. M. Barrie ran for 320 performances.\n\n\n=== The 20th century ===\n\n\n==== 1900 to 1950 ====\nThe Haymarket's managers Frederick Harrison (who was sole lessee) and Cyril Maude remained through the first year of the 20th century. In 1904, the auditorium was redesigned in Louis XVI style by C. Stanley Peach. The following year, Maude acquired the Playhouse Theatre by Charing Cross Station, leaving Harrison in sole control. In 1909, Herbert Trench produced Maurice Maeterlinck's The Blue Bird. Productions from then to the end of World War I included Bunty Pulls the Strings (1911), a Scottish comedy by Graham Moffat, which ran for 617 performances with Jimmy Finlayson in the lead; Ibsen's Ghosts (1914); Elegant Edward, with Henry Daniell as P. C. Hodson (1915); The Widow's Might (1916), a comedy by Leonard Huskinson and Christopher Sandeman, with Henry Daniell. and General Post, a comedy by J. E. Harold Terry, which opened on 14 March 1917 and ran for 532 performances, again with Daniell.\n\nIn 1920, J. M. Barrie's Mary Rose had a run of 399 performances. Another long-running production was Yellow Sands, in which Ralph Richardson gave 610 performances in 1926â27. In 1926 Harrison died, and Horace Watson became the theatre's General Manager. His presentations included 632 performances of The First Mrs Fraser, by St. John Ervine, starring Marie Tempest in 1929. In 1939, under Watson's management, work began on excavating a stalls bar, but it was not completed until 1941 owing to the outbreak of World War II. Wartime presentations included the London premiere of NoÃ«l Coward's Design for Living (1939) and John Gielgud's 1944â1945 repertory season of The Circle (Somerset Maugham), Love for Love (Congreve), Hamlet, A Midsummer Night's Dream and The Duchess of Malfi.\nIn 1940, Gielgud directed The Beggar's Opera, with Michael Redgrave as Macheath. In 1943, two Coward plays, Present Laughter and This Happy Breed, alternated. They were followed in 1945 by Wilde's Lady Windermere's Fan and in 1948 by Tennessee Williams's The Glass Menagerie directed by Gielgud, starring Helen Hayes; and The Heiress, an adaptation of Henry James's Washington Square, directed by Gielgud and starring Ralph Richardson and Peggy Ashcroft, who were succeeded by Godfrey Tearle and Wendy Hiller (1949â50).\n\n\n==== 1950â80 ====\nIn 1951â52 Waters of the Moon by N. C. Hunter starred Sybil Thorndike, Edith Evans and Wendy Hiller. For the Coronation season in 1953, Coward gave a rare performance in a play not written by him, The Apple Cart by George Bernard Shaw, with Margaret Leighton as his co-star. To Coward, the Haymarket was \"the most perfect theatre in the world\". In 1956, Stuart Watson, who had taken over management of the theatre from his father Horace, died and was succeeded by his son Anthony, and then his daughter-in-law Sylva Stuart Watson, who took over in 1963. Productions under the new management included Flowering Cherry by Robert Bolt (1957) starring Ralph Richardson and Celia Johnson; Ross by Terence Rattigan (1960) starring Alec Guinness; and John Gielgud's production of The School for Scandal (1962), with Ralph Richardson and Margaret Rutherford. In the 1960s, notable presentations included The Tulip Bee by N. C. Hunter starring Celia Johnson and John Clements and Thornton Wilder's Ides of March directed by Gielgud (both 1963).\nIn 1971, Louis I. Michaels became the lessee of the theatre. Productions of the decade included a revival of Enid Bagnold's The Chalk Garden, with Gladys Cooper (1971, which had played at the Haymarket in 1956â57); the long-running A Voyage Round My Father (John Mortimer) starring Alec Guinness, succeeded by Michael Redgrave (1971â72); and, in 1972, Crown Matrimonial by Royce Ryton, starring Wendy Hiller as Queen Mary. Later productions included a revival of On Approval (Frederick Lonsdale) with Geraldine McEwan and Edward Woodward (1975); The Circle, with Googie Withers and John McCallum (1976); Rosmersholm (Ibsen) with Claire Bloom and Daniel Massey (1977); The Millionairess (Shaw), with Penelope Keith; Waters of the Moon again, starring Hiller and Ingrid Bergman in her last stage role (both 1978); and Keith Michell and Susan Hampshire in The Crucifer of Blood (1979).\n\n\n==== 1980â2000 ====\nThe theatre then presented Make and Break (Michael Frayn), with Leonard Rossiter and Prunella Scales (1980). The following year, Louis Michaels died, and the theatre passed to a company, Louis I Michaels Ltd, with President, Enid Chanelle and Chairman, Arnold M Crook, which continued to own the theatre for decades. They presented Overheard, by Peter Ustinov; and Virginia, with Maggie Smith (1981). In 1982, the Haymarket staged a repertory season including Hobson's Choice, starring Penelope Keith; Captain Brassbound's Conversion (Shaw); Uncle Vanya (Chekhov); Rules of the Game (Luigi Pirandello); and Man and Superman (Shaw), starring Peter O'Toole. In 1983, productions included The School for Scandal, starring Donald Sinden; Heartbreak House (Shaw), starring Rex Harrison; Ben Kingsley in a one-man show about Edmund Kean; A Patriot for Me (John Osborne); The Cherry Orchard (Chekhov); and The Sleeping Prince (Terence Rattigan).\nProductions in 1984 were The Aspern Papers by Henry James, starring Christopher Reeve, Vanessa Redgrave and Wendy Hiller; Aren't We All? (Frederick Lonsdale) starring Rex Harrison and Claudette Colbert; and The Way of the World (Congreve). In 1985, Lauren Bacall starred in Sweet Bird of Youth (Tennessee Williams), followed by Harold Pinter's Old Times. In 1986 the theatre presented Antony and Cleopatra, starring Timothy Dalton and Vanessa Redgrave; Breaking the Code (Hugh Whitemore), starring Derek Jacobi as Alan Turing; Long Day's Journey into Night, starring Jack Lemmon; and The Apple Cart, starring Peter O'Toole. In 1988, another Tennessee Williams play, Orpheus Descending, starred Vanessa Redgrave. Later productions that year were You Never Can Tell (Shaw); The Deep Blue Sea (Rattigan); and The Admirable Crichton (J. M. Barrie). The 1980s ended at the Haymarket with Veterans' Day (Donald Freed) and A Life in the Theatre (David Mamet). In 1990, the Haymarket revived London Assurance (Dion Boucicault) and presented An Evening with Peter Ustinov. The next year's plays included Jean Anouilh's Becket, starring Derek Jacobi and Robert Lindsay. Lindsay also starred in a revival of Cyrano de Bergerac in 1992. This was succeeded by new productions of Heartbreak House with Vanessa Redgrave and A Woman of No Importance.\nIn 1994 the theatre closed for a Â£1.3 million refurbishment, re-opening later that year with a revival of An Evening with Peter Ustinov, followed by Arcadia (Tom Stoppard). Burning Blue (1995), a new play by the first time playwright David Greer, was followed by the veteran director Peter Hall's revival of Ibsen's The Master Builder, starring Alan Bates. Hall also directed the 1996 An Ideal Husband (Oscar Wilde) 100 years after its premiÃ¨re at the Haymarket; the new production featured Martin Shaw as Lord Goring. There is a memorial plaque to Wilde at the theatre.\nAnother production of 1996 was Neil Simon's The Odd Couple, starring Tony Randall and Jack Klugman. Hall was in charge again for the 1997 production of A Streetcar Named Desire (Tennessee Williams), starring Jessica Lange; Lady Windermere's Fan; and An Ideal Husband (returning after touring). The last production of that year was A Delicate Balance (Edward Albee), starring Eileen Atkins, Maggie Smith, John Standing and Annette Crosbie.\nIn 1998, Shakespeare's Villains a one-man play, created and performed by Steven Berkoff at the theatre was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Entertainment. Later that year, Tom Stoppard's The Invention of Love, starring John Wood, transferred from the National Theatre. In 1999, Fascinating AÃ¯da's comic revue was followed by Neil Simon's The Prisoner of Second Avenue, with Richard Dreyfuss and Marsha Mason; Love Letters, by A. R. Gurney, with Charlton Heston and a transfer of the Chichester Festival Theatre's The Importance of Being Earnest, starring Patricia Routledge.\n\n\n=== The 21st century ===\n\nProductions at the Haymarket in this century have included The Royal Family by Edna Ferber, starring Judi Dench (2001), Lady Windermere's Fan, directed by Peter Hall, starring Vanessa Redgrave and Joely Richardson (2002), and Dench appeared on stage together with Maggie Smith for the first time in over 40 years in The Breath of Life by David Hare (2002). Productions in 2003 included Ibsen's Brand, directed by Adrian Noble, starring Ralph Fiennes and A Woman of No Importance, with Rupert Graves, Samantha Bond and Prunella Scales, also directed by Noble. In 2004, the theatre presented a stage adaptation of the film, When Harry Met Sally..., starring Luke Perry and Alyson Hannigan, during which the house closed for two nights after bits of the ceiling fell during a performance injuring fifteen people.\n2005 productions included Victoria Wood's Acorn Antiques: The Musical, starring Julie Walters, Celia Imrie and Duncan Preston, directed by Trevor Nunn and A Few Good Men, starring Rob Lowe, Suranne Jones and Jack Ellis. 2006 featured three revivals: A Man for All Seasons, starring Martin Shaw; Coward's Hay Fever, with Judi Dench and Peter Bowles; and Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, starring Dave Willetts and Shona Lindsay. The last production of that year was Six Dance Lessons in Six Weeks, starring Claire Bloom and Billy Zane. The first production of 2007 was Pinter's People, a compilation of Harold Pinter sketches of the past 40 years; later productions of that year were The Lady from Dubuque (Albee), starring Maggie Smith; David Suchet in The Last Confession; and The Country Wife, starring Toby Stephens, Patricia Hodge and David Haig.\nIn 2008, productions were The Sea (Bond), starring David Haig, Eileen Atkins and Russell Tovey; Marguerite, a new musical starring Ruthie Henshall and Alexander Hanson; and Keith Allen in an adaptation of Treasure Island. The following year, Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart, Simon Callow and Ronald Pickup starred in Waiting for Godot, followed by Breakfast at Tiffany's, starring Anna Friel, Joseph Cross, James Dreyfus and Suzanne Bertish. Godot and Tiffany's were featured, along with the staff and history of the Haymarket Theatre itself, in a 2009 eight-part Sky Arts documentary, Theatreland. In 2010 Waiting for Godot was repeated with McKellen, Roger Rees, Matthew Kelly and Pickup, followed by a transfer of Sweet Charity from the Menier Chocolate Factory. The next show was The Rivals starring Penelope Keith and Peter Bowles.\nTrevor Nunn became Artistic Director 2011, producing a revival of Flare Path, as part of the playwright Terence Rattigan's centenary year celebrations, starring Sienna Miller, James Purefoy and Sheridan Smith; the Chichester Festival Theatre's revival of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead by Tom Stoppard; Ralph Fiennes as Prospero in The Tempest; and, over the Christmas/New Year season, Robert Lindsay and Joanna Lumley in The Lion in Winter. For two years from March 2012, the Haymarket hosted the National Theatre production One Man, Two Guvnors, which transferred from the Adelphi Theatre. The theatre was one of the 40 theatres featured in the 2012 DVD documentary series Great West End Theatres, presented by Donald Sinden.\nIn 2014, a stage adaptation of the film Fatal Attraction, directed by Nunn, premiered at the theatre, and Maureen Lipman and Harry Shearer starred in Daytona. The following year Penelope Wilton starred in Taken at Midnight. This was followed by Harvey, starring James Dreyfus and Maureen Lipman, and The Elephant Man, starring Bradley Cooper. McQueen, starring Stephen Wight, then transferred from the St. James Theatre, and was followed by Mr Foote's Other Leg, starring Simon Russell Beale as Samuel Foote.\nProductions in 2016 included a revival of Alan Ayckbourn's How the Other Half Loves, starring Nicholas Le Prevost, Jenny Seagrove, Tamzin Outhwaite and Jason Merrells, and Pixie Lott made her debut at the Haymarket as Holly Golightly in Breakfast at Tiffany's. In December the Royal Shakespeare Company took up residence at the Haymarket with a double bill of Love's Labour's Lost and Much Ado About Nothing. In 2017, Damian Lewis and Sophie Okonedo starred in Edward Albee's The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia? from March to June. The RSC then returned to the theatre with Queen Anne. Natalie Dormer and David Oakes later starred in Venus in Fur.\nIn 2018, Suranne Jones, Jason Watkins and Nina Sosanya starred in a revival of Frozen, a play by Bryony Lavery, followed by Heathers: The Musical starring Carrie Hope Fletcher. In 2019 Louis I. Michaels Ltd. sold the theatre to Access Entertainment for a reported Â£45 million. In February 2019, Only Fools and Horses The Musical premiered at the theatre. It closed at the end of April 2023 after over 1,000 performances, making it the longest-running show in the Haymarket's history, and was followed by a limited run of Accidental Death of an Anarchist starring Daniel Rigby. Noises Off starring Felicity Kendal began a limited run in September 2023.The Picture of Dorian Gray starring Sarah Snook followed in February 2024. A View from the Bridge starring Dominic West began playing in May 2024. It is expected to be followed by Waiting for Godot starring Lucian Msamati and Ben Whishaw from September 2024.\n\n\n== Masterclass ==\nIn 1998 the theatre founded Masterclass, a charity that offers creative opportunities and performing experiences to young people pursuing careers in the performing arts. Its activities include, in addition to masterclasses, apprenticeships in directing and theatre design, workshop productions, and theatre career fairs.

    "wikipediaText": "The House of St Barnabas, at 1 Greek Street,  Soho, is a Grade I Listed Georgian building in London notable for its rococo plasterwork interiors and for other architectural features.\nSince 1862 the House has been run as a charity to help those who have experienced homelessness. The name of the organisation was changed from the \"House of Charity\" to the \"House of St Barnabas\" in 1951. The building functioned as a hostel for women until 2006.\nThe not-for-profit members' club at The House of St Barnabas opened in October 2013 and closed in January 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn March 1679, Richard Frith and William Pym were developing Soho Square, then known as Fryths Square. A timber merchant, Cadogon Thomas of Lambeth, held a lease for a great corner house, coach house and stables. Aristocrats who lived in the Restoration house included the second Baron Crew, Lady Elizabeth Cavendish and the dowager Countess of Fingall but the longest residence was of William Archer MP from 1719 until 1738. By May 1742 the original house had been demolished; the new house was built between 1744 and 1747, but it remained unoccupied until the lease was sold to Richard Beckford (a member of a wealthy family of Jamaican plantation owners and brother to Alderman William Beckford) in October 1754.\nIt is likely that the elaborate rococo plasterwork was added by Richard Beckford.  Upon his death in 1756, the house was sold to Sir James Colebrooke with a conveyance stating that the previous owner had made some 'useful and ornamental furnishings'.\nIn 1811 the house ceased to be a residential property and was let to the Westminster Commissioners of Sewers, and its successor the Metropolitan Commission of Sewers after 1849. In 1856 the house was used by the Metropolitan Board of Works, and became the office of Sir Joseph William Bazalgette. It was during this time that the 19th century additions were made at the back of the house.\nResearch published in The Dickensian in 1963 suggests that the rooms and gardens of the House of St Barnabas were the blueprint for the imagined lodgings of Dr. Manette and Lucy in the novel A Tale of Two Cities  by Charles Dickens,  published in 1859 and set between the turmoil of Paris during the French Revolution and the comparative tranquillity of London. Subsequently, the road on which is the Chapel entrance was renamed Manette Street.\n\nIn a building at the back, attainable by a courtyard where a plane tree rustled its green leaves, church organs claimed to be made, and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant who had a golden arm starting out of the wall... as if he had beaten himself precious.  - A Tale of Two Cities, Charles Dickens\nThe 'golden arm' now resides at the Dickens House Museum but you can see a modern replica sticking out of the wall near the Pillars of Hercules pub at the western end of Manette Street (formerly Rose Street).\n\n\n=== Charitable work ===\nThe House of Charity, founded in 1846, moved from its home No. 9 Rose (now Manette) Street to the new premises at 1 Greek Street in 1861, which had been purchased for Â£6,400.\nBehind the House of Charity was an ideal of practical Christianity, spurred on by the Oxford Movement.  The first list of members included William Ewart Gladstone.\nOne of the original functions of the Charity was to keep families together when the husband of a  family went into a workhouse. Between January 1847 and February 1851, 487 people were admitted. Of these, 103 were families ranging from a single mother to a family of ten with both parents and eight children. These families were a typical example of the way in which the House of Charity set out \"to offer to those who are sunk in the depths of temporal, and frequently spiritual, wretchedness, the example of the discipline of a Christian family\".\nThe House of Charity described itself as one of the few institutions in London where men, women and children of all walks of life, were able to 'apply for aid without a loss of self-respect'.  Temporary guests of the house included 'all who found themselves in a condition of friendlessness and destitution that is not the manifest result of idleness or vice.' \n\n\n=== World War II and beyond ===\nBetween 1862 and the outbreak of World War II, the Charity broadened its functions and over the years helped the homeless of London in many different ways: it helped people who were emigrating to Australia and were awaiting the long sea journey, people who had to come to London for surgery in hospitals, servants who had lost their jobs, teachers between positions and Ã©migrÃ©s from Russia and the Balkans â an association which still continues to this day with the monthly services of the Macedonian community in the chapel.\nAfter the outbreak of World War II, during the blitz, the nuns moved back to Clewer and the house was requisitioned for war duty. In November 1940 a bomb fell on the house, causing sufficient damage though fortunately no fatalities. The Air Training Corps used the premises as a headquarters during the war, having first applied to repair the bomb damage sufficiently to allow use of the building. Following this, London County Council was granted use of the building for 'the purpose of training Students in Child Welfare'.\nAfter the war the house opened as a women's hostel, originally helping ex-service women, and at one time providing 'as many as 802 beds'. The hostel had many supporters and friends, among them Joyce Grenfell, the comic actress, who was a constant visitor and fundraiser. The house closed as a women's hostel in 2006. All the residents were re-housed.\nThe individual stories of the people who made the house their home over this long period are recorded in the house archives, which are now kept in the Westminster Archive. Then, as now, the charity was overseen by a board of trustees.\n\n\n=== Now ===\nThe House of St Barnabas has the vision \"to create a future where sustained employment is a reality for those affected by homelessness.\" It has been constituted as a members' club since 2013. The club hosts music and entertainment events, and also showcases visual art from established and emerging artists. The founding members of the club were Andrew Weatherall R.I.P., Gilles Peterson, Sav Remzi, Miranda Sawyer, Ekow Eshun, Brian Cox, Margot Bowon, Richard Strange, Rob Da Bank, Rankin, Hew Locke and Jarvis Cocker.\nIn July 2019 it was reported that the house was running a 12-week scheme in which participants work in the club, in hospitality and administrative roles, alongside attending workshops, before graduating with a City and Guilds qualification. Graduates are provided with a minimum of one year post-programme support to help them  back into lasting paid work and to help break the cycle of homelessness.\nAfter a ceiling collapse in July 2023, the club announced its permanent closure in January 2024.\n\n\n== The House ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== The Entrance Hall ===\nThe interior detail, the moulded plasterwork, is one of the finest examples of the English Rococo style surviving in London.  Whilst it is not known for sure who instigated this work, it is probable that Richard Beckford commissioned the additions to the House's interior.  Similarly, the designers of the elaborate plasterwork are thought to be George Fawkes and Humphrey Willmott, the plasterers employed at Mansion House at around the same date, though there is no solid evidence to support this.\nThe front door is original and the Charity still has the large key for the lock; 18th century London was a dangerous place, hence the enormous safety chain.\nThe simple decoration of the hall was a deliberate device to attract the visitor's eye to the decorated staircase leading to the rooms on the first floor.\nThe wrought-iron balustrades of the staircase are original. The original chandelier held candles and the mechanism for raising and lowering still exists. The Angel on the landing is the oldest object in the house. It dates from the 1600s, is made of wood and is Flemish.  This has been embellished by the artist Nancy Fouts.\nThere is a galleried landing from which the plasterwork can be viewed more closely: there is a deep relief of female busts, a lion's head and scrollwork. In Richard Beckford's time, the panels would almost certainly have held oil paintings,  probably of members of his large family.  Their places are now occupied by paintings by the artist Alan Rankle.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== The Soho & Dickens Rooms ===\nThe office for the Charity's Hostel Director and Personal Support Workers, who provided the one-to-one counselling, advice and support to the residents, was almost certainly the dining room, known as The Soho Room. This room, together with the Dickens room that leads from it, has plasterwork from the 1750s, although it is not quite as ornate as the decoration in the rooms above.\nThe Dickens Room has a fireplace with four roundel paintings of nuns, installed when the House of Charity moved into the buildings.\nThese rooms now hold the members' restaurant and private dining facilities.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== The Drawing Room ===\nThe ceiling of The Drawing Room has in its corners heads representing the Four Seasons. The central oval medallion shows four putti,  holding in their hands the symbols of the four classical elements: earth, water, fire and air.\nAt the top of the wall panel in the drawing room opposite the chimneypiece are two dragons made of papier-mÃ¢chÃ©. These are the dragons of the city of London which, as an alderman, William Beckford was permitted to use.  It is believed, although there is no concrete evidence, that the plasterers William used for Mansion House were engaged to plaster this, his brother Richard's house, as there are distinct similarities between the plasterwork, including the presence of the city of London dragons.\nWhen the House of Charity acquired the property three of the marble chimneypieces from the House, including the Council Room chimneypiece, were sold to fund the building of the chapel. The overmantel and chimney piece were designed as part of the restoration in 1960 by Lawrence King.\nThe Drawing Room is the largest member's lounge in the club.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== The Silk Room ===\nThe Silk Room is a silk-lined room which also has its original plasterwork ceiling and carved wooden chimneypiece. It is also called the Withdrawing Room, because in Georgian times it was the room that ladies would have withdrawn to.\nThe Silk Room is currently used as both a board room and private dining space.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== The Bazalgette Room ===\nAt the rear of the House, The Bazalgette Room was the principal bedroom. The chimneypiece and overmantel are original and the entrance door is matched by a  false door at the southern end of the same wall.  This was to give the room symmetry, but the plain plasterwork indicates that the room has been reduced in size to provide storage space for the Metropolitan Board of Works. The room takes its name from being the offices of the civil engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette, who designed London's sewage system. The House of Charity used the Bazalgette room to house its archives,  including all the records of those helped.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== The Library Bar ===\nThe Library has a Victorian fireplace with the badges of the House of Charity, inscribed with the Charity's founding date, 1846, and 1862, the date the Charity moved into the House.  Between the two badges is a text from the Gospel of Matthew \"I was a stranger and ye took me in\".\nThis is currently the club bar and central hub.\n\n\n=== The Monro & Garden Rooms ===\nThe Monro Room and the Garden Room were created by the Charity out of an extension devised by the Metropolitan Board of works on part of the site of the stables that complimented the Georgian House.\nA tavern clock about four feet high and made entirely of black lacquered wood with gold painted numbers hangs in the chapel corridor. The dial of these types of clocks was big and bold enabling them to be seen in dimly lit,  smoke filled taverns.  These clocks were also known as Act of Parliament clocks because they became popular after the British Parliament passed an Act in 1797 levying a tax on domestic clocks with the result that people relied on public clocks for their time-keeping.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== The Crinoline Stair ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== The Penny Chute ===\nOn the outside of the house is the Penny Chute attached to the railings in Soho Square.  Coins fall down the pipe to the alms box in the kitchen.  People today still donate to the Charity using this method.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== The Chapel ==\nThe chapel was built on the site of the Georgian stable yard between 1862 and 1864 by Edward Conder of Baltic Wharf, Kingsland Road. The architect was Joseph Clarke and the original plans for the site included a refectory with dormitories above and a cloister. The Annual Report of 1928 mentions that the plan of the Chapel \"was suggested and partly designed from the plans of a Romanesque chapel attached to the Abbey of Montmajeur, Arles, France.\"\nThe cost of building the chapel proved a financial strain to the Charity, and 'in 1864 three chimney pieces were sold from the House.'\nThe chapel is a reminder of the Anglo-Catholic revival in the Church of England spearheaded by men like Newman, Pusey and Keble who published the Tracts for the Times between 1833 and 1841, earning them the name Tractarians. Their followers not only emphasised Catholic aspects of the Church of England but also a return to medieval Gothic architecture after neo-classical churches of the previous two hundred years. In 1848, the then Bishop of London, Archibald Tait, became Visitor to the charity and his successors continue to hold this office. The original plan included a throne for the Bishop behind the altar but, in 1865, Joseph Clarke proposed the mosaics by Harland and Fisher. The advice and support of the Visitor provide a living link between the House of St Barnabas and the Church of England in the Diocese of London.\nDuring the Second World War, the original stained glass windows and roof of the Chapel suffered bomb damage. The apse above the altar was originally painted with the Passion of Christ and the windows commemorated the Charity's founders and supporters. The present windows behind the altar represent, from left to right, St Edward the Confessor; St Barnabas holding the Chapel in his arms; St Paul preaching and St John the Baptist holding the mother Chapel of Clewer in his arms; they were designed by John Hayward. The windows in the side apses, dating from 1958, represent the Stations of the Cross and the Annunciation. The organ was built by the firm of J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd in 1875 at a cost of Â£250 and was enlarged by them in 1884.  At the west end of the South West apse is a memorial to Captain Henry Norman who died in 1925. He became a porter of the House after retiring as first mate of the Cutty Sark, the tea clipper now at Greenwich.\nThe Chapel remains a sacred space for prayer and worship. Although it is an Anglican Chapel, currently there are Eastern Orthodox services for London's Macedonian Orthodox community and baptisms and services following civil weddings.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nThe House of St Barnabas, registered charity number 207242, at the Charity Commission"

By Isambard Kingdom Brunel (engineer), Sir Matthew Digby Wyatt (architect) and Sir Charles Fox (contractor), with assistance with the decoration by Owen Jones, for the Great Western Railway.  The fourth shed was designed in-house by the GWR's New Works Engineer, W Armstrong.  Added offices of 1881, early C20, 1933-4, c1965.  1930s work designed by PC Culverhouse, Chief Architect of the GWR.  1989-2001 restoration of the trainshed by Aukett Associates.  1999-2000 'Lawn' building by Nicholas Grimshaw and Partners.  EXTERIOR: The exterior of Paddington Station at the London end is completely hidden by the Great Western Royal Hotel (q.v.).  This leaves a street faÃ§ade to Eastbourne Terrace along the south-west and an office block and the 1914-16 trainshed along the north-east side.  The north-west, Bristol, end of the station is open.   Eastbourne Terrace Elevation: This elevation has buildings of several periods.  From the London (south-east) end: 7 bays of the hotel (1851-3); A: 18 bays of GWR offices (1930-36); B: 7 bays of GWR offices (1881); C: 1960s rebuilding of World War II bomb damage; D: 26 bays; E: 17 bays; F: 2 bays; G: 10 bays; H: 17 bays; (all GWR 1851-4 except F and G which are early C20).  They vary in storey height because of the falling ground and the depth of the cutting for the railway. A: Built in two phases in the 1930s with the eight bays nearest the hotel being the second build (completed in 1936). They share the same cornice and roof lines although other architectural details differ.  Probably designed by PC Culverhouse, Chief Architect of the GWR.  Six storeys with attic and basement. NB This building is partly or wholly in hotel use and a fuller description is given under the separate listing of the Great Western Royal Hotel (q.v.).   B: This seven bay building, probably of 1881, is incomplete as it abuts the bomb-damaged area on the left.  It has probably lost two bays.  Of four storeys and attics it is of Portland stone with a Welsh slate roof and would seem to be inspired by the Whitehall Banqueting House.  C: A glass and steel two-storey 1960s structure which fills the gap in B and D caused by a parachute mine in 1941. This is not of special interest.D: The next twenty-six bays are the survivors of a terrace of thirty-two bays, the right-hand end of which was lost in 1941.  Of three storeys with an attic said to have been added c1930. The terrace is rendered, apart from the attic storey which is brick with stucco dressings.  The first and second floors have had architectural detailing removed since World War II; chimneys have also gone.  The ground floor by contrast has elaborate Victorian stucco decoration designed by Matthew Digby Wyatt on what was the principal original entrance to the main departure platform, Booking Office, First-Class Waiting Room, and for Royalty on the way to Windsor.  To the front a light steel roof, post-World War II, over the cab-road (which also runs the length of C above).  The roof is supported on the street side by a panelled brick wall topped by rusticated stone piers and elaborate cast-iron railings. E: The next seventeen bays are set back but are otherwise much as D (above).  At the left-hand end the first six bays of the ground floor are obscured by a tented glass and iron porte-cochere with a ridge and furrow roof added in the early C20 (see F below).  F and G: This block, although of similar character, appears to have been built in the early C20. It is taller, with five storeys and attics, although the first two bays have only four floors.  H: The final section of the terrace, reaching nearly to Bishop's Bridge, is of four storeys, the uppermost probably added in the early 1930s.   The north elevation facing the cab-road and London Street: following the hotel and its 1930s extension is a six-storey office block of 1933, probably steel framed, faced in artificial 'Victoria Patent' stone.  This was designed by PC Culverhouse, Chief Architect of the GWR. The attic floor, which is blind, has giant Gill Sans bronze lettering G.W.R. PADDINGTON  G.W.R., the second G.W.R. being on the return.Opposite the station buildings is the panelled brick retaining wall of London Street, on the other side of the cab-road, which drops to the arched entrance of the span added to the 1854 trainshed in 1914-16.  The arch is glazed and carries the arms of the GWR on its crown.  The shed has a steel outside wall and is roofed in a patent tiling system with four glazed lights along the ridge. A metal-sheeted rail depot (in 2008 operated by Red Star) which forms the north-west corner of the station is not of special interest.  The structural deck beneath (fronting onto the raised section of London Street and covering the underground northernmost platforms) dating from 1906-14 is, however, of special interest and included in the listing.The north-west (Bristol) end of the station reveals the glazed ends of the four sheds, their roofs of corrugated steel sheeting, corrugated glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) and glazing (the roofs were covered originally with corrugated iron, with ridge-and-furrow system glass along the ridge.)  The 1916 screen is carried on a large steel lattice girder and the join between the plain steel arch of this span and the decorated iron arch of the 1854 span is of interest.  All the platforms were extended in concrete out towards Bishop's Bridge in 1930-34 and given steel island canopies. \n \nINTERIOR: The office range along Platform 1 and Eastbourne Terrace contained Royal, First and Second Class Waiting Rooms, the Rooms of the Board and Directors of GWR, as well as the Booking Office and Refreshment Rooms.  Some of these uses still survive but the spaces have all been altered and divided up.  There are several stone staircases with wrought iron balustrades.  The frontage of these buildings to Platform 1 is single-storey and has an arcaded treatment as on the street facade, designed by Matthew Digby Wyatt.  Features include a 5-bay open arcade through to the street with the centre carrying the fine three-faced station clock supported on elaborate brackets; the Stationmaster's balcony which is an elaborate triple oriel with arched openings and Moorish style ironwork; and the GWR War Memorial of polished granite and Portland stone designed by TS Tait, with a fine bronze figure of an infantryman by Charles Sarjeant Jagger.  This is inscribed on the base 'In honour of those who served in the World Wars 1914-1918, 1939-1945. 25,479 men of the Great Western Railway joined His Majesty's forces, 2,254 gave their lives.'   Beyond the east end of the trainshed is an area traditionally called 'The Lawn', originally open, which was roofed over in 1933-4 and is now filled with a two-storey glass and steel envelope of 1998-2000 designed by Nicholas Grimshaw and Partners.  Within this is the rear wall of the Great Western Royal Hotel (q.v.), which was given a new wing running across this elevation in 1936. In the concourse to the south of the platforms are a number of late C20 kiosks; generally, these are not of special interest.Roof structure: The roof is in four spans, three designed by Brunel and constructed 1852-4 (contractors Fox, Henderson and Co), with the fourth and largest added by the GWR in 1914-16.  All were restored in the years either side of 2000. The five-centred arches are carried on hexagonal steel columns, which replaced the original cast-iron ones in 1916-24.  Wrought-iron arches above have bolted-on decorative work in the Moorish style by Matthew Digby Wyatt and Owen Jones.  The arches were originally untied; the curved wrought-iron ties were added in 1916.  All were fully restored 1998-2000, including the Bristol end screens.  The roof members are pierced by stars, planets and other shapes, these being both decorative and to assist with the fixing of scaffolding etc.  The fourth (1916) span has been partly ceiled by a canvas awning of 2000 at the London end designed by Nicholas Grimshaw and Partners. Whilst of lesser historical or engineering significance than the C19 Brunel spans, the fourth span extension was carefully designed to complement the existing roof, is an impressive space in its own right, and forms an integral part of today's station. Another notable feature within this arch is the enormous steel and concrete (Hennibique) support for London Street above, when constructed the largest structure of its type.  HISTORY: Paddington station was first opened for the GWR in 1838 as a temporary terminus immediately to the west of Bishop's Bridge.  This station was largely constructed of timber and used the arches of the bridge as the entries.  The new station was built a quarter of a mile east of the old one in 1851-4 to the designs of the Company Engineer IK Brunel, with architectural assistance from MD Wyatt and for the decoration from Owen Jones.  Trains began running (on Brunel's broad gauge tracks) in 1861. The last broad gauge one left it in 1892. Paddington had its first major addition in 1863 when the Metropolitan Railway's Hammersmith and City station was added on the north side.  This station, originally called Bishop's Bridge, was enlarged in 1876 and later incorporated into mainline Paddington. Increase in traffic led to the quadrupling of the track out to Slough in 1879.  In 1880 Paddington was lit by electricity for the first time, the first major London public building to be so illuminated, and this was permanent from 1886 using the GWR's own power station at Park Royal.  A major programme of improvements of 1906-16 included rebuilding all ten of the approach over-bridges with large steel spans.  That was finished in 1914, and meanwhile the fourth roof span was added to the north side of the station 1912-6. Following this the cast-iron columns supporting Brunel's roof were replaced with the present steel ones in 1922-4; those in the north cab-road had already gone in 1916.  This work was designed by Company Engineer WW Grierson and erected by the Cleveland Bridge Company.  A second major rebuilding programme of 1930-34 followed the Development (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act of 1929, designed to alleviate unemployment.  The works included the extension of the platforms, the construction of 'The Lawn' as a passenger concourse (now redeveloped again) and the building of two new office blocks and the extension of the hotel (q.v.).  The station was badly damaged by bombing during World War II (see above) and not all this damage was made good.  With the end of steam traction in the 1960s the station was cleaned up, and the concourse was enlarged in 1968-9 and again in the 1970s.  The approach tracks were again re-laid and re-signalled in 1992-4 and at the same time the Brunel roof was progressively repaired and decorated.  Finally 'The Lawn' building was demolished in 1999 and has been replaced by a larger and more attractive version designed by Nicholas Grimshaw and Partners (which also supervised the restoration of the end screens of the Brunel shed).

    "wikipediaText": "Paddington, also known as London Paddington, is a London railway station and London Underground station complex, located on Praed Street in the Paddington area. The site has been the London terminus of services provided by the Great Western Railway and its successors since 1838. Much of the main line station dates from 1854 and was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. As of the 2022â23 Office of Rail & Road Statistics, it is the second busiest station in the United Kingdom, after London Liverpool Street, with 59.2 million entries and exits.\nPaddington is the London terminus of the Great Western Main Line; passenger services are primarily operated by Great Western Railway, which provides commuter and regional passenger services to west London and the Thames Valley region, as well as long-distance intercity services to South West England and South Wales. The station is also the eastern terminus for Heathrow Express and the western terminus for Elizabeth line services from Shenfield. Elizabeth line services also run through Paddington westwards to Reading, Heathrow Terminal 5, and Heathrow Terminal 4, and eastwards to Abbey Wood. Situated in fare zone 1, it has two separate tube stations providing connections to the Bakerloo, Circle, District, and Hammersmith & City lines. It is one of 11 London stations managed directly by Network Rail.\nThe station has been perennially popular for passengers and goods, particularly milk and parcels. Major upgrades took place in the 1870s, the 1910s and the 1960s, each trying to add additional platforms and space while trying to preserve the existing services and architecture as much as possible. Paddington was first served by London Underground trains in 1863, as the original western terminus of the Metropolitan Railway, the world's first underground railway. In the 20th century, suburban and commuter services appeared at Paddington as the urban sprawl of London moved westwards. Despite the numerous upgrades and rebuilding, plus damage sustained in particular during World War II, Brunel's original design is still recognisable.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\nThe station complex is bounded at the front by Praed Street and at the rear by Bishop's Bridge Road, which crosses the station throat on Bishop's Bridge. On the west side of the station is Eastbourne Terrace, while the east side is bounded by the Paddington arm of the Grand Union Canal. The station is in a shallow cutting, a fact obscured at the front by a hotel building, but which can be clearly seen from the other three sides. To the north of the station is the Westway, to the northeast is Edgware Road, and to the east and southeast is the London Inner Ring Road.\nThe surrounding area is partly residential, and includes the major St Mary's Hospital, restaurants and hotels. Until recently there was little office accommodation in the area, and most commuters interchanged between National Rail and the London Underground to reach workplaces in the West End or the City. However, recent redevelopment of derelict railway and canal land, marketed as Paddington Waterside, has resulted in new office complexes nearby.\nThe station is in London fare zone 1. In addition to the Underground stations at Paddington, Lancaster Gate station on the Central line is a short walk away to the south. A little further to the south lie the conjoined parks of Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens.\nThe narrow busy section of the incoming main railway line between Ladbroke Grove and Paddington station is known as Paddington Throat among some engineers.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe National Rail station is officially named London Paddington, a name commonly used outside London but rarely by Londoners, who call it just Paddington, as on the London Underground map. This same practice applies to all the London mainline rail termini, except London Bridge. Parts of the station, including the main train shed, date from 1854, when it was built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel as the London terminus for the Great Western Railway (GWR). It is one of eleven stations in London managed by Network Rail.\n\n\n=== Great Western Railway ===\nAfter several false starts, Brunel announced the construction of a railway from Bristol to London on 30 July 1833. This became the GWR, and he intended it to be the best railway in the country. The GWR had originally planned to terminate London services at Euston as this allowed them to use part of the London and Birmingham Railway's track into the station, which would have been cost effective. This received government approval in 1835, but was rejected as a long-term solution by Brunel as he was concerned it would also allow Liverpool to compete as a port with Bristol if the railway from Birmingham was extended.\nThe first station was a temporary terminus for the GWR on the west side of Bishop's Bridge Road, opened on 4 June 1838. The first GWR service from London to Taplow, near Maidenhead, ran from Paddington in 1838. After the main station opened, this became the site of the goods depot. Brunel did not consider that anything less than a grand terminus dedicated to the GWR would be acceptable, and consequently this was approved in February 1853.\n\nThe main station between Bishop's Bridge Road and Praed Street was designed by Brunel, who was enthusiastic at the idea of being able to design a railway station himself, although much of the architectural detailing was by his associate Matthew Digby Wyatt.  He took inspiration from Joseph Paxton's Crystal Palace and the MÃ¼nchen Hauptbahnhof. The glazed roof is supported by wrought iron arches in three spans, respectively spanning 68 feet (21 m), 102 feet (31 m) and 70 feet (21 m). The roof is 699 feet (210 m) long, and the original roof spans had two transepts connecting the three spans.\nIt is commonly believed that these were provided by Brunel to accommodate traversers to carry coaches between the tracks within the station. However recent research, using early documents and photographs, does not seem to support this belief, and their actual purpose is unknown. The original station used four platforms, 27-foot (8.2 m)-wide and 24-foot-6-inch (7.47 m)-wide departure platforms, a 21-foot (6.4 m) arrival platform, and a 47-foot (14 m) combined arrival platform and cab road. A series of nineteen turnplates were sited beyond the ends of the platforms for horse and coach traffic.\nThe first GWR service from the new station departed on 16 January 1854, though the roof had not been finished at this point and there were no arrivals. It was formally opened on 29 May, and the older temporary station was demolished the following year.\n\nThe Great Western Hotel was built on Praed Street in front of the station from 1851 to 1854 by architect Philip Charles Hardwick, son of Philip Hardwick (designer of the Euston Arch) in a classical and French-chateau design. It opened on 9 June 1854, and had 103 bedrooms and 15 sitting rooms. Each corner contained a tower containing two additional floors beyond the five storeys of the main block. It was originally run by a consortium of GWR shareholders and staff, before the company took over operations completely in 1896.\nThe station was substantially enlarged in 1906â1915 and a fourth span of 109 feet (33 m) was added on the north side, parallel to the others. The new span was built in a similar style to the original three spans, but the detailing is different and it has no transepts. The area between the rear of the hotel and the concourse is called the Lawn. It was originally unroofed and occupied by sidings, but was later built up to form part of the station's first concourse.\nPaddington's capacity was doubled to four tracks in the 1870s. The quadrupling was completed to Westbourne Park on 30 October 1871, Slough in June 1879 and Maidenhead in September 1884. An additional platform (later to become No. 9) opened in June 1878, while two new departure platforms (later Nos. 4 and 5) were added in 1885. One of the lines between what is now platform 5 and 7 was removed, in order that the latter could be moved to a more southerly position. Aside from the June 1878 work, Brunel's original roof structure remained untouched throughout the improvements.\nThe GWR began experimenting with the electric lighting in 1880, leading to Paddington being decorated with Christmas lights that year. Although the system was unreliable, it spurred the GWR on to a more ambitious lighting scheme in 1886, in which a 145V AC supply could light the terminus, office, goods yard and Royal Oak and Westbourne Park stations. It was praised for its scale and showing that electricity could compete with gas lighting on the same scale.\nPaddington became an important milk depot towards the end of the 19th century. A milk dock was built 1881, and by the 20th century over 3,000 churns were being handled at the station every day. Other goods such as meat, fish, horses and flowers were also transported through Paddington. Passenger traffic continued to improve as well. In March 1906, the goods depot at Westbourne Park was moved to Old Oak Common. The main departure platform was extended in 1908 and used for milk and parcels.\nIn 1911, work began to separate light and empty carriage traffic from running trains between Paddington to Old Oak Common, which involved the rebuilding of Westbourne Park station. The work was halted because of World War I but resumed in 1926, to be completed the following year. Three new platforms were added; platform 12 in November 1913, platform 11 in December 1915, and platform 10 the following year. The roof was completely reconstructed between 1922 and 1924, replacing Brunel's original cast-iron columns with steel replicas.\n\nUnlike several other London termini, Paddington saw no damage during World War I. Although Victoria and Charing Cross were the main stations for military movement during the war, Paddington was used for some of this traffic.\nOn Armistice Day 1922, a memorial to the employees of the GWR who died during the war was unveiled by Viscount Churchill. The bronze memorial, depicting a soldier reading a letter, was sculpted by Charles Sargeant Jagger and stands on platform 1.\n\n\n=== Big Four and British Rail ===\nThe GWR was the only railway company that continued through the Big Four grouping in 1923. A tube railway for the Post Office, opened in December 1927, could cater for around 10,000 mailbags every day.\nPaddington was extended again from 1930 to 1934. Platforms 2 to 11 were extended past the Bishop's Road bridge and a new parcel depot was built. Suburban services, which had never been considered important at Paddington, were increased as new housing estates in the Home Counties started being built. Bishop's Road station was rebuilt, giving an extra four platforms to Paddington (Nos. 13â16) and providing a new ticket office and entrance for suburban services next to the bridge. A public address system was introduced in 1936. By this time, around 22,000 parcels a day were being forwarded from Paddington, with the Royal Mail service processing around 4,500 mailbags and 2,400 parcel bags every day.\nThe station came under attack several times during World War II. On 17 April 1941, the departure side of the station was hit by a parachute mine, while on 22 March 1944, the roof between platforms 6 and 7 was destroyed by two 500-pound (230 kg) bombs. Passenger traffic greatly increased through Paddington during the war, partly by evacuation to the relatively quiet Thames Valley, and because holidaymakers chose to travel west as large areas of the south and east coasts had been taken over for military purposes. On 29 July 1944, the station was closed for three hours because the platforms were saturated with passenger traffic, while on the subsequent August bank holiday, crowds were controlled in tight queues along Eastbourne Terrace by mounted police.\n\nSteam traffic began to be replaced in the late 1950s. Between 1959 and 1961, suburban services switched to diesel multiple units, while the last regular long-distance steam train left Paddington on 11 June 1965. The track layout was reorganised in 1967, abolishing the distinction between arrival and departure platforms that had been a feature of Paddington since opening. A new set of sidings was built south of Royal Oak, and the track curve into Paddington was eased. Services to the Midlands were rerouted via Marylebone during this time.\nThe station concourse was enlarged in 1970, and the ticket office was rebuilt in the same year. By this time, public opinion had turned against wholesale demolition and redevelopment of stations such as Euston, and consequently the rebuilding work was done with an eye towards preserving Brunel and Wyatt's original station design. Special steam services began to be run from Paddington again in the 1980s.\nIn 1982, a bronze statue of Brunel was erected on the station concourse. It was sculpted by John Doubleday and funded by the Bristol and West Building Society. Between 1989 and 1999, the Lawn was re-roofed and separated from the concourse by a glass screen wall. It is surrounded by shops and cafes on several levels.\n\n\n=== Privatisation ===\nAs with other major British railway termini, Paddington is owned and managed by Network Rail. Train services were privatised in 1996, initially to Great Western Trains and Thames Trains. The former company was renamed First Great Western in 1998, and merged with First Great Western Link and Wessex Trains to form the Greater Western franchise in 2006. In 2015, the operating company was renamed Great Western Railway.\nIn the mid 1990s, the Great Western Main Line approaches and platforms were electrified as part of the Heathrow Express project. Opening in 1998, the airport rail link connects the station directly to Heathrow Airport. From 1999 until 2003, Express Baggage check-in facilities for airline passengers were provided in the Lawn, however these were progressively replaced by retail units.\nThe station's fourth span was renovated in 2010, involving repair and restoration of the original glazed roof, so that platforms 9 to 12 can once more enjoy daylight. A false ceiling or crash deck had been in place since 1996. Work was completed and the restored roof unveiled in July 2011. A second phase of improvements began in July 2014 and was completed two years later. Network Rail originally planned to demolish Span 4 and build an office block over it, which was successfully contested by Save Britain's Heritage.\nIn the mid 2010s, construction began on an underground station as part of the Crossrail project, located south west of the main station building. Coinciding with this project, a new taxi rank and pick up point was built north of the main station, as well as comprehensive upgrades to Paddington tube station. The underground platforms opened as the Elizabeth line on 24 May 2022.\nThe station had historically been criticised for very poor air quality inside the train shed; however, the replacement of diesel InterCity 125 trains by bi-mode Class 800 and 802 trains in the late 2010s improved air quality.\nLondon Paddington has always been one of the busiest stations in the UK, and was ranked as the 8th busiest station in the United Kingdom during the 2016â17 period according to the Office of Rail & Road, with 36.6 million passengers during that period, and was placed between Stratford and London St Pancras International. However, as a result of the opening of the Elizabeth Line, alongside London Liverpool Street, it has become far busier, and London Paddington had become the 2nd busiest station in the United Kingdom during the 2022â23 period, with 59.2 million total passengers, behind London Liverpool Street and ahead of London Waterloo, the former busiest station.\n\n\n== Services ==\n\nPaddington is the London terminus for long-distance high-speed trains operated by Great Western Railway. Two services go to Heathrow Airport: the Heathrow Express travels non-stop at a premium fare, while Elizabeth line takes the same route but calls at all intermediate stations.\nThe station has 13 terminal platforms, numbered 1 to 12 and 14 from south-west to north-east (left to right as seen from the concourse). Platforms 1 to 8 are below the original three spans of Brunel's train shed, platforms 9 to 12 beneath the later fourth span. Platform 13 was decommissioned in December 2016 to permit lengthening of platform 12 for 10-coach trains.\nPlatform 14 is within the Metropolitan Railway's old Bishop's Road (Suburban) station to the north-west. Immediately alongside are through platforms 15 and 16, used by the London Underground's Hammersmith & City and Circle lines. The current operator, Great Western Railway, assigns numbers to the pocket timetables it publishes, and its services to Bath, Bristol, Weston-super-Mare and South Wales are in timetable number 1.\nWith the building of the Elizabeth line Paddington gained two more low level platforms numbered A and B. These are located underground in the Elizabeth line section of the station directly to the south west of the main concourse. \nThe concourse stretches across the heads of platforms 1 to 12, underneath the London end of the four train sheds. Platform 14 can only be reached indirectly via the north-western end of platform 12. A footbridge crosses the north-western end of the station and gives access to platforms 1â12 and 14. There are ticket barriers to platforms 2â7 and 10â14. \nA first-class lounge on Platform 1 provides complimentary refreshments and Wi-Fi internet access. It also has screens showing television news as well as a departure board.\nPlatform 7 is dedicated to the Heathrow Express. Flight information display screens for airline passengers are provided at the Heathrow Express ticket office near these platforms.  An integrated timetable is offered between Paddington and Rosslare Europort in Ireland via the Stena Line ferry from Fishguard Harbour railway station with through ticketing to stations and a daily morning and evening service in both directions, changing at Newport, Cardiff or Swansea. This route has been in existence since 1906.\nPaddington is the terminus for suburban trains to West London, Thames Valley, Reading, and Didcot, operated by Great Western Railway.\nThe general off peak service pattern in trains per hour (tph) is:\nGreat Western Railway\n\n1 tph Newbury\n2 tph Bristol Temple Meads with 1 tp2h continuing to Weston-super-Mare\n2 tph Cardiff Central with 1 tph carrying on to Swansea\n1 tph Cheltenham Spa\n1 tp2h to Exeter St Davids (some services extended to various destinations in the South West)\n1 tp2h to Newbury (alternates with the Exeter St Davids Intercity service)\n2 tph Oxford with 1 tph carrying on to Great Malvern (some services extended to Hereford)\n1 tph Plymouth via Exeter St Davids (1tp2h extended to Penzance)\n2 tph Didcot Parkway (stopping service using the relief lines)\nElizabeth line (operates from underground Elizabeth line platforms, A and B)\n\n4 tph Heathrow Terminal 4\n2 tph Heathrow Terminal 5\n2 tph Reading\n2 tph Maidenhead\n8 tph Abbey Wood\n8 tph Shenfield\nHeathrow Express\n\n4 tph Heathrow Terminal 5\n\nUntil May 2003, Paddington was part of the Virgin CrossCountry network with services to the North of England and Scotland via Oxford and Birmingham New Street. From June 2005 until May 2018, Paddington was the terminus for Heathrow Connect services.\nUntil December 2018, Chiltern Railways operated a weekday parliamentary service from South Ruislip and to High Wycombe via the ActonâNortholt line. It ceased when the Acton-Northolt line closed. When its London Marylebone terminus was closed, Chiltern Railways diverted its services to London Paddington as did Wrexham & Shropshire between 2008 and 2011.\n\n\n== Accidents and incidents ==\nOn 9 August 1920, a passenger train collided with the buffers. Two people were injured. The following year, a passenger train was being shunted into a platform and collided with three luggage vans already occupying the line. A carriage was derailed and a luggage van was wrecked.\nOn 23 November 1983, a sleeper train hauled by Class 50 locomotive 50 041 Bulwark was derailed on the approach to Paddington after speeding through a crossover. Three of the seventy passengers were injured.\nOn 18 February 1991, Paddington was bombed by the Provisional IRA, causing bad damage to the station's roof. Three hours later London Victoria station was targeted in a much more serious attack.\nThe worst accident at Paddington was the Ladbroke Grove rail crash (also called the Paddington rail crash). On 5 October 1999, a Thames Train stopping service from Paddington to Bedwyn passed a red signal and collided with a Great Western express travelling in the opposite direction. The drivers of both trains were killed, along with 29 passengers; 400 others were injured.\nOn 25 May 2014, the middle coach of an empty stock Class 360 electric multiple unit 360 205 derailed as it entered platform 3, due to maintenance errors.\nOn 16 June 2016, a Class 165 diesel multiple unit 165 124 passed a signal at danger and derailed in a siding, causing significant disruption to services and damage to infrastructure.\nOn 20 August 2017, a Class 43, 43188 derailed during departure from Platform 2, when forming the rear power car of the 11:57 service to Penzance.\n\n\n== London Underground stations ==\n\nThe GWR was aware that Paddington was some distance from the centre of London, and in 1854 donated Â£175,000 (Â£20,748,000 as of 2023) to the North Metropolitan Railway in order that the station could have a link to the City. Consequently, Paddington was the original western terminus of the line when it opened on 1 January 1863. An extension to the Metropolitan Railway provided Paddington with a connection to south of the River Thames, opening from Praed Street Junction via a new station at Paddington, located on Praed Street, to Gloucester Road on 1 October 1868. An extension of the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway to Paddington opened on 1 December 1913, connecting to the Metropolitan Railway's Praed Street station.\nBecause of the history of the various railways, Paddington is served by four London Underground lines through two separate stations: the Bakerloo, Circle and District lines have a combined sub-surface and deep-level station on Praed Street to the south of the main line station, and the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines have a sub-surface station with access from Paddington Basin to the north. Circle line services run through both of the sub-surface stations as part of a spiral route. Although shown on the London Underground map as a single station, the two stations are not directly linked.\nLancaster Gate Underground station on the Central line and Marylebone mainline station are within walking distance, and out-of-station interchanges to these stations are permitted at no extra cost if made within the permitted time.\n\n\n== Elizabeth line station ==\n\nAs part of the Crossrail project, a new underground station was constructed on the site of the former taxi rank in Departures Road. The platforms opened with the launch of the Elizabeth line on 24 May 2022.\nBuilt using cut and cover construction, the station box is 23 m (75 ft) deep and 260 m (850 ft) long. As part of the construction of the station, the taxi rank was moved to the north side of the station, and Eastbourne Terrace was closed in early 2012 for two years to allow construction of the station box to take place.\nThe station was designed by Weston Williamson, with a 90 m (300 ft) clear opening into the underground station covered by a 120 m (390 ft) long by 23 m (75 ft) wide glass canopy. Artwork of cloud formations by the artist Spencer Finch has been digitally printed onto the glass canopy. The station was awarded a Civic Trust Award in 2023.\nIn the 1990s proposals for Crossrail, the station was to be built in the same location on Eastbourne Terrace but would have been designed by the architect Will Alsop with a similar canopy-based design.\nLike all Elizabeth line stations, the station has been built to be fully accessible, with lifts and step-free access. An underground connecting passage between the Bakerloo line platforms and the Elizabeth line platforms has been built.\n\n\n== Cultural references ==\n\nThe children's book character Paddington Bear was named after the station. In the books, by Michael Bond, he is found at the station, having come from \"deepest, darkest Peru\" and with a note attached to his coat reading \"please look after this bear, thank you\". A statue of him by Marcus Cornish, based on the original drawings by Peggy Fortnum, is located under the clock on platform 1.\nPaddington station has been referred to in several popular works of fiction. It is mentioned in several Sherlock Holmes novels. In The Hound of the Baskervilles, Watson and his companions Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry Baskerville leave for Dartmoor from Paddington, while in The Boscombe Valley Mystery, Holmes and Watson leave the station for a train to Boscombe Valley near Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire. The mystery novel 4.50 From Paddington (1957) by Agatha Christie begins with a murder witnessed by a passenger on a train from Paddington.\nOne of The Railway Series books, The Eight Famous Engines, contains a story about Gordon, Duck and a foreign engine debating which station London is. Duck says that he used to work at Paddington so he knows that Paddington is most important. However, Gordon later finds out that the station in London is St Pancras. There is a fictional underground Paddington station on the North London System in the novel The Horn of Mortal Danger (1980).\nPaddington station was the subject of William Powell Frith's 1862 painting The Railway Station. The portrait was viewed by over 21,000 people (paying a shilling each) in the first seven weeks of its being publicly shown. The painting is now held in the Royal Holloway College.\nThe band Supertramp used Paddington station to record the train sounds featured in the song \"Rudy\" on the 1974 album Crime of the Century. There is a documentary television series about Paddington station on Channel 5 called Paddington Station 24/7.\n\n\n== Connections ==\nLondon Buses routes 7, 16, 23, 27, 36, 46, 205 and night routes N7, N27 and N205 serve the station.\n\n\n== Railway band ==\nPaddington is home to the Great Western Railway Paddington Band, the last railway band in England. It plays on Friday evenings on the main concourse. In 1997, Railtrack unsuccessfully tried to evict the band, citing a lack of space while the station was redeveloped to accommodate Heathrow Express services.\n\n\n== References ==\nCitations\n\nSources\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nVaughan, John (1982).

    "wikipediaText": "Benjamin Franklin House is a museum in a terraced Georgian house at 36 Craven Street, London, close to Trafalgar Square. It is the last-standing former residence of Benjamin Franklin, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. The house dates from c. 1730, and Franklin lived and worked there from 1757 to 1774. The museum opened to the public on 17 January 2006. The chairman is American-British investment banker and philanthropist John Studzinski.\nThe house is listed Grade I on the National Heritage List for England for its historic association with Franklin.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nThe house was renovated and restored in 1998 by The Friends of Benjamin Franklin House in order for the house to be turned into a museum. During the excavation the remains of 10 individuals were identified, consisting of numerous bones and bone fragments; six of them identified as possible children.\nTests conducted on the remains showed that they were around 200 years old, which means that they may have been buried in the basement at the same time that Franklin was living there. However, further evidence showed that a close friend of Franklin, William Hewson, was the one responsible for the human remains. Hewson, an early anatomist, had lived in the house for two years and had been working in secret, since there were still legal issues in dissecting certain cadavers at the time. Franklin likely knew what Hewson was doing, but probably did not participate in the dissections.\nThe museum at 36 Craven Street is a Grade I listed property and retains a number of its original features (include original floorboards, original ceilings, and original staircases) with relatively few later alterations. Current conservation policies emphasise the need for minimal modern interventions.\nArtefacts at the house include a modern, playable replica glass harmonica, based on Franklin's design.\n\n\n== Modern facilities ==\nThe \"Historical Experience\" includes an actor portraying historical characters associated with the house along with dialog, sound, lighting, and special effects. The character used in the \"Historical Experience\" is Polly Stevenson Hewson, the daughter of Franklin's landlady who became a \"second daughter\" to Franklin.\nThe \"Student Science Centre\" allows students to re-create experiments from Franklin's sojourn in London. It includes a Medical History Room (focused on the medical research of William Hewson, who did his work from the house for a time), a Discovery Room (containing historical artifacts), and a Demonstration Room (in which students can replicate Franklin's experiments).\nThe Benjamin Franklin House is open free-of-charge to school visits on Tuesdays. Although designed for key stage 2 students, visits can be tailored for students of all key stages.\nThe \"Scholarship Centre\" on the top floor of the House is a centre for study of the many subjects Franklin pursued.\nBenjamin Franklin House runs an annual Literary Prize in which people interpret a Benjamin Franklin quote in its significance today.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBenjamin Franklin National Memorial â in Philadelphia in the United States\nFranklin Court, the site of one of Franklin's residences in Philadelphia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nThe Friends of the Benjamin Franklin House, U.S. Records, documenting many aspects of the project to restore 36 Craven Street, are available for research use at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania.\nBenjamin Franklin House on Museums London directory.\n Media related to Benjamin Franklin House at Wikimedia Commons"

    "wikipediaText": "Cumberland Terrace is a neoclassical terrace on the eastern side of Regent's Park in the London Borough of Camden, completed in 1826. It is a Grade I listed building.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was one of several terraces and crescents around Regent's Park designed by the British architect John Nash (1752â1835), under the patronage of the Prince Regent (later George IV). The terrace was to stand opposite the Prince's proposed palace in the park and was therefore of particular importance in the scheme. It was named after the Prince Regent's brother, the Duke of Cumberland (King George III's younger son), later King of Hanover.\nThe Terrace was built by William Mountford Nurse, with James Thomson serving as resident architect, and was completed in 1826. It consists of three main blocks, linked by decorative arches with typical  neoclassical style and grandeur. The central block includes a large sculptural pediment by J. G. Bubb above a long colonnade of Ionic columns. Originally comprising 31 houses which were entirely reconstructed behind the original faÃ§ade in the 1960s, some have been converted into flats but many houses are still separate family homes.\nDuring the Second World War the Nash buildings around the park, including Cumberland Terrace, fell into what one newspaper called \"a sad state of neglect â¦ caused by bombing and the ravages of time\". An official report commented \"there is not a single terrace which does not give the impression of hopeless dereliction\". In the early 1950s restoration work restored the portico of Cumberland Terrace to \"its former glory\". The terrace was mainly occupied by government departments during and after the war, and in the 1950s there was a short-lived proposal to turn the whole terrace into a hall of residence for the University of London. By 1957 the freeholder of the terrace, the Crown Estate, had adopted the policy of returning it, and the other Nash terraces, to private residential use, as recommended ten years earlier in the report of a government committee on the post-war future of the terraces.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nThe first resident, William Mountford Nurse himself, moved into the terrace in 1828; the building was not fully occupied until 1836. \nAnother early resident was the art collector Henry Vaughan, who lived at no. 28 from 1834 until his death in 1899. He gave The Hay Wain to the National Gallery after enjoying it at home for some twenty years.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s the pianist Mark Hambourg lived at 27 Cumberland Terrace with his wife, the violinist Dorothea Muir Mackenzie and their four daughters, including the pianist Michal Hambourg. Other residents of the terrace included the actresses Gladys Cooper and Fay Compton. Wallis Simpson moved into No 16 in 1936 after leaving her husband. Among those born in Cumberland Terrace were the theatre manager Sir Bronson Albery, the teacher and historian Oscar Browning, the author Daphne du Maurier (at the house, no. 24, of her father, the actor Gerald du Maurier) and the playwright Gertrude Jennings. \n\n\n== See also ==\nList of eponymous roads in London\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNotes, photographs and maps\nLost and hidden villas\nDoctor Who Locations â Cumberland Terrace\nHistory, Historical Illustrations"

Constructed between 1852 and 1855 for The Crystal Palace Company on a twenty acre site. \nThe prehistoric animals were constructed out of re-constituted stone on a framework of iron rods on brick plinths by Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins, an artist and sculptor who specialised in natural history subjects, with advice on their authenticity by Sir Richard Owen. The associated geological strata and lead mine were probably laid out by David Thomas Ansted, consulting geologist, but constructed by James Campbell using geological rocks. The landscape was designed to represent the geology of Britain from the Primary (Pre-Cambrian and Lower Palaeolithic) rocks through the Secondary (Upper Palaeolithic-Upper Cretaceous) and Tertiary (Tertiary and Quaternary) eras with economic rocks, geological structures and reconstructions of associated animals and reptiles on the lakeside and islands. \nTo the south west of the site facing the lower lake is a cliff constructed to illustrate the coal formation with old red sandstone at the base, new red sandstone above and mountain limestone and millstone grit above this. To the south west of this is a three quarters scale representation of a Derbyshire lead mine with cave complete with stalactites. To the east is the Secondary island illustrating the Secondary era with geological features including tilted red sandstone and in turn Lias Oolite and Wealden rocks, surmounted by chalk at the head of the island. On top of the rocks are reconstructions of animals recovered from these geological formations, two Dicynodonts and three Labrinthodonts from New Red Sandstone, three Icthyosaurs and three Plesiosaurs from the Lias, two Teleosaurus, two Pterodactyls re-constructed in fibreglass of the Oolite and Chalk, one Megalosaurus from Stonefield Slate and its prey from the Weald, two Iguanodons and one Hyaelosaurus and the chalk marine monster Mosasaurus. Originally the lake water rose and fell as the park fountains played, alternately submerging and revealing the aquatic animals. Separated from the Secondary island by a weir is the Tertiary island with animals placed on a geological backdrop of worked aggregates representing this era's relatively unconsolidated rocks. These comprise two Palaeotheriums and three Anoplotheriums from the Paris basin, one Megatherium from South America and four Megaceros or \"Irish Elk\". Further planned reconstructions for the Secondary era and none of the Primary era were ever constructed because the project ran into financial difficulties and was terminated in 1855.STATEMENT OF IMPORTANCE: This was the first attempt to accurately re-construct the three dinosaur species known to the scientific world by the 1850s within their geological environment and the sculptures and associated geological strata form a unique display of the state of palaeological understanding in the 1850s, opened five years before the publication of Darwin's \"Origin of Species\".

    "wikipediaText": "The Crystal Palace Dinosaurs are a series of sculptures of dinosaurs and other extinct animals, inaccurate by modern standards, in the London borough of Bromley's Crystal Palace Park. Commissioned in 1852 to accompany the Crystal Palace after its move from the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park, they were unveiled in 1854 as the first dinosaur sculptures in the world. The models were designed and sculpted by Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins under the scientific direction of Sir Richard Owen, representing the latest scientific knowledge at the time. The models, also known as the Geological Court or Dinosaur Court, were classed as Grade II listed buildings from 1973, extensively restored in 2002, and upgraded to Grade I listed in 2007.\nThe models represent 15 genera of extinct animals, only three of which are true dinosaurs. They are from a wide range of geological ages, and include true dinosaurs, ichthyosaurs, and plesiosaurs mainly from the Mesozoic era, and some mammals from the more recent Cenozoic era. Today, the models are notable for representing the scientific inaccuracies of early palaeontology, the result of improperly reconstructed fossils and the nascent nature of the science in the 19th century, with the Iguanodon and Megalosaurus models being particularly singled out.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nFollowing the closure of the Great Exhibition in October 1851, Joseph Paxton's Crystal Palace was bought and moved to Penge Place atop Sydenham Hill, South London, by the newly formed Crystal Palace Company. The grounds that surrounded it were then extensively renovated and turned into a public park with ornamental gardens, replicas of statues and two new man-made lakes. As part of this renovation, Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins was commissioned to build the first-ever life-sized models of extinct animals. He had originally planned to just re-create extinct mammals before deciding on building dinosaurs as well, which he did with advice from Sir Richard Owen, a celebrated anatomist and palaeontologist of the time.  \nHawkins set up a workshop on site at the park and built the models there. The dinosaurs were built full-size in clay, from which a mould was taken allowing cement sections to be cast. The larger sculptures are hollow with a brickwork interior. There was also a limestone cliff to illustrate different geological strata. The sculptures and the geological displays were originally called \"the Geological Court\", an extension of the set of exhibits made for the park that reconstructed historic art, including the Renaissance, Assyrian, and Egyptian Courts.\nThe models were displayed on three islands acting as a rough timeline, the first island for the Palaeozoic era, a second for the Mesozoic, and a third for the Cenozoic. The models were given more realism by making the water level in the lake rise and fall, revealing different amounts of the dinosaurs. To mark the launch of the models, Hawkins held a dinner on New Year's Eve 1853 inside the mould of one of the Iguanodon models.\n\nHawkins benefited greatly from the public's reaction to the dinosaurs, which was so strong it allowed for the sale of sets of small versions of the dinosaur models, priced at Â£30 for educational use. But the building of the models was costly (having cost around Â£13,729) and in 1855, the Crystal Palace Company cut Hawkins's funding. Several planned models were never made, while those half finished were scrapped, despite protest from sources including the Sunday newspaper, The Observer.\nHawkins later worked on a \"Palaeozoic Museum\" in New York's Central Park, an American equivalent to the Crystal Palace Dinosaurs. In May 1871 many of the exhibits in Hawkins' workshop were destroyed by vandals and their fragments buried, possibly including elements of the original Elasmosaurus skeleton, which the American palaeontologist Edward Drinker Cope had loaned to Hawkins for preparation at the time.\n\nWith progress in palaeontology, the reputation of the Crystal Palace models declined. In 1895, the American fossil hunter Othniel Charles Marsh scorned the dinosaurs' friends as doing them a great injustice, and spoke angrily of the models. The models and the park fell into disrepair as the years went by, a process aided by the fire that destroyed the Crystal Palace itself in 1936, and the models became obscured by overgrown foliage. A full restoration of the animals was carried out in 1952 by Victor H.C. Martin, at which time the mammals on the third island were moved to less well-protected locations in the park, where they were exposed to wear and tear. The limestone cliff was blown up in the 1960s.\nIn 2001, the display was totally renovated. The destroyed limestone cliff was completely replaced using 130 large blocks of Derbyshire limestone, many weighing over 1 tonne (0.98 long tons; 1.1 short tons), rebuilt according to a small model made from the same number of polystyrene blocks. Fibreglass replacements were created for the missing sculptures, and badly damaged parts of the surviving models were recast. For example, some of the animals' legs had been modelled in lead, fixed to the bodies with iron rods; the iron had rusted, splitting the lead open.\nThe models and other elements of Crystal Palace Park were classed as Grade II listed buildings from 1973. The models were extensively restored in 2001, and upgraded to Grade I listed in 2007.\nIn 2018, the Friends of Crystal Palace Dinosaurs ran a crowd funding campaign, endorsed by the guitarist Slash, to build a permanent bridge to Dinosaur Island. The bridge was designed by Tonkin Liu with engineering by Arup. The bridge swings on a pivot so it can be parked when not in use, to prevent unauthorised access. It was installed in January 2021.\nIn May 2021, the nose and mouth of the Megalosaurus sculpture was given an emergency renovation, after it had fallen off the previous year. Twenty-two new teeth and a 'prosthetic jaw' were installed on the sculpture. The renovation was funded by a grant from the Cultural Recovery Fund and fundraising from Friends of Crystal Palace Dinosaurs.\n\n\n== The Dinosaur Park ==\n\nFifteen genera  of extinct animals, not all dinosaurs, are represented in the park. At least three other genera (Dinornis, a mastodon, and Glyptodon) were planned, and Hawkins began to build at least the mastodon before the Crystal Palace Company cut his funding in 1855. An inaccurate map of the time shows planned locations of the Dinornis and mastodon.\n\n\n=== Palaeozoic era ===\nThe Palaeozoic era is represented in the park by the model rock exposure showing a succession of beds, namely the Carboniferous (including Coal Measures and limestone) and Permian.\nCrystal Palace's two Dicynodon models are based on incomplete Permian fossils found in South Africa, along with Owen's guess that they were similar to turtles. No evidence has been found to suggest Dicynodon had protective shells.\n\n\n=== Mesozoic era ===\n\nThe Mesozoic era is represented in the park by the model rock exposure showing a succession of beds, namely the Jurassic and Cretaceous, by models of dinosaurs and other animals known from mesozoic fossils, and by suitable vegetation â both living plants and models.\nCuriously, it is Hylaeosaurus, from the Cretaceous of England, not Iguanodon, that most resembles the giant iguana stereotype of early ideas of dinosaurs. The Hylaeosaurus in reality is much like Ankylosaurus â smallish quadrupedal herbivore with a knobbled armoured back, and spines along its sides. Hawkins's depiction is of a large Iguana-like beast with long sharp spines along its back, which Owen noted were \"accurately given in the restoration [by Hawkins, to Owen's instructions, but] necessarily at present conjectural\".\n\nThe Ichthyosaurus models are based on Triassic or Jurassic fossils from Europe. Though the three ichthyosaurs are partly in water, they are implausibly shown basking on land like seals. Owen supposed they resembled crocodiles or plesiosaurs. Better fossil evidence shows that they have more in common with sharks and dolphins, having a dorsal fin and fish-like tail, whereas in Hawkins's models the tail is a flat protuberance from a straight backbone. A further discrepancy is that the models' eyes have exposed bony sclerotic plates, Owen conjecturing that with such large eyes they had \"great powers of vision, especially in the dusk\". They became one of the three mascots of Crystal Palace Park, along with the Iguanodon and Megalosaurus (although ichthyosaurs are not dinosaurs). Coincidentally, the models more closely resemble more basic ichthyosaurs such as Cymbospondylus.\n\nThe Iguanodon models represent fossils from the Jurassic and Cretaceous of Europe. Gideon Mantell sketched the original fossil, found in Sussex in 1822 by his wife, Mary Ann Mantell, as like a long slender lizard climbing a branch (on four legs), balancing with a whiplike tail; lacking a skull, he conjectured that the thumb bone was a nose horn. The nose horn in particular is used repeatedly in popular textbooks and documentaries about dinosaurs to make fun of Victorian inaccuracies; actually, even in 1854, Owen commented \"the horn [is] more than doubtful\".\nThree Labyrinthodon models were made for Crystal Palace, based on Owen's guess that, being amphibian in lifestyle, the Triassic animals might have resembled frogs; he named them Batrachia, from the Greek 'Batrachios', frog. One is smooth skinned and is based on the species \"Labyrinthodon salamandroides\" (Mastodonsaurus jaegeri); the other two were based on \"Labyrinthodon pachygnathus\" (Cyclotosaurus pachygnathus). Casts of Chirotherium footprints that Owen thought were made by the animals were included in the ground around the models.\n\nGigantic and visually impressive, the Megalosaurus became one of the park's three 'mascot dinosaurs' along with the Iguanodon and (less so) the Ichthyosaurs. Working from fragmentary evidence from Jurassic fossils found in England, consisting mainly of a hip and femur (thigh bone), with a rib and a few vertebrae, Owen conjectured the animal was quadrupedal; palaeontologists now believe it to have been bipedal (standing like Tyrannosaurus rex). The first suggestion that some dinosaurs might have been bipedal came in 1858, just too late to influence the model.\n\nWhen the models were built, only skulls of the Cretaceous fossil Mosasaurus had been discovered in the Netherlands, so Hawkins only built the head and back of the animal. He submerged the model deep in the lake, leaving the body unseen and undefined. The Mosasaurus at Crystal Palace is positioned in an odd place near the secondary island that was originally a waterfall, and much of it is not visible from the lakeside path.\nThe three Plesiosaurus models represents three species of marine reptile, P. macrocephalus, P. dolichoderius and P. hawkinsii, from the Jurassic of England. Two of them have implausibly-flexible necks.\nOwen noted that the Pterodactylus fossils from the Jurassic of Germany had scales, not feathers, and while \"somewhat bird-like\" they had conical teeth, suggesting they were predatory. The two surviving models are perched on a rock outcrop; there were originally two more 'pterodactyls of the Oolite'. The surviving models represent Pterodactylus cuvieri (= Cimoliopterus cuvieri), whereas the two other lost pterodactyl models represent Pterodactylus bucklandi (= Dolicorhamphus bucklandi). The latter species was poorly known based on fossil remains and explains why their designs were more based on Pterodactylus antiquus.\nOwen correctly identified Teleosaurus as similar to gharials, being slender Jurassic Crocodilians with very long thin jaws and small eyes, inferring from the sediment in which they were found that they were \"more strictly marine than the crocodile of the Ganges [the gharial].\"\n\n\n=== Cenozoic era ===\n\nAnoplotherium commune is an extinct mammal species from the late Eocene to earliest Oligocene epochs, first found near Paris. Hawkins's models draw on Owen's speculation about its camel-like appearance. Three models were made, forming a small herd. Hawkins seemingly closely followed George Cuvier's reconstructions of A. commune, giving it short or naked hair following Cuvier's view that its anatomy implied an aquatic lifestyle. Hawkins deviated from Cuvier by making it look more camel-like with small lips, small and rounded ears, a sloping skull, and four toes on each foot. These errors are the result of Hawkins' overreliance on camelids as an analogue for anoplotheriids. Anoplotherium is today thought to have used its robust build and long tail for bipedal browsing.\nConfusion between whether the A. commune sculptures were of A. gracile (= Xiphodon gracilis) is common, resulting from 19th-century guidebooks listing both species as present on the Tertiary Island. A. gracile was another fossil species studied by Cuvier; it was later determined to be of a distinct genus Xiphodon. Today, the sculptures of the three animals are confirmed to be of A. commune, but the \"Megaloceros\" fawn has been identified as a misplaced statue of A. gracile. An 1854 illustration reveals that there were once four A. gracile sculptures, three of which were lost and one of which remains. The body of the sculpture appears more heavily inspired by camelids than A. commune with a gracile muscle build.\n\nMegaloceros giganteus or Irish Elk is a species from the Pliocene to Pleistocene epochs in Eurasia. Hawkins built four Megaloceros sculptures, two male and two female. One sculpture of a doe was lost, leaving just three sculptures today. The adult male's antlers were made from actual fossil antlers, long since replaced. Moved from the third island, they had fallen into disrepair as they were easily reached by vandals. With their original but fragile antlers, the Irish Elks were the most accurate of the Cenozoic models; since they are of recent geological age (dying out 11,000 years ago), Hawkins was able to model them on living deer.\nThe giant ground sloth Megatherium is from the Pliocene to Pleistocene epochs in South America, where Charles Darwin had excavated some fossils in 1835. The model was built hugging a live tree which subsequently grew and broke the model's arm. The arm was replaced and later the tree died. The model depicts the sloth as having a short trunk like a tapir, something the real animal never had. This model used to be in the children's zoo which has now been demolished.\n\nThe models of Palaeotherium represent an extinct Eocene mammal thought by Georges Cuvier to be tapir-like. Three species were represented by each individual sculpture: the small-size P. minor (= Plagiolophus minor), the medium-size P. medium, and the largest and most robust-appearing P. magnum, all of which were studied by Cuvier. They have suffered the most wear and tear of all of the models, and the standing model no longer looked much like the original made by Hawkins. During the 1960s these models were lying discarded in the bushes about fifty yards from the original site and, prior to the 2002 restoration, they were in such bad shape that they were removed and put into store. Some sources state that these models were added at a later date, but an Illustrated London News illustration of Hawkins's workshop shows them in the background. A replica of P. magnum was commissioned by the Friends of Crystal Palace Dinosaurs and built by palaeoartist Bob Nicholls, and unveiled to the public on 2 July 2023.\nModels of the \"fearfully great bird\" Dinornis of New Zealand (extinct by 1500 AD), and of the extinct elephant-like Mastodon (or Deinotherium of the Miocene and Pliocene of Eurasia and Africa), were planned for the 'Tertiary Islands' but not completed.\n\n\n== In culture ==\n\nCharles Dickens's 1853 novel, Bleak House, begins with a description of muddy streets, whose primordial character is emphasized by a dinosaur in the streets of London:\n\n\"Implacable November weather. As much mud in the streets as if the waters had but newly retired from the face of the earth, and it would not be wonderful to meet a Megalosaurus, forty feet long or so, waddling like an elephantine lizard up Holborn Hill.\"\nIn H. G. Wells's 1905 novel Kipps, Kipps and Ann visit Crystal Palace and sit \"in the presence of the green and gold Labyrinthodon that looms so splendidly above the lake\" to discuss their future. There is a brief description of the dinosaurs and their surroundings and the impact they have on the characters. Several of E. Nesbit's children's books feature the Crystal Palace dinosaur sculptures coming to life, including The Enchanted Castle (1907). The 1932 novel Have His Carcase, by Dorothy L. Sayers, has the character Lord Peter Wimsey mention the \"antediluvian monsters\" of the Crystal Palace. Ann Coates's 1970 children's book Dinosaurs Don't Die, illustrated by John Vernon Lord, tells the story of a young boy who lives near Crystal Palace Park and discovers that Hawkins' models come to life; he befriends one of the Iguanodon and names it 'Rock' and they visit the Natural History Museum.\nThe travel writer Paul Theroux mentions the dinosaurs in his 1989 novel My Secret History. The novel's narrator, Andre Parent, accidentally learns of his wife's infidelity when his young son, Jack, reveals that he has visited the dinosaurs in the company of his mother's 'friend' during Andre's prolonged absence gathering material for a travel book. The title story in Penelope Lively's 1991 novel Fanny and the Monsters is about a Victorian girl who visits the Crystal Palace dinosaurs and becomes fascinated by prehistoric creatures.\nGeorge Baxter, a pioneer of colour printing, made a well-known engraving which imagines Crystal Palace, set in its landscaped grounds with tall fountains and the dinosaurs in the foreground, before the 1854 opening.\nIn 2023, Historic England created three-dimensional photogrammetric models of the 29 sculptures. The models can be viewed online.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of dinosaur parks\nList of public art in Bromley\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nMcCarthy, Steve; Gilbert, Mick (1994).

    "wikipediaText": "St John's Downshire Hill, Hampstead, is a proprietary chapel of the Church of England, located in Downshire Hill, Hampstead, London, in the Parish of St Stephen with All Hallows. Referred to as St John's Church, the building is formally a chapel. The church should not be confused with St John-at-Hampstead, which is located in Church Row, Hampstead, being the parish church of what is now the neighbouring parish.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Construction and first services ===\nDuring a period in which much of the surrounding area was being developed, a new church was considered as an essential local amenity. The copyhold for the site of the church on Downshire Hill was purchased from the Manor of Belsize in 1812 by a group which passed this in 1817 to a trio comprising Christian minister James Curry, \"speculative\" builder William Woods and lawyer Edward Carlisle, Woods being involved in other development, both in Hampstead and elsewhere in London. Curry had offered to pay the cost of the building project if he was appointed minister. The dedication of the new church to St John may indicate that it was originally intended as a chapel of ease for the parish church of St John-at-Hampstead.\nThe building was completed in 1823, with the first service held on 26 October 1823. The first minister of the church was William Harness, a lifelong friend of Lord Byron (Curry had fallen ill by the time of the church's opening, and died soon after the opening; Woods also surrendered his interest in the building in January 1824). Harness departed in 1825 and was followed by a group of four ministers who remained for only short period.\n\n\n=== Controversy in 1832 ===\nIn 1832, the copyhold was purchased by John Wilcox, an admirer of George Whitefield, with the aid of a loan from a local dissenter. Wilcox established evangelical ministry at the church, but encountered opposition from Samuel White, perpetual curate of the parish of St John, Hampstead, whose permission was required to conduct services in the parish, since Downshire Hill was at that time located in the same parish. Unlike Wilcox, who was the son of a Gloucester publican, White had effectively inherited his curacy in Hampstead from his father, and a contemporary periodical noted theological differences between White and Wilcox's Calvinist doctrinal position. Wilcox had made known that he would preach as a dissenter if not given permission to as an Anglican minister and, after he ignored a letter from White informing him he did not have White's permission to officiate at services at St John's Downshire Hill, White began proceedings against Wilcox for officiating without the permission of the incumbent.\nA consistory court ruled in favour of White, but local feeling was on the side of Wilcox. The poet John Keats, who was living nearby at the time in what is now Keats House had earlier referred to White as \"the Person of Hampstead quarrelling with all the world\" and a petition was organised and signed by influential local people including the then Lord of the Manor of Belsize, Lord Galloway, and Sara Coleridge. The outcome of the case also attracted strong criticism at the time in the Church of England magazine:\n\n\"In the existing state, therefore, of our Ecclesiastical law, a clergyman may incur every penalty for preaching, praying and administering the Sacrament, which he could incur were he guilty of adultery, drunkenness, profane swearing, or other outrageous and abominable conduct... It will be observed that this decision has no reference whatever to any real or supposed want of religious instruction in the parish...[T]he existing chapel on Downshire Hill may perish with the dry rot â may be turned into... a Ballroom, a Theatre or a Gambling House, but according to existing law, it can never be opened as a place of worship for the Church of England, until the Incumbent of the parish gives consent.\"\nThe decision of the court prevailed, with the church closing until 1835. The church's name remained infamous in ecclesiastical circles for some years following. Wilcox remained in the area during this time, apparently devoting his time to educating local children at a St John's Church School which he had founded at his own expense, also on Downshire Hill, before dying in December 1835.\n\n\n=== 1835â1916 ===\nIn 1835, an alternative minister was found who was approved of by Dr White: John Ayre was minister of St John's between 1835 and 1855; he remained the longest-standing minister of St John's for many years after.\nIn 1862, the copyhold of the church was converted to a freehold, following a payment by the official copyholder at that time.\nWith the need for increased capacity to accommodate churchgoers, a new parish church in the area was planned. In 1863, St John's was proposed as the new parish church. The proposal was rejected on the grounds that the 900 capacity of the church was too small, although in 1851 1,370 attended a service with a sermon delivered by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The plot was also considered too small to rebuild a larger church which led to a new parish church being built nearby at Rosslyn Hill named St. Stephen's, with the then minister of St John's Downshire Hill, Joshua Kirkman, becoming the first vicar of St. Stephen's.\nThe scholar Robert Baker Girdlestone was minister of St John's from 1889 to 1903.\n\n\n=== 1916âpresent ===\nIn 1916, following financial difficulties during the First World War, the freehold was bought by Mr Albert Leslie Wright, the son of Rev. Henry Wright who had been the minister 1872â1880. Leslie Wright then leased the church back to the congregation for a nominal rent. In his will he directed that trustees \"postpone the sale of the said chapel so long as there is sufficient congregation\", with the choice of trustees (CPAS) ensuring that the church would continue along evangelical lines following his death. Leslie Wright died in 1938, with the church continuing to operate according to these provisions until the freehold of the property was purchased by the congregation from Wright's trustees in 2003.\nThe church has had strong links to overseas Christian mission, with Rev. Henry Wright beginning an enduring link with the Church Missionary Society, donations to missionary societies forming the largest item of expenditure annually from the earliest church records (1872) until World War I, and various ministers involved in overseas missionary work, including Douglas Butcher (1957â1960, was Honorary Canon of Cairo cathedral and later returned to the Middle East), Douglas Paterson (1962â1965, later joined the Ruanda Mission) and Kenneth Howell (1972â1979, earlier first Bishop of Chile, Bolivia and Peru).\nTom Watts was licensed as the senior minister of St John's in January 2018.\nThe chapel stands in the conservative evangelical tradition, and has passed resolutions rejecting the leadership and/or ordination of women. It receives alternative episcopal oversight from the Bishop of Ebbsfleet (currently Rob Munro).\n\n\n== Building ==\nThe church building is Grade I listed and has a Regency stuccoed, cream-painted facade. Its notable features include a Doric porch, portico and cupola and a double-staircased vestibule. The main auditorium features a five-bay nave and galleries on three sides.\nThe church has no recessed chancel, inscribed panels (previously along with a prominent pulpit and small communion table, although these are no longer present), along with a frieze of biblical text (in gold lettering). The features are characteristic of the emphasis on preaching in evangelical Anglican churches during the period of initial construction.\nThe original wooden box pews are still present in the church. The pews were moved to the sides of the church during the renovation of 2003â4.\nThe east window features an eagle, a symbol of St John and the biblical gospel. There is a Bevington & Sons organ in the west gallery, built in 1873 and installed in 1880. The clock on the front of the building was made in 1823 by John Moore and Son of Clerkenwell.\nThe building received major renovations in 1896, 1950 (following war damage), 1973, 1982 and 2004, in each case following fundraising appeals. During the 2003-4 renovations, foundations were put in and an undercroft constructed.\n\n\n== As the sole proprietary chapel in the Diocese of London ==\nAlthough in the 19th century, there were upwards of 50 proprietary chapels in London, St John's Downshire Hill is now the only proprietary chapel remaining in the present Diocese of London, and one of only a handful in the whole of England. As such, it is effectively financially independent of the Church of England, neither contributing or receiving from Diocese funds. The ongoing running costs, including the costs of employing its full-time staff and the upkeep of the building, are provided entirely by the present congregation.\n\n\n== References and Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website"

Tall, narrow windows in centre of     \n          various types, irregularly set. On the extreme right,       \n          single-storey entrance porch with rubbed brick surround to  \n          front (position of original entrance) and overhanging carved\n          timber hood in style of Wren to return (current position of \n          entrance).

    "wikipediaText": "St Etheldreda's Church is a Catholic church in Ely Place, off Charterhouse Street in Holborn, London. The building is one of only two surviving in London from the reign of Edward I, and dates from between 1250 and 1290. It is dedicated to Ãthelthryth, or Etheldreda, the Anglo-Saxon saint who founded the monastery at Ely in 673.  It was the chapel of the London residence of the Bishops of Ely.\nIn the early 17th century it served briefly as an embassy chapel for the Spanish Ambassador, and a haven for English Catholics. The chapel was purchased by the Catholic Church in 1874 and opened in 1878 and is one of the oldest churches in England to be in current use by the Catholic Church.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nSt Etheldreda's consists of a chapel, or upper church, and a crypt  or undercroft, and is active and used for Masses, baptisms, weddings, and funerals. Because Saint Etheldreda was often invoked for help with infections of the throat, the Blessing of the Throats is held annually at the chapel.\nThe Catholic chapel at the United States Military Academy, West Point, is modelled on St Etheldreda's.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 13th century ===\nSt Etheldreda's was built some time between 1250 and 1290 as the town chapel for the Bishops of Ely. It was part of Ely Palace or Ely House, their London residence.\n\n\n=== 14th century ===\nIn 1302, John, Earl of Warenne, swore his loyalty to Edward II in the chapel.\nIn 1381 John of Gaunt moved to the palace, after the Savoy Palace was destroyed during the Peasants' Revolt.\n\n\n=== 16th century ===\nIn 1534, Catholic Masses were outlawed in England. The Bishops of Ely continued to oversee the chapel, which was used for Anglican worship after the English Reformation.\nIn 1576 a lease on a portion of the house and lands surrounding the chapel was granted by Richard Cox, Bishop of Ely, to Sir Christopher Hatton, a favourite of Elizabeth I. The rent was Â£10, ten loads of hay and one red rose per year, a small enough sum to give rise to suspicion that Elizabeth had put pressure on the bishop. Hatton borrowed extensively from the crown to pay for refurbishment and upkeep of the property. During his tenancy, the crypt was used as a tavern.\nEly Palace is mentioned in two of Shakespeare's plays, Richard II and Richard III.\n\n\n=== 17th century ===\nIn 1620, the upper church was granted to Count Gondomar, the Spanish ambassador, to use as a private chapel, and was considered to be on Spanish soil. Catholic worship, still illegal in England, was allowed in the church. Two years later, during a diplomatic dispute between England and Spain, Gondomar was recalled to Spain and use of the chapel was not given to his successor.\nMatthew Wren, Bishop of Ely from 1638 (and uncle of Christopher Wren), worshipped at St Etheldreda's chapel  before his imprisonment in 1641.\nIn 1642, the palace and church was requisitioned by Parliament for use as a prison and hospital during the English Civil War. During Oliver Cromwell's Commonwealth (1649â1660) most of the palace was demolished and the gardens were destroyed.\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\n\nIn 1772, the Crown Lands in Fenchurch Street, London Act 1772 allowed the Bishops of Ely to sell the property to the Crown. The site, including the chapel, was sold on to Charles Cole, a surveyor and architect. He demolished all the buildings on the site apart from the chapel and built Ely Place. The chapel was extensively refurbished in the Georgian style before it re-opened in 1786.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nIn 1820 the chapel was taken over by the National Society for the Education of the Poor who hoped to convert the Irish Catholic immigrants then settling in the area. A short time later the church closed.\nIn 1836, Ely Chapel was reopened by the Reverend Alexander D'Arblay (son of Fanny Burney) as a place of Anglican worship but he died the following year. In 1843, the church was leased by Welsh Anglicans with services celebrated in the Welsh language. The chapel was put up for auction in 1874 and purchased for Â£5,400 by the Catholic convert Father William Lockhart of the Rosminian order.\nUnder Lockhart's direction, the crypt and upper church were restored by George Gilbert Scott to their original 13th-century designs. John Francis Bentley designed a choir screen incorporating a confessional, an organ and a choir gallery. The royal coat of arms, added during the reign of Charles I, was removed to the cloister. The church received a relic from the Duke of Norfolk: a piece of Saint Etheldreda's hand, which is kept in a jewel cask to the right of the high altar.\nThe restoration was completed in 1878 and a Catholic Mass was celebrated in St Ethelreda's for the first time in over 200 years. The upper church was reopened in 1879 on the Feast of Saint Etheldreda (23 June).\nFor many years, St Etheldreda's church was the oldest Catholic church building in England, but since 1971 it has been surpassed by the 12th-century church of Ss Leonard & Mary in Malton, North Yorkshire.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn 1925, the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments scheduled the chapel as an ancient monument.\nIn May 1941, during the Blitz, the church was hit by a bomb that tore a hole in the roof and destroyed the Victorian stained glass windows. It took seven years to repair the structural damage.\nIn 1952, new stained glass by Joseph Nuttgens was installed in the east window. It features the Trinity, the evangelists Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, as well as the Virgin Mary and Saints Joseph, Bridget of Kildare and Etheldreda. The stained glass windows in the south wall depict scenes from the Old Testament, and the ones in the north wall show scenes from the New Testament.\nIn the 1960s, two groups of four statues of English Catholic martyrs from the time of Henry VIII and Elizabeth I were installed along the north and south walls. They include Saint Edmund Gennings, Saint Swithun Wells, Saint Margaret Ward, Blessed John Forest, Blessed Edward Jones, Blessed John Roche, Saint Anne Line, and Saint John Houghton.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2011, the Catholic Church proposed that St Anne's Church, Laxton Place, be used as the principal church of the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham. The journalist Damian Thompson, a prominent supporter of the ordinariate, called for St Etheldreda's to be used by the ordinariate, asserting that the church suffered a decline, both liturgically and as a parish community, in the early years of the 21st century.\nFather Kit Cunningham, for some 30 years the rector of St Etheldreda's, was awarded the MBE in 1998. Cunningham returned the MBE before his death in 2010. It was subsequently revealed in June 2011 that Cunningham had sexually abused young boys at a school in Tanzania.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nEmbassy chapel\nSardinian Embassy Chapel\nSt James's, Spanish Place\nList of buildings that survived the Great Fire of London\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSt Etheldreda's, Ely Place: A Pitkin Guide, by Fr Kit Cunningham with Rosemary Nibbs (Norwich: Jarrold Publishing, 2003)\nA notice of Ely chapel, Holborn: with some account of Ely palace by Thomas Boyles Murray (1840)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nInformation and  images\nArticle on St Etheldreda's on the Magical Statistics website\nDescription of St Etheldreda's on the Frommers website\n\"Mystery Worshipper\" report about St Ethelredra's on the Ship of Fools website Archived 12 April 2017 at the Wayback Machine\n360Â° panorama of Church interiors"

    "wikipediaText": "King's Cross railway station, also known as London King's Cross, is a passenger railway terminus in the London Borough of Camden, on the edge of Central London. It is in the London station group, one of the busiest stations in the United Kingdom and the southern terminus of the East Coast Main Line to Yorkshire and the Humber, North East England and Scotland. Adjacent to King's Cross station is St Pancras International, the London terminus for Eurostar services to continental Europe. Beneath both main line stations is King's Cross St Pancras tube station on the London Underground; combined, they form one of the country's largest and busiest transport hubs.\nThe station was opened in Kings Cross in 1852 by the Great Northern Railway on the northern edge of Central London to accommodate the East Coast Main Line. It quickly grew to cater to suburban lines and was expanded several times in the 19th century. As part of the Big Four grouping in 1923, it came under the ownership of the London and North Eastern Railway,  who introduced famous services such as the Flying Scotsman and locomotives such as Mallard. The station complex was redeveloped in the 1970s, simplifying the layout and providing electric suburban services, and it became a major terminus for the high-speed InterCity 125. As of 2018, long-distance trains from King's Cross are run by London North Eastern Railway  to Edinburgh Waverley, Leeds and Newcastle; other long-distance operators include Hull Trains and Grand Central. In addition, Great Northern runs suburban commuter trains around North London, Hertfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Norfolk.\nIn the late 20th century, the area around the station became known for its seedy and downmarket character, and was used as a backdrop for several films as a result. A major redevelopment was undertaken in the 21st century, including restoration of the original roof, and the station became well known for its association with the Harry Potter books and films, particularly the fictional Platform 9+3â4.\n\n\n== Location and name ==\nThe station stands on the London Inner Ring Road at the eastern end of Euston Road, next to the junction with Pentonville Road, Gray's Inn Road and York Way, in what is now the London Borough of Camden. Immediately to the west, on the other side of Pancras Road, is St Pancras railway station. Several London bus routes, including 30, 59, 73, 91, 205, 390 and 476 pass in front of or to the side of the station.\nKing's Cross can be spelled both with and without an apostrophe. King's Cross is used in signage at the Network Rail and London Underground stations, on the Tube map and on the official Network Rail webpage. Kings Cross is used on the National Rail website. The apostrophe rarely featured on early Underground maps, but has been consistently used on them since 1951. Kings X, Kings + and London KX are abbreviations used in space-limited contexts. The National Rail station code is KGX.\n\n\n== Station Layout ==\nThe station currently has 11 platforms, numbered 0 to 10 from east to west. Platforms 9 and 10 are short platforms and separated from platforms 0 to 8. Until 2021 there were 12 platforms, numbered 0 to 11 from east to west, but following extensive track remodelling, platform 10 was taken out of use, with platform 11 being relabelled 10.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe area of King's Cross was previously a village known as Battle Bridge which was an ancient crossing of the River Fleet, originally known as Broad Ford, later Bradford Bridge. The river flowed along what is now the west side of Pancras Road until it was rerouted underground in 1825. The name \"Battle Bridge\" is linked to tradition that this was the site of a major battle between the Romans and the Celtic British Iceni tribe led by Boudica. According to folklore, King's Cross is the site of Boudica's final battle and some sources say she is buried under one of the platforms. Platforms 9 and 10 have been suggested as possible sites. Boudica's ghost is also reported to haunt passages under the station, around platforms 8â10.\n\n\n=== Great Northern Railway (1850â1923) ===\n\nKing's Cross station was built in 1851â52 as the London terminus of the Great Northern Railway (GNR), and was the fifth London terminal to be constructed. It replaced a temporary station next to Maiden Lane (now York Way) that had been quickly constructed with the line's arrival in London in 1850, and had opened on 7 August 1850.\nThe station took its name from the King's Cross building, a monument to King George IV that stood in the area and was demolished in 1845. Construction was on the site of a smallpox hospital.\nPlans for the station were made in December 1848 under the direction of George Turnbull, resident engineer for constructing the first 20 miles (32 km) of the Great Northern Railway out of London. The station's detailed design was by Lewis Cubitt, the brother of Thomas Cubitt (the architect of Bloomsbury, Belgravia and Osborne House), and Sir William Cubitt (who was chief engineer of the Crystal Palace built in 1851, and consulting engineer to the Great Northern and South Eastern Railways). The design comprised two great arched train sheds, with a brick structure at the south end designed to reflect the arches behind. Its main feature was a 112-foot (34 m) high clock tower that held treble, tenor and bass bells, the last of these weighing 1 ton 9 cwt (1.47 tonnes). In size, it was inspired by the 200 yards (180 m) long Moscow Riding Academy of 1825, leading to its built length of 268 yards (245 m).\n\nThe station, the biggest in England at that time, opened on 14 October 1852. Originally it had one arrival and one departure platform (today's platforms 1 and 8), and the space between was used for carriage sidings. The platforms have been reconfigured several times. They were numbered 1 to 8 in 1972. In 2010 and 2021 the station was reconfigured again and now has 11 platforms numbered 0 - 10. Suburban traffic quickly grew with the opening of stations at Hornsey in 1850, Holloway Road in 1856, Wood Green in 1859 and Seven Sisters Road (now Finsbury Park) in 1861. Midland Railway services to Leicester via Hitchin and Bedford began running from King's Cross on 1 February 1858. More platforms were added in 1862: No. 2 was full-length, but No. 3 was stepped into the northern end of the station. In 1866, a connection was made via the Metropolitan Railway to the London, Chatham and Dover Railway at Farringdon, with goods and passenger services to South London via Herne Hill. A separate suburban station to the west of the main building, housing platforms 9â11 as of 1972 and known initially as \"Kings Cross Main Line (Local) Station\", opened in August 1875. It was followed by a connection to the Metropolitan line on 1 February 1878. Two platforms (now 5 and 6) were opened on 18 December 1893 to cater for increased traffic demands. An iron footbridge was built halfway down the train shed to connect all the platforms. By 1880, half the traffic at King's Cross was suburban.\nA significant bottleneck in the early years of operations was at Gas Works tunnel underneath the Regent's Canal immediately to the north of the station, which was built with a single up track and a single down track. Commercial traffic was further impeded by having to cross over on-level running lines to reach the goods yard. Grade separation of goods traffic was achieved by constructing the skew bridge that opened in August 1877, and the second and third Gas Works tunnels opened in 1878 and 1892 respectively.\nOn 15 September 1881, a light engine and a coal train collided near the mouth of the Copenhagen Tunnel north of the station because of a signalman's error. One person was killed and another was severely injured. Bad weather contributed to occasional flooding in the tunnels. One such incident in July 1901 suspended all traffic from the station for more than four hours, which happened at no other London terminus.\nKing's Cross sustained no damage during World War I even though large amounts of high explosives were carried to the station in passenger trains during the war. When possible, trains were parked in tunnels in the event of enemy aircraft overhead.\n\n\n=== London and North Eastern Railway (1923â1948) ===\n\nKings Cross came into the ownership of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) following the Railways Act 1921. The LNER made improvements to various amenities, including toilets and dressing rooms underneath what is now platform 8. The lines through the Gas Works tunnels were remodelled between 1922 and 1924 and improved signalling made it easier to manage the increasing number of local trains.\nA number of famous trains have been associated with King's Cross, such as the Flying Scotsman service to Edinburgh. The Gresley A3 and later streamlined A4 Pacific steam locomotives handled express services from the 1930s until 1966. The most famous of these was Mallard, which holds the world speed record for steam locomotives at 126 miles per hour (203 km/h), set in 1938.\nKing's Cross handled large numbers of troops alongside civilian traffic during World War II. Engine shortages meant that up to 2,000 people had to be accommodated on each train. In the early hours of Sunday 11 May 1941, two 1,000 pounds (450 kg) bombs fell on the, then, platform 10 at the west side of the station, damaging a newspaper train in that platform and destroying the general offices, booking hall and a bar, and bringing down a large section of roof. Twelve people were killed.\nOn 4 February 1945, a passenger train to Leeds and Bradford stalled in Gasworks Tunnel, ran back and was derailed in the station. Two people were killed and 25 were injured. Services were not fully restored until 23 February.\n\n\n=== British Rail (1948â1996) ===\n\nFollowing nationalisation on 1 January 1948, King's Cross came under the management of British Railways' Eastern Region. Diesel services were introduced during the 1950s when steam was being phased out. All main line services were converted to diesel by June 1963. Platform numbers were reorganised in 1972, to run consecutively from 1 (east) to 14 (west). The track layout was simplified in the 1970s by reusing an old flyover for freight near the Copenhagen Tunnels at Holloway, and reducing the number of running lines through the Gas Works tunnels from six to four. At the same time, electrification started with the installation of a 25 kV overhead line to cater for suburban services as part of the Great Northern Suburban Electrification project. The works were completed on 3 April 1977, and electric services began running from King's Cross to Hertford, Welwyn Garden City and Royston\nThe construction of the Victoria line and its interchange at King's Cross was seen by British Rail as an opportunity to modernise the station. A single-storey extension containing the main passenger concourse and ticket office, designed in-house, was built at the front of the station in 1972. Although intended to be temporary, it was still standing 40 years later, obscuring the Grade I-listed faÃ§ade of the original station. Before the extension was built, the faÃ§ade was hidden behind a small terrace of shops. The extension was demolished in late 2012, revealing the Lewis Cubitt architecture. In its place, the 75,000-square-foot (7,000 m2) King's Cross Square was created, and opened to the public on 26 September 2013.\nOn 10 September 1973, a Provisional IRA bomb exploded in the booking hall at 12.24 p.m., causing extensive damage and injuring six people, some seriously. The 3 lb (1.4 kg) device was thrown without warning by a youth who escaped into the crowd and was not caught.\nKing's Cross was a London terminus for InterCity 125 high speed services, along with Paddington. By 1982, almost all long-distance trains leaving King's Cross were 125s. The service proved to be popular, and the station saw regular queues across the concourse to board departing trains.\nThe King's Cross fire in 1987 started in the machine room for a wooden escalator between the main line station and the London Underground station's Piccadilly line platforms. The escalator burned and much of the tube station caught fire, killing 31 people, with smoke spreading to the main line station.\nIn 1987, British Rail proposed building a new station with four platforms for international trains through the Channel Tunnel, and four for Thameslink trains under King's Cross. After six years of design work, the plans were abandoned, and the international terminal was constructed at St Pancras.\nBritish Rail completed electrification of the East Coast Main Line to Leeds and Edinburgh between 1985 and 1991, and electric InterCity 225 rolling stock was introduced to work express services. These began service between King's Cross and Leeds on 2 October 1989, and to Edinburgh on 8 July 1991.\n\n\n=== Privatisation (1996âpresent) ===\n\nBefore privatisation, the King's Cross area had a reputation for run-down buildings and prostitution in front of the main entrance. There was a major clean-up during the 1990s and the station's atmosphere was much improved by the end of the decade.\nFollowing the privatisation of British Rail in 1996, express services into the station were taken over by the Great North Eastern Railway (GNER). The company refurbished the British Rail Mark 4 \"Mallard\" rolling stock used for long-distance services from King's Cross and the inauguration of the new-look trains took place in the presence of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh in 2003.\nGNER successfully re-bid for the franchise in 2005, but surrendered it in the following year. National Express East Coast took over the franchise in late 2007 after an interim period when trains ran under a management contract. In 2009, it was announced that National Express was no longer willing to finance the East Coast subsidiary, and the franchise was taken back into public ownership and handed over to East Coast in November. In March 2015 the franchise was re-privatised and taken over by Virgin Trains East Coast. In November 2017, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling announced the early termination of the East Coast franchise in 2020, three years ahead of schedule, following losses on the route by the operator. The current provider of ECML services is London North Eastern Railway.\n\n\n=== Restoration ===\n\nThe Â£500 million restoration plan announced by Network Rail in 2005 was approved by Camden London Borough Council in 2007. It involved restoring and reglazing the original arched train shed roof and removing the 1972 extension at the front of the station and replacing it with an open-air plaza.\nThe new semi-circular departures concourse opened to the public in March 2012. Situated to the west of the station behind the Great Northern Hotel, it was designed by John McAslan and built by Taylor Woodrow Construction, part of Vinci. It caters for much-increased passenger flows and provides greater integration between the intercity, suburban and underground sections of the station. The architect claimed that the roof is the longest single-span station structure in Europe and the semi-circular structure has a radius of 59 yards (54 m) and more than 2,000 triangular roof panels, half of which are glass.\n\nLand between and behind Kings Cross and St Pancras stations is being redeveloped as King's Cross Central with around 2,000 new homes, 5,000,000 sq ft (464,500 m2) of offices and new roads. In the restoration, refurbished offices have opened on the east side of the station to replace ones lost on the west side, and a new platform, numbered 0, opened underneath them on 20 May 2010. Diesel trains cannot normally use this platform for environmental reasons. The restoration project was awarded a European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Award in 2013.\nIn October 2021, Lumo commenced operating services to Edinburgh Waverley via Stevenage, Newcastle and Morpeth.\n\n\n=== Remodelling ===\nIn January 2018, it was announced that half the station would close for 3 months from January to March 2020 for remodelling work to the station and its approach, expected to cost Â£237 million. This includes rationalisation of the tracks, reopening the third tunnel to the approach of the station and closure of platform 10. In June 2021, Network Rail released a time lapse video showing the completion of the works.\n\n\n=== Accidents and incidents ===\n\nThere have been many passenger train accidents at King's Cross over the years. The most serious were the King's Cross railway accident on 4 February 1945 which killed two people and injured 25 and a collision in Gasworks Tunnel on 15 September 1881 which killed one person and seriously injured another. The most recent was on 17 September 2015 when a passenger train collided with the buffer stops, injuring fourteen people. There have also been a number of accidents which killed or injured railway employees.\nOn 5 November 1979, Martin Allen was seen saying goodbye to his friends at King's Cross. He set off in the direction of the Piccadilly line platform, but he was never seen again. The station is also where Andrew Gosden was last seen before going missing on 14 September 2007. He had caught a train there from Doncaster under controversial and unexplained circumstances.\n\n\n== Other stations ==\n\n\n=== King's Cross York Road ===\n\nFrom 1863, part of King's Cross was an intermediate station. On the extreme east of the site, King's Cross York Road station was served by suburban trains from Finsbury Park before they followed the sharply curved and steeply graded York Road Tunnel to join the City Widened Lines to Farringdon, Barbican and Moorgate. In the other direction, trains from Moorgate came off the Widened Lines via the Hotel Curve, to platform 16 (latterly renumbered 14) which rose to the main line level. Services to and from Moorgate were diverted via the Northern City Line from November 1976. The station remained in occasional use until it was completely closed on 5 March 1977.\n\n\n=== Great Northern Cemetery Station ===\nThe Great Northern Cemetery Station was built just to the east of the northern portal to Gasworks Tunnel, to connect the city to New Southgate Cemetery. It opened in 1861 but was never profitable as it only ran for 7 miles (11 km) and closed two years later.\n\n\n== Services ==\n\nThe station hosts services on inter-city routes to the East of England, Yorkshire, North East England and eastern and northern Scotland, connecting to major cities and towns such as Cambridge, Peterborough, Hull, Doncaster, Leeds, Bradford, York, Middlesbrough, Sunderland, Newcastle, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Inverness. Since June 2018, these major routes have been under government control, taking over from Stagecoach and Virgin.\n\n\n=== Train services ===\nFive train operating companies (TOC) run services from King's Cross:\n\n\n==== London North Eastern Railway ====\nLondon North Eastern Railway operates high speed inter-city services along the East Coast Main Line. The standard off-peak service pattern is as follows:\n\n1tph to Lincoln or York (alternating)\n2tph to Leeds, of which 1tp2h is extended further into West Yorkshire.\n1tph (fast service) to Edinburgh Waverley via Newcastle\n1tph (semi-fast service) to Edinburgh Waverley or Newcastle calling at most stations en route.\n\n\n==== Govia Thameslink Railway ====\nGovia Thameslink Railway operates outer-suburban services to North London, Hertfordshire, Cambridgeshire and West Norfolk under their Thameslink and Great Northern brands.\n\n2tph to Letchworth Garden City, with 1tph extending to Cambridge\n2tph to Cambridge (express services) extended to Ely or Kings Lynn (alternating)\nPeak times 2tph to Peterborough via Stevenage (express services)\n\n\n==== Hull Trains ====\nHull Trains operates five inter-city services per weekday to Hull and two per weekday to Beverley, via the East Coast Main Line. Unlike other train companies in FirstGroup, Hull Trains operates under an open-access arrangement and is not a franchised TOC.\n\n\n==== Grand Central ====\nGrand Central operates inter-city services to Bradford Interchange and Sunderland along the East Coast Main Line and is an open-access operator. On 23 May 2010, it began services to Bradford Interchange via Halifax, Brighouse, Mirfield, Wakefield, Pontefract and Doncaster The service had originally been due to begin in December 2009.\nOn MondayâFriday, there are four trains per day to Bradford Interchange (of which two will call at Pontefract Monkhill) and five trains per day to Sunderland.\n\n\n==== Lumo ====\nLumo, another FirstGroup open access operator, operates five services per day to Edinburgh via Newcastle and Morpeth. Two of the daily services also call to pick up passengers at Stevenage.\n\n\n=== Routes ===\n\n\n== London Underground station ==\n\nKing's Cross station shares a London Underground station with neighbouring St Pancras station. King's Cross St Pancras tube station is served by more lines than any other station on the London Underground. In 2023, King's Cross St Pancras was the most used station on the system, with 72.12 million passengers entering and exiting the station. It is in Travelcard Zone 1 and caters for both King's Cross and the neighbouring St Pancras railway station.\nThe station opened as part of the first section of Metropolitan Railway project on 10 January 1863; the first part of the Underground to open. A separate station for the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (now the Piccadilly line) opened on 15 December 1906, with the City & South London Railway (now the Northern line) opening on 12 May 1907. The Metropolitan line platforms were moved to their current location in 1941.\nThe Victoria line platforms were opened on 1 December 1968. A major expansion to accommodate High Speed 1 at St Pancras opened in November 2009.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n\n=== In fiction ===\nThe station is mentioned in Chapter 2 of E.M. Forster's 1910 novel Howards End, where it suggests \"infinity\" to the eldest Schlegel daughter, Margaret, and contrasted with the \"facile splendours\" of St. Pancras. In the Reverend Wilbert Awdry's 1957 children's book The Eight Famous Engines, Gordon the Big Engine undertakes a journey to London, hoping to reach King's Cross, but ends up at St Pancras instead.\nIn the 1994 children's book The Secret of Platform 13 by Eva Ibbotson. Platform 13 of King's Cross Station in London has been closed for years. Changes to the platform always result in failure for mysterious reasons. The reason is that the platform hides a gump, described as an \"opening that opens once every nine years for nine days\". The gump leads to the Island, a wonderful mythical paradise filled with both normal and magical creatures.\n\nKing's Cross features in the Harry Potter books, by J. K. Rowling, as the starting point of the Hogwarts Express. The train uses a secret Platform 9+3â4 accessed through the brick wall barrier between platforms 9 and 10. In fact, platforms 9 and 10 are in a separate building from the main station and are separated by two intervening tracks. Instead, the brick roof-support arches between platforms 4 and 5 were redressed by the film crew and used to represent a brick wall that does not exist between the real platforms 9 and 10.\nWithin King's Cross, a cast-iron \"Platform 9+3â4\" plaque was erected in 1999, initially in a passageway connecting the main station to the platform 9â11 annexe. Part of a luggage trolley was installed below the sign: the near end of the trolley was visible, but the rest had disappeared into the wall. The location quickly became a popular tourist spot amongst Harry Potter fans. The sign and a revamped trolley, complete with luggage and bird cage, were relocated in 2012, following the development of the new concourse building, and are now sited next to a Harry Potter merchandise shop. Because of the temporary buildings obscuring the faÃ§ade of the real King's Cross station until 2012, the Harry Potter films showed St. Pancras in exterior station shots instead.\nWhen The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Orlando Resort expanded to Universal Studios Florida, the Wizarding Worlds in both Diagon Alley at Universal Studios Florida and Hogsmeade at Universal's Islands of Adventure were connected with the Hogwarts Express. The Universal Studios Florida station is based on King's Cross station and Platform 9+3â4, including a quarter-scale replica of the faÃ§ade of King's Cross as the entrance to the station and it was opened on 8 July 2014 alongside Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts replacing the Jaws ride and the Amity Island themed area based on the Jaws franchise which was permanently closed on 2 January 2012.\n\n\n=== In film ===\nThe station, its surrounding streets and the railway approach feature prominently in the 1955 Ealing comedy film The Ladykillers. In the story, a gang robs a security van near the station after planning in a house overlooking the railway. When they fall out, members of the gang are dropped into passing goods wagons from the parapet of the Copenhagen Tunnel north of the station.\nThe 1986 crime drama film Mona Lisa is set around King's Cross. At the time, the downmarket and seedy area surrounding the station, coupled with urban decay, made it an ideal location. Subsequent early 1990s tabloid coverage of crime and prostitution around King's Cross referred back to the film.\nPet Shop Boys released a song titled \"King's Cross\" on the 1987 album Actually and the station was extensively filmed in for the group's 1988 feature film It Couldn't Happen Here. The band's singer Neil Tennant said that the station was a recognisable landmark coming into London, attempting to find opportunities away from the high unemployment areas of Northeast England at the time. The song was primarily about \"hopes being dashed\" and \"an epic nightmare\". The group subsequently asked filmmaker Derek Jarman to direct a background video for \"King's Cross\" for their 1989 tour, which featured a black and white sequence of juddery camera movements around the local area. Despite the song's reference to \"dead and wounded on either side\", it was actually released a few months before the King's Cross fire.\n\n\n=== Monopoly ===\nKing's Cross station is a square on the British Monopoly board. The other three stations in the game are Marylebone, Fenchurch Street and Liverpool Street, and all four were LNER termini at the time the game was being designed for the British market in the mid-1930s.\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nSources\n\n\n== External links ==\nHistory of Kings Cross, at the LNER Encyclopedia\nPictures of the new concourse opened in March 2012 (Evening Standard website)\n\"Article on new colour light signals, 1933\".

    "wikipediaText": "The Free Church is a building located in Hampstead Garden Suburb, Barnet, London. It was built to a design by Sir Edwin Lutyens starting in 1911, and, like St Jude's Church at the opposite side of Central Square, is a Grade I listed building.\n\n\n== History ==\nInitially, Christians in Hampstead Garden Suburb congregated together, but it was decided in 1909 to organise the Church of England and Free Church meetings separately. The Free Church first met, before the existence of the building, in 1909 and was officially founded in 1910.\nConstruction of the Free Church building was begun on 16 January 1911. It opened for worship on 25 October that year, though its West end was not completed until the 1960s. It was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the consultant architect for the Central Square of Hampstead Garden Suburb from 1906. He had influence on the design of the whole square, including both churches.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe church has a low concrete dome, by contrast to the spire of St Jude's. The interior features Tuscan columns with brick plinths, and a barrel vault. The interior is in pastel colours. The church has two war memorial panels designed by Percy Delf Smith.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Further reading ===\nMiller, Mervyn; Gray, Alexander Stuart (1 January 1992).

    "wikipediaText": "Vanbrugh Castle is a house designed and built by John Vanbrugh around 1719 for his own family. It is located on Maze Hill on the eastern edge of Greenwich Park in London, to the north of Blackheath, with views to the west past the Old Royal Naval College at Greenwich down to the Thames reaching as far as the Houses of Parliament.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Vanbrugh years ===\n\nThe castle was designed and built after Vanbrugh had been the architect of the baroque houses at Castle Howard and Blenheim Palace, and shortly after Vanbrugh succeeded his architectural mentor Christopher Wren as Surveyor to the Royal Naval Hospital in 1716. Vanbrugh took a lease of a 12-acre triangular site of the Westcombe estate from Sir Michael Biddulph, 2nd Baronet in 1718, now known as Vanbrugh Fields.\nIn contrast to the baroque style used for his professional commissions, he chose a more medieval, almost gothic, style for his own house. Built on the southwestern corner of the triangular site, it predates the first clearly Gothic Revival house at Strawberry Hill by 30 years. The main structure was finished in 1719, a three-storey square keep with basement built in brick with tall narrow windows, augmented on the south side square by three four-storey towers: two square flanking towers with battlements and a central projecting circular tower enclosing stairs capped by a conical copper roof.  An arched corbel table below the moulded parapet is a feature unique to Vanbrugh at this date, also found at Kings Weston House (1710â1725). The building's narrow sash windows echo medieval arrowslits or lancets. A garden on the building's lead roof makes the most of the views over the Thames and London.\nAged 55, Vanbrugh married the 26-year-old Henrietta Maria Yarborough in York in January 1719, and he soon added a wing to the east side of the house in a similar style, creating a lopsided, asymmetric construction â said to be the first asymmetric house built in Europe since the Renaissance. It has the \"castle air\" adopted in Vanbrugh's remodelling of Kimbolton Castle (1708â1719), and also used at Shirburn Castle, both early revivals of a medieval style of architecture.\nIt has been claimed that the design was based on the Bastille, where Vanbrugh had been imprisoned for over four years in his youth, and the building may have been referred to as Bastille House before it became better known as Vanbrugh Castle. Visitors from Greenwich would pass by other structures in the grounds designed and built by Vanbrugh â the Nunnery, a second smaller single-story house occupied by Vanbrugh's brother Philip; Mince-pie House or Vanbrugh House, occupied by his brother Charles; and later added two white towers made from patented white bricks, perhaps for his two sons â before reaching a crenelated gateway, with a second gatehouse on the Dover road to the south.\n\n\n=== Later history ===\nThe house passed through various owners after Vanbrugh's death in 1726. The next owner was Robert Holford (1686â1753) with his wife Sarah (nÃ©e Vanderput). The novelist Mary Anna Needell, nÃ©e Lupton, was born there in 1830. Further extensions to the main house were added in the late 19th and early 20th century, but Mince-Pie House was demolished in 1902 and the Nunnery was demolished in 1911. The house was occupied by engineer Dr Laurence Holker Potts from 1838, where he set up a laboratory creating equipment to treat spinal injuries. He left the house before his death in 1850.\nOil merchant Alexander Duckham, who bought the castle in 1907 as his London home, added a prominent weathervane shaped like a duck in flight. He donated the house (and Rooks Hill House in Sevenoaks) to the RAF Benevolent Fund in 1920 to be used as a school for the children of RAF personnel killed in service. Surprisingly, perhaps, the RAF school provided the choir for the Royal Naval College chapel, on the further side of Greenwich park. The boys were initially taught by Captain Slimming, in the only school room, before moving up to the nearby The John Roan School. The Wakefield Wing was added in 1938, but at the outbreak of war in 1939 the boys were evacuated to Rye and Bexhill. Once it was realised that any German invasion would most probably occur in that area, the school moved again to Wales. The building became Grade I listed property in October 1951. The choral conductor James William Webb-Jones was Headmaster of the school from 1951 to 1955. The choral musician Peter Stanley Lyons, who was simultaneously Director of Music at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, was Director of Music at Vanbrugh Castle School from 1950 to 1954. The school moved to Duke of Kent School in Ewhurst, Surrey in 1976. The house was then acquired by a group of four people for Â£100,000 and converted to four private flats.\nIn the 1980s, scenes from the film Mona Lisa were performed on location on the front circular driveway of Vanbrugh Castle.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Vanbrugh Castle at Wikimedia Commons\nModern architectural theory: a historical survey, 1673â1968, Harry Francis Mallgrave, Cambridge University Press, 2005, ISBN 0-521-79306-8, p. 47\nThe English House: The Story of a Nation at Home, Clive Aslet, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2009, ISBN 0-7475-7797-8, p. 99-104\nThe story of Greenwich, Clive Aslet, Harvard University Press, 1999, ISBN 0-674-00076-5, 182â4\nMap of Blackheath, 1740s\nOld and new London: a narrative of its history, its people, and its places"

Dark red brick with red rubbed brick and stone dressings and slate, originally tile, hipped roofs. \nPLAN: Symmetrical plan of a central founding range with lower side aisles, and N entrance tower with flanking blocks. \nEXTERIOR: 2 storeys and attic; 3-bay central tower with flanking single-storey; 2-bay range wings. Central tower has clasping pilasters on stone plinths, a fine entrance with pilasters of alternate rubbed brick and stone to a cornice set forward over the jambs, rusticated voussoirs to a round-arched doorway with the Duke of Marlborough's Arms to the key, radial fanlight and double doors with 10 raised panels; rubbed brick round arches with keys and imposts to C19 casements each side, segmental-arched blind panels above, and round-arched first-floor windows, flanking a wide 3-centre arched panel above the doorway with a fine coat of arms of George I. 3-bay sides with round-arched first-floor windows. Pyramidal roof with 2 pedimented dormers to the front, and a round lead-clad cupola, added 1722, with architraves to small-paned windows, angle buttresses and a dome with a finial. Single-storey side 'aisles' have round-arched windows linked by impost band and 3-centre-arched doorway, originally a central porch; the rear section is a 2-storey, 3-window former furnace block possibly raised 1770s, with contrasting paler brick clasping pilasters and window surrounds, round-arched ground-floor and segmental-arched first-floor windows. W side has a matching 2-storey rear block, but rebuilt c1878 to the N as a single-storey block with blind windows. S end has a 2-storey block with chamfered corners and parapet, possibly of 1803. Founding range has continuous clerestory windows beneath the eaves and louvred ridge vents. \nINTERIOR: an entrance hall with cast-iron plates to the inner wall, the top one inscribed TRANSFERRED TO ROYAL LABORATORY 1878, and a round-arched one over the doorway inscribed 177?/ VERBRUGGEN/J KING/H KING/1771 SCHALCH/KING/NORTH/ECCLES/1855; a C19 iron winder stair leads up to the tower, which has a heavy timber roof, and the flanking ground-floor bays have round arches to the S walls with imposts. The central founding range behind has a 9-bay king post roof with butt purlins, ridge vents, the 2 N trusses closed off, with mid-late C19 metal-trussed roof to the S end, and blind round arches to the sides. The E aisle has a steep roof with collar trusses with tie beams, butt purlins and a ridge board, with a cast-iron beam bolted to the W wall plate. \nHISTORY: Part of the initial expansion of the Arsenal after the Board of Ordnance set up its own foundry at Woolwich, with Dial Square and the Board Room (qqv). The foundry was built to cast brass cannon, and laid out on an axis facing the river. The furnaces were in the 2-storey ranges at the rear, with casting pits between and a gallery and windlass above, model and pattern-making to the north, with a large balance inside the main entrance, and had open arcades along the sides of the founding range, now blocked; the heavy roof, much of it original, was used for lifting, and there may have been a vertical cannon-boring machine in the tower. Verbruggen altered and extended it 1771-74 to accommodate a third foundry, although at this time advances in casting and boring iron were making brass cannon obsolete. In 1827 and 42, steam boring equipment replaced horse-powered mills of 1773/76. Of considerable historic significance as a rare, early and little-altered example of a purpose-built foundry and workshop, reworked at the start of the industrial revolution. \n(de Beer, Professor C, The Art of Gunfounding, Rotherfield, 1991; Pevsner N and Cherry B, The Buildings of England: London South, London, 1983, p.287; Hogg O F G, The Royal Arsenal, Oxford, 1963, pp.430, 626; RCHME report, 1994)\nListing NGR: TQ4373779063\n        \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n    \n        Legacy\n    \n    \n        The contents of this record have been generated from a legacy data system.\n    \n    \n        \n            Legacy System number:\n            \n                200487\n            \n        \n        \n            Legacy System:\n            \n                LBS\n            \n        \n    \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n                    Sources\n                \n                \n                    Books and journalsCherry, B, Pevsner, N, The Buildings of England: London 2: South, (1983), 287De Beer,  C, The Art of Gunfounding, (1991)Hogg,  O F G, The Royal Arsenal, (1963), 430'Historic Buildings Report' in The Royal Arsenal Woolwich, (1994)\n                \n\n\n\n                    \n                        \n\n\n    \n        Legal\n    \n\n\n    \n        This building is listed under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as amended for its special architectural or historic interest.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n\n            \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n            \n                Map\n            \n            \n                This map is for quick reference purposes only and may not be to scale.

    "wikipediaText": "Cutty Sark is a British clipper ship. Built on the River Leven, Dumbarton, Scotland in 1869 for the Jock Willis Shipping Line, she was one of the last tea clippers to be built and one of the fastest, at the end of a long period of design development for this type of vessel, which ended as steamships took over their routes. She was named after the short shirt of the fictional witch in Robert Burns' poem Tam o' Shanter, first published in 1791.\nAfter the big improvement in the fuel efficiency of steamships in 1866, the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 gave them a shorter route to China, so Cutty Sark spent only a few years on the tea trade before turning to the trade in wool from Australia, where she held the record time to Britain for ten years. Continuing improvements in steam technology early in the 1880s meant that steamships also came to dominate the longer sailing route to Australia, and the ship was sold to the Portuguese company Ferreira and Co. in 1895 and renamed Ferreira. She continued as a cargo ship until purchased in 1922 by retired sea captain Wilfred Dowman, who used her as a training ship operating from Falmouth, Cornwall. After his death, Cutty Sark was transferred to the Thames Nautical Training College, Greenhithe, in 1938 where she became an auxiliary cadet training ship alongside HMS Worcester. By 1954, she had ceased to be useful as a cadet ship and was transferred to permanent dry dock at Greenwich, London, for public display.\nCutty Sark is listed by National Historic Ships as part of the National Historic Fleet (the nautical equivalent of a Grade 1 Listed Building). She is one of only three remaining intact composite construction (wooden hull on an iron frame) ships from the nineteenth century, the others being the clipper City of Adelaide, now in Port Adelaide, South Australia, and the warship HMS Gannet in Chatham. The beached skeleton of Ambassador, of 1869 lying near Punta Arenas, Chile is the only other significant remnant of this construction method.\nThe ship has been damaged by fire twice in recent years, first on 21 May 2007 while undergoing conservation. She was restored and was reopened to the public on 25 April 2012. Funders for the Cutty Sark conservation project include: the Heritage Lottery Fund, the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, Sammy Ofer Foundation, Greenwich Council, Greater London Authority, The Stavros Niarchos Foundation, Berry Brothers & Rudd, Michael Edwards and Alisher Usmanov.\nOn 19 October 2014 she was damaged in a smaller fire.\nCutty Sark whisky derives its name from the ship. An image of the clipper appears on the label, and the maker formerly sponsored the Cutty Sark Tall Ships Race. The ship also inspired the name of the Saunders Roe Cutty Sark flying boat.\n\n\n== Construction ==\n\nCutty Sark was ordered by ship-owner John Willis, who operated a shipping company founded by his father. The company had several ships in the tea trade from China to Britain. Speed was an advantage to vessels carrying a high-value, seasonal product, such as tea. Faster ships could obtain higher rates of freight (the price paid to transport the cargo), and tea merchants would use the names of fast-sailing ships that had carried their products in their advertising.:â13â Cutty Sark was ordered during a boom in building tea clippers in the period 1865â1869âsomething that was attributed to a substantial reduction in the import duties for tea.:âintroductionâ In 1868 the brand-new Aberdeen-built clipper, Thermopylae, set a record time of 61 days port to port on her maiden voyage from London to Melbourne and it was this design that Willis set out to better.\nIt is uncertain how the hull shape for Cutty Sark was chosen. Willis chose Hercules Linton to design and build the ship but Willis already possessed another ship, The Tweed, which he considered to have exceptional performance. The Tweed (originally Punjaub) was a frigate designed by Oliver Lang based on the lines of an old French frigate, built in Bombay for the East India Company as a combination sail/paddle steamer. She and a sister ship were purchased by Willis, who promptly sold the second ship plus engines from The Tweed for more than he paid for both. The Tweed was then lengthened and operated as a fast sailing vessel, but was considered too big for the tea runs. Willis also commissioned two all-iron clippers with designs based upon The Tweed, Hallowe'en and Blackadder. Linton was taken to view The Tweed in dry dock.\nWillis considered that The Tweed's bow shape was responsible for her notable performance, and this form seems to have been adopted for Cutty Sark. Linton, however, felt that the stern was too barrel shaped and so gave Cutty Sark a squarer stern with less tumblehome. The broader stern increased the buoyancy of the ship's stern, making it lift more in heavy seas so it was less likely that waves would break over the stern, and over the helmsman at the wheel.:â20â24â Cutty Sark was given masts that followed the design of The Tweed, with similar good rake and the foremast on both placed further aft than usual.:â291â\nA contract for Cutty Sark's construction was signed on 1 February 1869 with the firm of Scott & Linton, which had only been formed in May 1868. Their shipyard was at Dumbarton on the River Leven on a site previously occupied by shipbuilders William Denny & Brothers. The contract required the ship to be completed within six months at a contracted price of Â£17 per ton and maximum size of 950 tons. This was a highly competitive price for an experimental, state-of-the-art vessel, and for a customer requiring the highest standards. Payment would be made in seven instalments as the ship progressed, but with a penalty of Â£5 for every day the ship was late. The ship was to be built to Lloyd's A1 standard and her construction was supervised on behalf of Willis by Captain George Moodie, who would command her when completed. Construction delays occurred when the Lloyd's inspectors required additional strengthening in the ship.\nWork on the ship was suspended when Scott and Linton ran out of money to continue. Rather than simply liquidate the company, an arrangement was made for Denny's to take over the contract and complete the ship, which was finally launched on 22 November 1869 by Captain Moodie's wife. The ship was moved to Denny's yard to have her masts fitted, and then on 20 December towed downriver to Greenock to have her running rigging installed. In the event, completing the ship meant the company's creditors were owed even more money than when work had first been halted.\n\nCutty Sark has a registered length of 212.5 feet (64.77 m), with a depth of hold of 21 feet (6.40 m) and a net tonnage of 921. The hull is one of the sharpest of all the tea clippers: she has a coefficient of under deck tonnage of 0.55, compared to Thermopylae at 0.58.:â195â199,â247â Cutty Sark's prismatic coefficient, another measure of hull sharpness, is 0.628; this allows comparison with US-built clippers studied by Howard I. Chapelle. After water-line length, the prismatic coefficient is the next most important determinant of potential hull speed. Unladen, or with a cargo of low density, ballast was required for stability. For example, when she was loaded with wool, 200 tons of ballast was carried. The largest wool cargo she ever carried was 900 tons' weight (the total of ballast and cargo of 1,100 tons is consistent with the estimated deadweight cargo capacity of 1,135 tons at 20-foot draught). The largest tea cargo carried was 615 tons' weight. Conversely, a dense cargo allowed full use of the deadweight capacity: if loaded with coal, she would usually carry 1,100 tons.:â187â\nBroadly, the parts of the ship visible above the waterline were constructed from East India teak, while American rock elm was used for the ship's bottom. The stem, 15 in Ã 15 in (38 cm Ã 38 cm), and sternpost, 16.5 in Ã 15 in (42 cm Ã 38 cm), were of teak while the rudder was of English oak. The keel was replaced in the 1920s with one constructed from 15-inch (38 cm) pitch pine. The deck was made of 3.5-inch (8.9 cm) thick teak while the 'tween deck was 3-inch (7.6 cm) yellow pine. The keel, 16.5 in Ã 15 in (42 cm Ã 38 cm), had on either side a garboard strake, 11 in Ã 12 in (28 cm Ã 30 cm), and then 6-inch (150 mm) planking decreasing to 4.75 in (12.1 cm) at one-fifth the depth of the hold. Teak planking began at approximately the level of the bilge stringer. The hull was covered by Muntz metal sheeting up to the 18-foot (5.5 m) depth mark, and all the external timbers were secured by Muntz metal bolts to the internal iron frame. The wrought-iron frame was an innovation first experimented with in shipbuilding in the 1840s, and was the standard building method for tea clippers by the middle of the 1860s.:â132â It consisted of frames (vertical), beams (horizontal) and cross bracing (diagonal members).\nThe diagonally-braced iron frame made for a strong, rigid ship; diagonal members prevent racking (shearing, where frame rectangles become parallelograms). Less working and leaking of the hull meant less crew time spent pumping, allowing more time to be spent on changes of sail. The wrought-iron-framed hull also took up less cargo space than an all-wood hull would have done. The Muntz metal sheeting reduced fouling of Cutty Sark's hull; with a cleaner hull, she could sail faster.\n\n\n== Performance ==\n\nThe maximum logged speed for Cutty Sark was 17.5 knots (32.4 km/h; 20.1 mph). Her greatest recorded distance in noon to noon sights was 363 nautical miles (672 km; 418 mi) averaging 15 knots (28 km/h; 17 mph), although she recorded 2,164 nautical miles (4,008 km; 2,490 mi) in six days, which given the weather over the whole period implied she had achieved over 370 nmi (690 km; 430 mi) some days. By comparison, Thermopylae's best recorded 24-hour distance was 358 nmi (663 km; 412 mi). On another occasion she recorded 3,457 nmi (6,402 km; 3,978 mi) in 11 days. Cutty Sark was considered to have the edge in a heavier wind, and Thermopylae in a lighter wind.:â155â157â\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe ship was named after Cutty-sark, the nickname of the witch Nannie Dee in Robert Burns's 1791 poem Tam o' Shanter. The ship's figurehead, the original of which has been attributed to carver Fredrick Hellyer of Blackwall, is a stark white carving of a bare-breasted Nannie Dee with long black hair holding a grey horse's tail in her hand. In the poem she wore a linen sark (Scots: a short chemise or undergarment), that she had been given as a child, which explains why it was cutty, or in other words far too short. The erotic sight of her dancing in such a short undergarment caused Tam to cry out \"Weel done, Cutty-sark\", which subsequently became a well-known catchphrase. Originally, carvings by Hellyer of the other scantily clad witches followed behind the figurehead along the bow, but these were removed by Willis in deference to 'good taste'. Tam o' Shanter riding Meg was to be seen along the ship's quarter. The motto \"Where theres a will is a way\" was inscribed along the taffrail, with variable spaces enabling also the reading Where there(')s a Willis away. The Tweed, which acted as a model for much of the ship which followed her, had a figurehead depicting Tam o' Shanter.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== First tea seasons ===\nCutty Sark was destined for the tea trade, a seasonal trade of a high-value cargo from China to London. Though the \"premium\" or bonus paid to the ship that arrived with the first tea of the year was abandoned after the Great Tea Race of 1866, faster ships could usually obtain a higher price for transporting their cargoes than others. Her first roundtrip voyage under captain George Moodie began 16 February 1870 from London with a cargo of wine, spirits and beer bound for Shanghai. The return journey, carrying 1,305,812 pounds (592,306 kg) of tea from Shanghai, began 25 June, arriving 13 October in London via the Cape of Good Hope.\nCutty Sark sailed in eight \"tea seasons\", from London to China and back.:â237â242â\n\n\n=== Competition from steamers ===\nCutty Sark's launch coincided with the opening of the Suez Canal to shipping in 1869. Her first trip encountered significant competition with steamships. The route from the Far East to London (and many other European ports) through the Suez Canal was shorter by about 3,300 nautical miles (6,100 km; 3,800 mi), compared to sailing round the Cape of Good Hope. The route round Africa is in excess of 14,000 nmi (26,000 km; 16,000 mi). Typically a clipper might log significantly more than that by planning her route for favourable winds. Whilst it was possible for a sailing vessel to take a tug through the canal, this was difficult and expensive. Furthermore, sailing conditions in the northern Red Sea were unsuited to the design of a tea clipper, so they still had to sail around Africa. The ability of a steamer to make, for example, 15 knots (28 km/h; 17 mph) continuously, versus the fastest clipper voyage averaging under 6.5 knots (12.0 km/h; 7.5 mph) over a longer distance, gave steamships not only a more predictable voyage time, but a substantially quicker one.\nLess obviously, steamship design had taken a large step forward in 1866 with Agamemnon, using higher boiler pressure and a compound engine, so obtaining a large improvement in fuel efficiency. Ships of this type could compete with clippers before the Suez Canal opened.\nWhen the tea clippers arrived in China in 1870, they found a big increase in the number of steamers, which were in high demand. The rate of freight to London that was given to steamers was nearly twice that paid to the sailing ships. Additionally, the insurance premium for a cargo of tea in a steamer was substantially less than for a sailing vessel. So successful were the steamers using the Suez Canal that, in 1871, 45 were built in Clyde shipyards alone for Far Eastern trade.:â209â\nThe numbers of tea clippers sailing to China each year steadily reduced, with many ships being sold and moving to general cargo work. Costs were kept to a minimum and rigs were often reduced to barque so that a smaller crew was needed.\n\n\n=== Thermopylae ===\nCutty Sark's well-known race against Thermopylae took place in 1872, the two ships leaving Shanghai together on 18 June. Both ships were of similar size: length, beam and depths were within one foot (0.3 m) of each other. The Thermopylae had a slightly larger capacity: 991 compared to 963 (GRT) or 948 compared to 921 (net). Two weeks later Cutty Sark had built up a lead of some 400 nautical miles (460 mi; 740 km), but then lost her rudder in a heavy gale after passing through the Sunda Strait. John Willis's brother was on board the ship and ordered Moodie to put into Cape Town for repairs. Moodie refused, and instead the ship's carpenter Henry Henderson constructed a new rudder from spare timbers and iron. This took six days, working in gales and heavy seas which meant the men were tossed about as they worked and the brazier used to heat the metal for working was spilled out, burning the captain's son. The ship finally arrived in London on 18 October a week after Thermopylae, a total passage of 122 days. The captain and crew were commended for their performance and Henderson received a Â£50 bonus for his work. This was the closest Cutty Sark came to being first ship home but it was Moodie's last trip as her captain before he transferred to steamships. He was replaced by Captain F. W. Moore.\n\n\n=== Later tea seasons ===\nMoore remained captain only for one round trip to China, taking 117 days for the return trip. This was 14 days longer than Thermopylae and 27 days longer than achieved by the iron ship Hallowe'en a few months later. Captain W. E. Tiptaft assumed command in 1873 achieving 118 days on his first return trip, but after the ship had to travel 600 nautical miles (1,100 km) up the Yangtze River in search of a cargo. Steamships were now taking most of the tea. The following year the return journey took 122 days. In November 1877 the ship was anchored off Deal in the English Channel along with sixty other vessels, waiting out a great storm. The anchor failed to hold and Cutty Sark was blown through the ships, damaging two others before grounding on a mud bank. Fortunately she was pulled clear by the tug Macgregor before too much damage was caused and she was towed to the Thames for repairs.\nIn December 1877 the ship sailed from London to Sydney, where she took on coal for Shanghai, arriving there in April. However, the ship was unable to find any cargo of tea for a return trip to Londonâthe days of the tea race were over. The master, Captain Tiptaft, died in October while still in Shanghai and was replaced by the first mate, James Wallace. The ship now had to take different cargoes around the world, including coal, jute, castor oil and tea to Australia.\nIn 1880 yards were shortened and the stun'sails removed. Also in 1880 an incident occurred on board during which the First Mate Sidney Smith killed seaman John Francis. Smith was allowed to leave the ship at Anjer by Captain Wallace, causing the crew to cease work in protest. Wallace continued the voyage with six apprentices and four tradesmen but became becalmed in the Java Sea for three days. In desperation as matters moved from bad to worse, he committed suicide by jumping overboard and disappeared. He was replaced as Master by William Bruce, who proved to be a drunken incompetent who claimed pay for non-existent crewmen and managed to set sail with inadequate provisions, resulting in the crew starving. An inquiry in New York in April 1882 resulted in the captain and mate being suspended and replaced by Captain Moore, previously of Blackadder.\n\n\n=== Wool trade ===\n\nIn December 1883, Cutty Sark departed Newcastle, New South Wales with 4,289 bales of wool and 12 casks of tallow, arriving in London in just 83 days. This was 25 days faster than her nearest rival that year and heralded the start of a new career taking Australian wool to Britain in time for the January wool sales.\nFrom 1885 to 1893, Cutty Sark was run between England and New South Wales under the agency of the Sydney-based Dangar, Gedye & Co. In 1885 Richard Woodget was appointed captain on a salary of Â£186 per year (Â£23,729.80 in 2019 when adjusted for inflation) and continued to improve on the fastest trip record, achieving 77 days on his first outward trip and 73 days returning to Britain from Australia. He achieved this by taking a more southerly route than previously, to catch the strongest winds in the Roaring Forties despite having to face icebergs, gales and storms whipped up by the winds he sought. Cutty Sark was the fastest ship on the wool trade for ten years. In July 1889 the log of the modern passenger steamship SS Britannia recorded that when steaming at 15 to 16 knots she was overtaken in the night by a sailing ship doing 17 knots, which proved to be Cutty Sark.\n\n\n=== As Ferreira ===\nEventually steamships began to dominate the wool trade too and it ceased to be profitable for a sailing ship. In 1895 Jock Willis sold Cutty Sark to the Portuguese firm Joaquim Antunes Ferreira for Â£1,250. She was renamed Ferreira after the firm. Her crews referred to her as Pequena Camisola (little shirt, a straight translation of the Scots cutty sark).\n\nThe ship traded various cargoes between Portugal, Rio de Janeiro, New Orleans, Mozambique, Angola, and Britain. In May 1916 she was dismasted off the Cape of Good Hope because of the rolling of the ship in bad weather and had to be towed into Table Bay off Cape Town. Because of World War I, it was impossible to obtain suitable materials to replace the masts so she was re-rigged over 18 months to a barquentine sail arrangement.\nIn 1922 Ferreira was the last clipper operating anywhere in the world. Caught in a storm in the English Channel she put into Falmouth harbour where she was spotted by retired merchant navy captain Wilfred Dowman of Flushing, Cornwall, who was then operating the training ship Lady of Avenel. The ship returned to Lisbon, where she was sold to new owners and renamed Maria do Amparo (Mary of the Refuge, a name associated with the devotion of Our Lady of the Refuge; in Portuguese, \"Nossa Senhora do Amparo\").\n\n\n=== As cadet training ship ===\nDowman persevered in his determination to buy the ship, which he did for Â£3,750 and she was returned to Falmouth harbour. The purchase was made with the support of Dowman's wife, artist Catharine Dowman (nÃ©e Courtauld), heiress daughter of Sydney Courtauld, crepe and silk manufacturer.\nThe rigging was restored to an approximation of the original arrangement and the ship was used as a cadet training ship. In 1924 she was used as committee boat for the regatta week in Fowey during that years regatta week as recalled to me by Mr. Arthur (Toby) West. As a historic survivor, the ship was opened to the public and visitors would be rowed out to inspect her. Dowman died in 1936 and the ship was given by Catharine Dowman, his widow, along with Â£5,000 for maintenance, to the Incorporated Thames Nautical Training College, HMS Worcester at Greenhithe. She was towed to Greenhithe by tug. The ship was crewed by cadets, 15-year-old Robert Wyld steering the ship during the voyage.\n\nAt Greenhithe, Cutty Sark acted as an auxiliary vessel to HMS Worcester for sail training drill, but by 1950 she had become surplus to requirements. From February to October 1951 she was temporarily moved first for a refit and then to take part in the Festival of Britain at Deptford. On 30 January 1952, the 800-ton tanker MV Aqueity collided with Cutty Sark's bow in the Thames. The two ships were locked together after the collision which forced Cutty Sark's jibboom into Worcester's forecastle rails, snapping the boom before scraping along Worcester's starboard side. Cutty Sark's figurehead lost an arm in the process. Worcester was a condemned hulk, sunk at her moorings at the time, photographs showing her lying on her starboard side with her starboard side near the shore. Cutty Sark was anchored and towed to the Shadwell Basin where repairs were carried out by Green & Silley Weir Ltd. The damaged arm was recovered at Grays Thurrock and the figurehead was repaired.\n\n\n== Museum ship ==\n\nIn 1953 Cutty Sark was given to the Cutty Sark Preservation Society and in 1954 she was moved to a custom-built dry dock at Greenwich. She was stripped of upper masts, yards, deck-houses and ballast to lighten her before being towed from the East India Import Dock to the special dry dock at Greenwich. The skipper on this occasion was 83-year-old Captain C.E. Irving, who had sailed the world three times in her before he was 17. The river pilot was Ernest Coe. Thereafter the entrance tunnel to the dry dock was filled in, the river wall rebuilt and the work of re-rigging began. The foundation stone of the dry dock was laid by The Duke of Edinburgh, patron of the Cutty Sark Preservation Society, in June 1953. The restoration, re-rigging and preparation for public exhibition was estimated to cost Â£250,000.\n\nCutty Sark was preserved as a museum ship, and has since become a popular tourist attraction, and part of the National Historic Fleet. She is located near the centre of Greenwich, in south-east London, close to the National Maritime Museum, the former Greenwich Hospital, and Greenwich Park. She is also a prominent landmark on the route of the London Marathon and marks the finish of The Big Half. She usually flies signal flags from her ensign halyard reading \"JKWS\", which is the code representing Cutty Sark in the International Code of Signals, introduced in 1857.\n\nThe ship is in the care of the Cutty Sark Trust, whose president, the then Duke of Edinburgh, was instrumental in ensuring her preservation, when he set up the Cutty Sark Society in 1951. The Trust replaced the Society in 2000. She is a Grade I listed monument and was on the Buildings at Risk Register following the 2007 fire. The gallery beneath the ship holds the world's largest collection of ships' figureheads, donated to the Society by Sydney Cumbers in 1953.\nCutty Sark station on the Docklands Light Railway is one minute's walk away, with connections to central London and the London Underground. Greenwich Pier is next to the ship, and is served by scheduled river boats from piers in central London. A tourist information office stands to the east of the ship.\n\n\n=== Conservation and fire ===\n\nBy the early 2000s, there were serious concerns about corrosion of the iron internal structure, and the hull was also becoming distorted because more weight was being carried on the keel than if the ship was afloat, when it would be evenly supported over the whole area below the waterline. An extensive conservation project was planned to overcome this, including repair and anti-corrosion painting of the framework and the addition of some additional steel ribs to add strength, and a new method of supporting the ship.\nOn the morning of 21 May 2007, Cutty Sark, which had been closed and partly dismantled for conservation work, caught fire, and burned for several hours before the London Fire Brigade could bring the fire under control. Initial reports indicated that the damage was extensive, with most of the wooden structure in the centre having been lost.\nIn an interview the next day, Richard Doughty, the chief executive of the Cutty Sark Trust, revealed that at least half of the \"fabric\" (timbers, etc.) of the ship had not been on site as it had been removed during the preservation work. Doughty stated that the trust was most worried about the state of iron framework to which the fabric was attached. He did not know how much more the ship would cost to restore, but estimated it at an additional Â£5â10 million, bringing the total cost of the ship's restoration to Â£30â35 million.\nIn initial investigations, the possibility was covered that the fire might have been started deliberately. The fire was later found to have most likely been caused by an industrial vacuum cleaner which had been left running over the weekend, compounded by the absence of the overnight fire watchers.\nIn a second incident on the morning of 19 October 2014, another fire broke out on the deck of the Cutty Sark. A small part of deck three and the hull timbers were damaged in the blaze. The London Fire Brigade managed to contain the blaze within an hour and she was reopened to the public shortly after.\n\n\n==== Damage ====\n\nAerial video footage showed extensive damage, but seemed to indicate that the ship had not been destroyed in her entirety by the 2007 fire. A fire officer present at the scene said in a BBC interview that when they arrived, there had been \"a well-developed fire throughout the ship\". The bow section looked to be relatively unscathed and the stern also appeared to have survived without major damage; the fire seemed to have been concentrated in the centre of the ship. The chairman of Cutty Sark Enterprises said after inspecting the site: \"The decks are unsalvageable but around 50% of the planking had already been removed; however, the damage is not as bad as originally expected.\"\nAs part of the restoration work planned before the fire, it was proposed that the ship be raised 3 metres (10 ft), to allow the construction of a state-of-the-art museum space beneath. This would allow visitors to view her from below.\nThere was criticism of the policies of the Cutty Sark Trust and its stance that the most important thing was to preserve as much as possible of the original fabric. Proponents of making her fit to go to sea advocated that the fire repairs be done in such a manner to enable her to do so.\nHowever, the state of the timbers, especially the keel, and the fact that a hole had been cut through the hull in the 1950s for an access door, made this difficult. The Cutty Sark Trust said that less than five percent of the original fabric was lost in the fire, as the decks which were destroyed were additions not present at the original building.\nThe restoration work was criticised by The Victorian Society saying that the needs of the corporate hospitality market were put ahead of the preservation of the historic fabric of the ship. Building Design magazine awarded the project its Carbuncle Cup for the worst new building completed in 2012 saying \"The scheme's myriad failings stem from one calamitous choice: the decision to hoick the 144-year-old clipper close to three metres into the air on canted steel props.\"\n\n\n==== Fundraising ====\n\nThe design for the renovation project by Grimshaw architects with, during design development stage, newly established Youmeheshe architects and Buro Happold engineers involved raising the ship out of her dry berth using a Kevlar web, allowing visitors to pass under the hull to view it. Unfortunately it was discovered that the proposed web would not follow the reverse curves of the ship's hull which would effectively mask the hull's shape from view. An alternate design for the support of the ship had to be developed; this involved installing a deep steel belt around the hull tied by diagonal steel members passing through the hold to a new steel-reinforced keel. Horizontal tubular steel struts passing through the hold brace the diagonals apart while many of the corroded original hull frames have been doubled.\nA new steelwork lower deck of contemporary design incorporating an amphitheatre feature was installed in the main hold while a glass-encased lift installed within the ship terminates in a new steel-and-glass housing structure on the weather deck. A second new steel-and-glass box has been installed above the forehold to enclose a new staircase. Access to the ship is through a new opening cut through the hull below the waterline in the ship's starboard quarter. The new access hole has required the addition of new steel framing. Visitors arriving on board the ship now do so via this entrance, which leads to the lower hold. Maldwin Drummond, Chairman of the Cutty Sark Trust, has explained in Classic Boat magazine's September 2010 issue the need to retain the spirit of the ship and he quotes the ideal that \"The visitor should see the ship as though for some unexplained reason the crew had gone ashore\". Doubts over the wisdom of Grimshaw's proposals have been raised by many ship conservationists including the Cutty Sark Trust's own engineer Peter Mason.\n\nThe project was costed at Â£25 million when it commenced in 2006 with Â£11.75 million of this total being provided by a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund.\nOscar-winning film producer Jerry Bruckheimer aided in the repair and restoration of Cutty Sark. A collection of photos taken by Bruckheimer went on display in London in November 2007 to help raise money for the Cutty Sark Conservation Project. The exhibition featured more than thirty pictures taken on set during the filming of Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.\nIn January 2008, the Heritage Lottery Fund awarded the Cutty Sark Trust another Â£10 million towards the restoration of the ship, meaning that the Trust had now achieved Â£30 million of the Â£35 million needed for the completion of the project. In June 2008, Israeli shipping magnate Sammy Ofer donated the outstanding Â£3.3 million needed to fully restore the ship although by January 2009 the London Evening Standard reported that the cost had risen further to Â£40 million creating a new shortfall.\nIn February 2010, The Daily Telegraph reported the project cost had risen to Â£46 million with public money now being made available by London Borough of Greenwich to fill the funding gap.\n\n\n==== Investigation conclusion ====\nOn 30 September 2008, the London Fire Brigade announced the conclusion of the investigation into the fire at a press conference at New Scotland Yard. The painstaking investigation was conducted by the Fire Brigade, along with London's Metropolitan Police Service, Forensic Science Services, and electrical examination experts Dr. Burgoyne's & Partners. They said that the most likely cause was the failure of an industrial vacuum cleaner that may have been left switched on over the weekend before the fire started. The report revealed no evidence that the ship was subjected to arson attack and concluded that the fire started accidentally.\nPhysical evidence and CCTV footage of the fire showed that it probably started towards the stern of the ship on the lower deck. All electrical equipment on board was examined and it was determined that an industrial vacuum cleaner in this area was normally running continuously to suck up dust and particles from work going on to break up concrete within the ship. No one working on the ship had responsibility to ensure all equipment was turned off at the end of each day, and no one recalled switching off the equipment on the Friday in question. The vacuum cleaner has three motors inside and after the fire one was found to be burned out in a manner which suggested it had failed while operating. This was not conclusive evidence, however, because the motor might previously have failed in service without causing a fire, and gone unnoticed because the other two motors had continued to function. Tests on similar cleaners showed they had no thermal cutout devices and while they could run safely indefinitely if filters inside were clear, if the airflow through the cleaner was blocked then it would eventually overheat and could catch fire. This might occur if the cleaner were full of dust and debris. The cleaner had failed previously and two motors had been replaced.\nOn the basis of witness evidence, the joint investigation team considered it unlikely that the fire was caused by the hot work (welding) that was being carried out as part of the renovation or by carelessly discarded smokers' materials. No one had visited this part of the ship since work stopped on Friday evening, and it was considered unlikely that a fire could have smouldered all weekend before finally breaking out Monday morning. However, it was discovered that although all hot work was supposed to be recorded and someone was supposed to check afterwards to ensure of no fires, there was no record that such checks had ever been made, and on at least one occasion hot work had been conducted with no records made.\nThe ship was patrolled by two security guards, both of whom were supposed to patrol independently at least once an hour, or once every two hours later in the night, one being primarily responsible for the visitor pavilion and one for the dock. The guards were required to keep a log of their patrols, but after the fire the relevant page was found to be missing from the book. It was later found, already filled in reporting uneventful patrols of the site up to 7 a.m. when the guards would have gone off duty. The alarm was raised when one of the guards called the fire brigade; before this the two reported that they had smelled burning plastic and had been investigating to try to determine its source.\nA carpenter had visited the site on Sunday to collect some tools, but after 20 minutes attempting to contact a security guard to let him in, had climbed the fence, collected his tools and climbed out again. The carpenter reported that he had heard machinery operating towards the stern of the ship, but it was not clear whether this might have been the site diesel generator which ran at all times.\nThe ship was fitted with a temporary fire alarm system but it was unclear whether this had operated. A separate alarm within the pavilion did sound when smoke and heat reached that area, but the guards reported no ringing alarm before the fire was seen. Investigation afterwards discovered a faulty relay in the alarm panel which failed to switch power to the siren circuits when an alarm was triggered. However, the panel also contained a failed fuse in one siren circuit which suggested that the siren had activated but the fire shorted it out, and this might have also caused the relay to fail. The failed relay would have shut off power to the second siren circuit. Statements from workers suggested that weekly tests of the alarm system had not been carried out.\n\n\n== Mast specifications ==\n\nThe original mast specifications as laid down by the ship's designer still exist and are listed below as \"tea rig\". This arrangement was used during the ship's time on the tea trade route, where it was necessary to maximise the area of sail to get the greatest possible propulsion when the ship might be becalmed in the doldrums. For the route to Australia it was not necessary to carry such a large area of sail and the masts and yards were reduced. The tradewinds required great strength in masts, but the wind could best be captured by relatively small, high sails. A smaller rig also represented a saving in maintenance costs. Each of the three masts (fore, main and mizzen) is in three overlapping sections.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\"Cutty Sark\"\nFalls of Clyde\nGipsy Moth IV\nList of clipper ships\nList of large sailing vessels\nList of large sailing vessels\nList of ships built by William Denny and Brothers\nStar of India\nThe Cowboy Captain of the Cutty Sark\nWilliam Pile\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nLubbock, Basil (1924).

    "wikipediaText": "Eltham Palace is a large house at Eltham ( EL-tÉm) in southeast London, England, within the Royal Borough of Greenwich. The house consists of the medieval great hall of a former royal residence, to which an Art Deco extension was added in the 1930s. The hammerbeam roof of the great hall is the third-largest of its type in England, and the Art Deco interior of the house has been described as a \"masterpiece of modern design\". The house is owned by the Crown Estate and managed by English Heritage, which took over responsibility for the great hall in 1984 and the rest of the site in 1995.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1300â1930 ===\nThe original palace was given to Edward II in 1305 by the Bishop of Durham, Anthony Bek, and used as a royal residence from the 14th to the 16th century.  According to one account, the incident which inspired Edward III's foundation of the Order of the Garter took place here.  As the favourite palace of Henry IV, it played host to Manuel II Palaiologos, the only Byzantine emperor ever to visit England, from December 1400 to mid-February 1401, with a joust being given in his honour. There is still a jousting tilt yard. The 1401 Eltham tournament was described or commemorated in literary form as thirteen letters, in old French, addressed to Henry's daughter Blanche of England. Each letter, purportedly written by a legendary patron, praises one of the combatants. Two of them, William Bardolf and John Clinton, are identified by their heraldry. The letters were probably read aloud during the event.\nEdward IV built the Great Hall in the 1470s, and the future Henry VIII grew up here; it was here in 1499 that he met and impressed the scholar Erasmus, introduced to him by Thomas More. Erasmus described the occasion:\n\nI had been carried off by Thomas More, who had come to pay me a visit on an estate of Mountjoyâs (the house of Lord Mountjoy near Greenwich) where I was staying, to take a walk by way of diversion as far as the nearest town (Eltham). For there all the royal children were being educated, Arthur alone excepted, the eldest son. When we came to the hall, all the retinue was assembled; not only that of the palace, but Mountjoyâs as well. In the midst stood Henry, aged nine, already with certain royal demeanour; I mean a dignity of mind combined with a remarkable courtesyâ¦. More with his companion Arnold saluted Henry (the present King of England) and presented to him something in writing. I, who was expecting nothing of the sort, had nothing to offer; but I promised that somehow, at some other time, I would show my duty towards him. At the time I was slightly indignant with More for having given me no warning, especially because the boy, during dinner, sent me a note inviting something from my pen. I went home, and though the Muses, from whom I had lived apart so long, were unwilling, I finished a poem in three days.\nTudor courts often used the palace for their Christmas celebrations. With the grand rebuilding of Greenwich Palace, which was more easily reached by river, Eltham was less frequented, save for the hunting in its enclosed parks, easily reached from Greenwich, \"as well enjoyed, the Court lying at Greenwiche, as if it were at this house it self\". The deer remained plentiful in the Great Park, of 596 acres (2.4 km2), the Little, or Middle Park, of 333 acres (1.3 km2), and the Home Park, or Lee Park, of 336 acres (1.4 km2).\nThe courtier Roger Aston was keeper of the little park at Eltham in 1610 and built four bridges for the convenience of James VI and I. In the 1630s, by which time the palace was no longer used by the royal family, Sir Anthony van Dyck was given the use of a suite of rooms as a country retreat. During the English Civil War, the parks were denuded of trees and deer. John Evelyn saw it 22 April 1656: \"Went to see his Majesty's house at Eltham; both the palace and chapel in miserable ruins, the noble wood and park destroyed by Rich the rebel\".  The palace never recovered. Eltham was bestowed by Charles II on John Shaw and in its ruinous conditionâ reduced to Edward IV's Great Hall, the former buttery, called \"Court House\", a bridge across the moat and some wallingâremained with Shaw's descendants as late as 1893.\nThe current house was built in the 1930s on the site of the original, and incorporates its Great Hall, which boasts the third-largest hammerbeam roof in England. Fragments of the walls of other buildings remain visible around the gardens, and the 15th-century bridge still crosses the moat.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 1930âpresent ===\nIn 1933, Stephen Courtauld and his wife Virginia \"Ginie\" Courtauld (nÃ©e Peirano) acquired a 99-year lease on the palace site and commissioned Seely & Paget to restore the hall and create a modern home attached to it. Seely and Paget added a minstrel's gallery and a timber screen to the hall, while creating a design for the main house inspired by Christopher Wren's work at Hampton Court Palace and Trinity College, Cambridge.\nThe home was decorated internally in the Art Deco style. The entrance hall was created by Swedish designer Rolf EngstrÃ¶mer; light floods in from a glazed dome, highlighting blackbean veneer and figurative marquetry. Other rooms in the house, including the dining room, drawing room and Virginia Courtauld's circular bedroom and adjoining bathroom, were the work of the Italian designer Piero Malacrida de Saint-August, while Seely and Paget designed many of the bedrooms. Keen gardeners, the Courtaulds also substantially modified and improved the grounds and gardens.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nStephen was a younger brother of Samuel Courtauld, an industrialist, art collector and founder of the Courtauld Institute of Art.  His study in the new house features a statuette version of The Sentry, copied from a Manchester war memorial, by Charles Sargeant Jagger, who was - like Stephen - a member of the Artists' Rifles during the First World War.\nThe Courtaulds' pet lemur, Mah-Jongg, had a special room on the upper floor of the house which had a hatch to the downstairs flower room; he had the run of the house. The Courtaulds remained at Eltham until 1944. During the earlier part of the war, Stephen Courtauld was a member of the local Civil Defence Service. In September 1940 he was on duty on the Great Hall roof as a fire watcher when it was badly damaged by German incendiary bombs. In 1944, the Courtauld family moved to Scotland then to Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), giving the palace to the Royal Army Educational Corps in March 1945; the corps then moved all its administration to Eltham Palace in 1948. Following the formation of the Educational and Training Services Branch of the new Adjutant General's Corps, staff moved to Worthy Down Camp in Hampshire in 1992.\nIn 1995, English Heritage assumed management of the palace, and in 1999, completed major repairs and restorations of the interiors and gardens.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Filming ==\nMany films, television programmes and music videos have been filmed at Eltham Palace, including:\n\n\n== Haunting ==\nEltham Palace is listed on English Heritage's list of \"most haunted places.\"  The ghost of a former staff member is said to have given tours of the palace when the palace should have been empty.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nEnglish Heritage - History and visitor information\nHistoric England. \"Eltham Palace (408051)\".

    "wikipediaText": "St Bartholomew's Hospital, commonly known as Barts, is a teaching hospital located in the City of London. It was founded in 1123 by Rahere, and is currently run by Barts Health NHS Trust.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBarts was founded in 1123 by Rahere (died 1144, and entombed in the nearby Priory Church of St Bartholomew the Great), a favourite courtier of King Henry I. The dissolution of the monasteries did not affect the running of Barts as a hospital, but left it in a precarious position by removing its income. It was refounded by Henry VIII in December 1546, on the signing of an agreement granting the hospital to the Corporation of London.\nThe hospital became legally styled as the \"House of the Poore in Farringdon in the suburbs of the City of London of Henry VIII's Foundation\", although the title was never used by the general public. The first superintendent of the hospital was Thomas Vicary, sergeant-surgeon to King Henry, and an early writer on anatomy. It was here that William Harvey conducted his research on the circulatory system in the 17th century, Percivall Pott and John Abernethy developed important principles of modern surgery in the 18th century, and Mrs Bedford Fenwick worked to advance the nursing profession in the late 19th century.\nFrom 1839 to 1872, the mortality reports show that surgical trauma and postoperative infection were the greatest causes of death. Tuberculosis, however, remained the most fatal nontraumatic cause of death. Nurses were expected to work 12 hours a day, and sometimes 14, with meal breaks in 1890. They had 2 weeks annual holiday. Upon the creation of the National Health Service in 1948, it officially became known as St Bartholomew's Hospital.\n\n\n=== Buildings ===\nBarts is the oldest hospital in Britain still providing medical services which occupies the site it was originally built on, and has an important current role as well as a long history and architecturally important buildings. The Henry VIII entrance to the hospital continues to be the main public entrance and features a statue of Henry VIII above the gate.\nIts main square was designed by James Gibbs in the 1730s. Of the four original blocks, three survived; they include the block containing the Great Hall and two flanking blocks that contained wards. The first wing to be built was the North Wing, in 1732, which includes the Great Hall and the canvas paintings by William Hogarth. The South Wing followed in 1740, the West in 1752 and finally the East Wing in 1769. In 1859, a fountain was placed at the square's centre with a small garden.\nSt Bartholomew's Hospital has existed on the same site since its founding in the 12th century, surviving both the Great Fire of London and the Blitz. Its museum, which is open Tuesdays to Fridays every week, shows how medical care has developed over this time and explains the history of the hospital. Part-way around the exhibition is a door which opens on to the hospital's official entrance hall. On the walls of the staircase are two canvases painted by William Hogarth, The Pool of Bethesda (1736) and The Good Samaritan (1737). They can only be seen at close quarters on Friday afternoons. Hogarth was so outraged by the news that the hospital was commissioning art from Italian painters that he insisted on painting the canvases without a fee, as a demonstration that English painting was equal to the task. The Pool of Bethesda is of particular medical interest, as it depicts a scene in which Christ cures the sick: display material on the first floor speculates in modern medical terms about the ailments from which Christ's patients in the painting are suffering. The canvases are to be restored in 2023, with a grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund.\n\nThe room to which the staircase leads is the hospital's Great Hall, a double-height room in Baroque style. Although there are a few paintings inside the Great Hall, nearly all are on movable stands: the walls themselves are mostly given over to the display of the very many large, painted plaques which list, in detail, the sums of money given to the hospital by its benefactors.\nAfter the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the hospital precincts of the ancient priory were redesignated as an Anglican ecclesiastical parish, with St Bartholomew-the-Less becoming the parish church â a unique situation amongst English hospital foundations. St Barts-the-Less is the only survivor of five chapels originally within the hospital's estate, the others failing to survive the Reformation.  The church has a 15th-century tower and vestry, and its connections with the hospital can be seen not only in its early-20th century stained glass window of a nurse, a gift from the Worshipful Company of Glaziers, but also in commemorative plaques adorning its interior.\nThroughout the whole of the 19th century, the Hardwick family were major benefactors of the hospital. Thomas Hardwick Jr. (1752â1825), Philip Hardwick (1792â1870), and Philip Charles Hardwick (1822â1892) were all architects/surveyors to Barts Hospital. Philip Hardwick, a Royal Academician, was also engaged in the rebuilding of the Church of St Bartholomew-the-Less in 1823 and donated the fountain in the hospital's courtyard.\nBy 1872, Barts contained 676 beds. About 6,000 in-patients were admitted every year, as well as 101,000 out-patients. The average income of the hospital was Â£40,000 (derived chiefly from rents and funded property) and the number of governors exceeded 300.\n\n\n=== Threatened closure ===\n\nIn 1993 the controversial Tomlinson Review of London hospitals was published and concluded that there were too many hospitals in central London. It recommended that the service should be delivered closer to where people lived. Barts was identified as a hospital with a catchment area that had a low population and the hospital was threatened with closure. A determined campaign was mounted to save the hospital by the Save Barts Campaign, supported by staff, residents, local MPs and the City of London Corporation.\nSome facilities were saved, but the accident and emergency department closed in 1995, with facilities relocated to the Royal London Hospital (a hospital in the same trust group, but a couple of miles away in Whitechapel). A minor injuries unit was established at Barts for small cases (which often represent a significant part of the workload of A&E services) but urgent and major work goes to other hospitals.\n\n\n=== Redevelopment ===\n\nA plan was formulated for Barts to develop as a centre of excellence in cardiac care and cancer. The plan came under threat when it was announced that the works would be procured under a private finance initiative contract; the Save Barts campaign continued to protest. The opposition subsided and a new Barts Heart Centre and new cancer care facilities were created. The Queen Mary Wing was demolished and the faÃ§ade of the George V building was retained within a new hospital building. A new main entrance was established on King Edward Street. The three James Gibbs blocks were refurbished and car parking was removed from the area. The works, which were designed by HOK and undertaken by Skanska at a cost of circa Â£500 million, were completed in early 2016.\nBarts continues to be associated with excellence at its medical school's significant research and teaching facilities on the Charterhouse Square site. Barts, along with the Royal London Hospital and London Chest Hospital, was part of Barts and The London NHS Trust. There are 388 beds in Barts and 675 beds in the Royal London. These hospitals amalgamated with Whipps Cross and Newham hospitals on 1 March 2012 to form the Barts Health NHS Trust.\n\n\n=== Nuffield Health ===\nIn 2018, Nuffield Health, a not-for-profit healthcare organisation, was granted planning permission to redevelop the former pathology and residential staff quarters building into a new private hospital. It is the only private hospital in the City of London, and has 48 beds and 4 operating theatres. It opened in 2022, at a cost of Â£60 million. It is physically and operationally separate from the rest of the hospital, and known as Nuffield Health at St Bartholomew's Hospital.\n\n\n== Teaching ==\n\nIn 1843, St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College was established to train medics although considered to have been started by John Abernethy when the hospital built a theatre for his lectures at the beginning of the century. In 1995 the college, along with that attached to the Royal London, merged into Queen Mary University of London, but maintains a distinctive identity. It is now known as Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry. It occupies some space at the Barts site in Farringdon, with a presence a short walk away at Charterhouse Square.  The main preclinical teaching domain of the medical school is at Whitechapel in the award-winning Blizard Building.\nThe present School of Nursing and Midwifery was formed in 1994 from merging the Schools from St Bartholomew's Hospital and the Royal London Hospital to become the St Bartholomew School of Nursing & Midwifery. In 1995 the new School was incorporated into the City University. Both Schools have a strong and respected history dating back over 120 years and have produced many nurse leaders and educators. The School has since been incorporated into the School of Health Sciences, City University London.\n\n\n== Notable staff ==\nEthel Gordon Fenwick, Matron 1881â1887\nIsla Stewart, Matron 1887â1910\nRachel Annie Cox Davies CBE, night sister, home sister and sister of Faith Ward (1896-9);  first secretary of the League of St. Bartholomew's Nurses and founding member of the Royal College of Nursing\nMary Harfield 1879â1970, nurse and archaeologist\nAnnie Sophia Jane McIntosh, Matron 1910â1927, trained between 1897 and 1899 at The London Hospital under Matron Eva Luckes. McIntosh then worked as a Sister in Matron's office, and as an Assistant Matron between 1899 and 1910. During the First World War she was a member of the War Office Committee for the Supply of Nurses and Principal Matron, 1st London General Hospital in Camberwell.\nPamela Hibbs CBE OBE FRCN DScHon 1935â2021 qualified at St. Bartholomew's in 1958 gaining the finalist gold medal. Hibbs held varied posts and in 1976 was seconded to improve the failing Hackney Hospital.  In 1978 she had a key role in planning for the new Homerton Hospital.  In 1994 on the merger of Barts and the Royal London Hibbs was appointed as Chief Nurse across the Royal Hospitals Trust, she retired in 1997.\n\n\n== Hospital museums ==\nSt Bartholomew's Hospital museum tells the historical narrative of the hospital and its work in caring for the sick and injured. The museum collections include historic surgical instruments, sculptures, medieval archives, and works of art, including paintings by William Hogarth.  The museum is located under the North Wing archway. It closed in September 2023 for renovation works, expected to last through 2024. The collections are searchable on the Barts Health NHS Trust online catalogue, which contains information on over 50,000 entries and covering an 800-year span.\nAlso on the site is the Barts Pathology Museum, which has over 4,000 medical specimens on display and has been described by CNN as one of the \"world's 10 weirdest medical museums\". This museum is only open by appointment and for special events. Both museums are part of the London Museums of Health & Medicine group.\n\n\n== Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson ==\nA chemical laboratory at Barts was the location of the initial meeting of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in Arthur Conan Doyle's 1887 novel A Study in Scarlet. Barts was Watson's alma mater. This fictional connection led to a donation by the Tokyo \"Sherlock Holmes Appreciation Society\" to the Save Barts Campaign in the 1990s.\nIn 2012, the final episode of the second series of the BBC drama Sherlock, \"The Reichenbach Fall\", had Holmes appearing to have deliberately leapt to his death from the roof of St Bartholomew's as a surrogate for the waterfall of the original story \"The Final Problem\". The hospital was again used as the location for the resolution to Holmes' faked suicide, in the first series three episode \"The Empty Hearse\".\n\n\n== Transport ==\nLondon Buses routes 4, 8, 17, 25, 45, 46, 56, 59, 63, 76, 100, 153, 172, 242, N8, N63 and N76 serve the hospital, with bus stops located outside or near the hospital. The nearest Underground stations are Barbican and Farringdon on the Circle, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines and St Paul's on the Central line. Farringdon is also served by Thameslink trains.\n\n\n== Patient entertainment ==\nSince 2022 Bedrock Radio (a registered charity) broadcasts to St Bartholomew's Hospital and wider Barts Health Trust. Bedrock replaced Whipps Cross Hospital Radio (WXHR) who formally served the Trust from 1969 to 2022.\n\n\n== Arms ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDainton, Courtney. \"Bart's Hospital\", History Today (1978) 28#12 pp810â16, popular overview; online\nRobinson, James O (1993). \"The Royal and Ancient Hospital of St Bartholomew (Founded 1123)\".

Square plan.  EXTERIOR: Portland stone tower in three stages with oculus at second stage and rectangular belfry apertures at the third stage, this capped with a cornice, a lacy Baroque pierced parapet and corner pinnacles of Baroque obelisks.  Rising behind this is the lead spire, restored in 1967 to Hawksmoor's original design, and featuring curved brackets rising to an open stage with urns and the distinctive elongated onion dome.  To the south is a pedimented door, and to the east, exposed rubble walling and quoins at lower stage.  Attached to the north is the Grade II* St Paul's Cathedral Choir School (q.v.) of 1962-7 by the Architects' Co-partnership.INTERIOR: Stages of the tower include a full height open well stair cases that serves as a fire escape for the attached school.  Ladder stair into spire not inspected.  HISTORY:  The church had been rebuilt 1680-4 following the Great Fire of 1666, and the tower was completed in 1695-6 with a tall leaded spire that was modified in 1830.  However, the body and spire were destroyed in 1941 bombing and a 1953 photograph shows all that remained standing were the bottom two stages of the tower with its four Baroque obelisk finials.  In 1966, the spire was reconstructed according to its original design by Paul Paget of Seely and Paget.  Drawings survive in the hand of Nicholas Hawksmoor to show that he designed the original spire, with its brackets rising to an open stage with urns and the distinctive elongated onion dome.  His drawing c.1695, however, shows the onion dome as an elongated pineapple with the crown serving as an extra finial.  This design, but with the onion, not the pineapple, is largely what we see today, although it is an immaculate post-war reconstruction. The adjacent school was built in 1962-67 and the brief dictated that the new building should incorporate the restored spire of St Augustine and that no part of the school would be higher than its cornice.SOURCES: \nSimon Bradley and Nikolaus Pevsner.  The Buildings of England.  London: The City Churches.  Yale University Press, 1998.  p.61.  SUMMARY OF IMPORTANCE: A 1695-6 Wren tower with post-war restored Hawksmoor spire that forms an ensemble of outstanding special interest.  It is one the more admired City church spires with its spire culminating in the distinctive elongated onion dome.  It has particularly strong group value being the closest of the City Churches to Wren's Cathedral. Although the most characteristic feature is post-war in date, and the church body is now lost, it remains a special landmark tower, both for its original design and for its strong relationship with St Paul's.

    "wikipediaText": "St Augustine, Watling Street, was an Anglican church which stood just to the east of St Paul's Cathedral in the City of London.  First recorded in the 12th century, it was destroyed by the Great Fire of London in 1666 and rebuilt to the designs of Christopher Wren. This building was destroyed by bombing during the Second World War, and its remains now form part of St Paul's Cathedral Choir School.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Medieval church ===\nThe church stood on the north side of Watling Street, at the corner with Old Change. According to Richard Newcourt, the dedication was to St Augustine of Canterbury, rather than St Augustine of Hippo. The earliest recorded mentioned of the church is from 1148. In 1252â3 Alexander le Cordwaner made a grant of land on the north side for its enlargement. John Stow, writing at the end of the 16th century called St Augustine's \" a fair church,\" adding that it had been \"lately well repaired.\" The church was partly rebuilt, and \"in every part of it richly and very worthily beautified\" in 1630â1, at a cost to the parishioners of  Â£1,200. The foundations of the northern half of the medieval church were revealed when burials were removed in 1965. The archaeological evidence indicated that the 12th-century church was about 61 feet (19 m) long, the thirteenth century extension 59 feet (18 m) long and 16 feet (4.9 m) wide.\nThe medieval building was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666.\n\n\n== Rebuilding after the fire ==\nAfter the fire the parish was united with that of St Faith's, whose congregation had previously worshipped in the crypt of St Paul's Cathedral. St Augustine's was rebuilt to a design by Christopher Wren; the foundations, revealed by the excavations of 1965, were mostly of re-used stones set in mortar. The new church opened in September, 1683, but the steeple was not finished until 1695.\nThe interior was about 51 feet (16 m) long â shorter than the medieval building â 45 feet (14 m) wide and 30 feet (9.1 m) high. The nave was divided from the aisles by an arcade supported on Corinthian columns with unusually high bases. The naves and aisles were barrel vaulted, the nave vault being pierced by three skylights on each side. There were galleries on the north side, and at the west end, but the latter was taken down when the organ was moved to the south side. The walls were originally panelled to a height of 8 feet (2.4 m), but this was later considerably reduced. The reredos had Corinthian columns and the pulpit was of carved oak. The pulpit was modernised by Arthur Blomfield in 1878.\nRectors of the church included John Douglas, later Bishop of Carlisle and of Salisbury, from 1764 to 1787, and Richard Harris Barham, author of the Ingoldsby Legends, from 1842 until his death in 1845.\n\n\n== Destruction ==\nThe church was destroyed by bombing in 1941. It was not rebuilt, but the tower was restored in 1954 and later incorporated into a new choir school for St Paul's Cathedral, completed in 1967.\nThe remains of the church were designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.\n\n\n== Faith, the church cat ==\nThe church cat, named Faith, became quite well known after the air raid which destroyed St Augustine's in the Second World War. \nIn 1936 Faith, a stray cat, turned up at St Augustine's church. Although being turned out three times by Father Henry Ross, eventually Faith was allowed to stay. Nobody claimed her so she stayed, attending Sunday services and hunting mice.\nDays before the bomb attack on the church she was seen moving her black and white kitten, Panda, to the cellar. Despite being brought back several times, Faith insisted on returning Panda to her refuge. \nOn the morning after the air raid the rector searched through the dangerous ruins for the missing animals, and eventually found Faith, surrounded by smouldering rubble and debris but still guarding the kitten in the spot she had selected three days earlier. The story of her premonition and rescue eventually reached Maria Dickin, founder of the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals, and for her courage and devotion Faith was awarded a specially-made silver medal. Her death in 1948 was reported on four continents.\nFaith is buried in the churchyard of St Paul's Choir School. A stone marker stands over its grave with the words, \"Faith the cat who defied the London Blitz\".\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of Christopher Wren churches in London\nList of churches rebuilt after the Great Fire but since demolished\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFaith the Church Cat\nSt Paulâs Cathedral School"

    "wikipediaText": "St Mary Aldermary  (or St Mary Elder Mary) is an Anglican church located on Bow Lane at the junction with Watling Street, in the City of London within the United Kingdom.\nOf medieval origin, rebuilding began in 1510 and was not finished until 1632. Severely damaged just 33 years later during the Great Fire of London in 1666, it was rebuilt once more by the office of Sir Christopher Wren. Unlike most of Wren's City churches, St Mary Aldermary was reconstructed in the Gothic Revival style. In 1952 its role was changed from a parish church to that of a guild church, intended to serve commuters and non-resident workers within the City of London. The main church space acts a public cafe during weekday business hours, with religious and meditative sessions held during mornings and evenings.\n\n\n== History ==\nA church has occupied the site for more than 900 years. Its name is usually taken to mean that it is the oldest of the City churches dedicated to the Virgin Mary. It has also been suggested that, on Bow Lane, it is the older St Maryâs with respect to nearby St Mary Le Bow. The patronage of the rectory of St Mary Aldermary belonged to the prior and chapter of Canterbury, but was transferred to the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1400.\n\nIn 1510, Sir Henry Keeble financed the building of a new church. The tower was still unfinished when he died in 1518.  In 1629, two legacies enabled it to be completed, and the work, begun 120 years before, was finished within three years. Keble was buried in a vault beneath the floor of the church, but his grave was not allowed to remain for long. Richard Newcourt recorded that Sir William Laxton, who died in 1556, and Sir Tho. Lodge, who died in 1583 (both which were Grocers and had been Mayors of this City), were buried in the Vault of this Sir Henry Keeble, his bones unkindly cast out, and his Monument pull'd down, in place whereof, Monuments were set up of the others.\nJohn Stow mentions various dignitaries buried in the early church in his 1598 Survey of London. They include Richard Chaucer, vintner, said by Stow to be the father of the poet Geoffrey Chaucer. John Milton married his third wife, Elizabeth Minshull, in the church in 1663 (Curiously, he seems to have married his second at St Mary Aldermanbury). The parish registers date from 1558, and are now deposited in the Guildhall Library.\nIn 1599 a group of citizens from St. Antholin's founded a lectureship. They gave property in London to pay for a daily lecture in the pulpit at St. Antholinâs and the church became famous as a lecture theatre. The Great Fire burned down the church but daily lectures carried on; it was rebuilt but was demolished in 1870 and the lecture was transferred to St. Mary Aldermary. The lectures are now organised by the Church Society.\n\n\n=== Rebuilding after the Great Fire ===\nSt Mary Aldermary was badly damaged in the Great Fire of London of 1666, although parts of its walls and tower survived.  It was mostly rebuilt by the office of Sir Christopher Wren in a Gothic style. A legacy of Â£5,000 had been left by one Henry Rogers for the rebuilding of a church, and his widow agreed to use it to fund the reconstruction of St Mary's. According to some sources, she stipulated that the new church should be an exact imitation of the one largely destroyed.\nThe church, as rebuilt, has an aisled nave, six bays long, with a clerestory. It has a short chancel. The tower is attached to the south-west corner of the building, and is entered through a western lobby. The tower is divided into storeys by string courses; the corners lead up to octagonal turrets, terminating in what George Godwin called \"carved finials of impure design\". The churchâs nave and aisles are separated by arcades of clustered columns, supporting somewhat flattened Gothic arches. The ceilings are decorated with elaborate plaster fan vaulting.\nAccording to Nikolaus Pevsner, St Mary Aldemary is \"the chief surviving monument of the 17th-century Gothic revival in the City and â with Warwick â the most important late 17th-century Gothic church in England\".\nThe parish of the church of St Thomas the Apostle, destroyed in the Great Fire and not rebuilt, was united with that of St Mary's.\nIn 1781 a new organ was installed, built by George England.\n\n\n=== Wartime damage ===\nSt Mary Aldermary was damaged by German bombs in the London Blitz during the Second World War.\n\n\n=== Restorations ===\n\nThe church has been repaired and restored many times. In 1876â7 major changes were made to the interior: an oak screen was inserted, dividing the lobby from the church; the pews and stalls were replaced, the organ was moved from the western gallery to the chancel; the floor was repaved, new stained glass put into the windows, and a new reredos installed.\nThe church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.\nThe latest interior restoration was finished in April 2005, with attention paid to the plaster ceilings and memorials on the north wall. A service was held, presided over by Richard Chartres, the Bishop of London, to celebrate completion, on 21 April 2005.\n\n\n== Burials ==\nCharles Blount, 5th Baron Mountjoy\n\n\n== Recent activities ==\nIn January 2010, the Bishop and Archdeacon of London invited the Moot Community to make their home in St Mary Aldermary. Moot was a Church of England community set up in the spirit of the Fresh Expressions initiative of that decade. Members committed to living a \"rhythm of life\", encompassing spiritual practices such as prayer, meditation and presence, and values such as acceptance, balance, creativity and hospitality. \nAs of 2023, services in the same tradition are held at 8am on Monday (silent meditation), Wednesday (Taize) and Friday (Taize) mornings, and at 6pm (Still Point contemplation) on Wednesdays.\nIn 2012 Moot set up a cafÃ©, Host, which continues to sell fair trade coffee and goods.\nSince 2007, the church has been the Regimental Church of the Royal Tank Regiment.\nThe church also hosts the Moldovan Orthodox church in London, which designates the building by the name of St Nicholas. \nPreviously, SMA hosted the Malankara Orthodox Syrian congregation as their church of St Gregorios, which combined Keralan styles of south Indian worship with ancient Syriac in the tradition of St Thomas the Apostle, missionary to India.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of churches and cathedrals of London\nList of Christopher Wren churches in London\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nDaniell, A.E.

    "wikipediaText": "St Nicholas Cole Abbey is a church in the City of London located on what is now Queen Victoria Street. Recorded from the twelfth century, the church was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666 and rebuilt by the office of Sir Christopher Wren. The church suffered substantial bomb damage from German bombs during the London Blitz in the Second World War and was reconstructed by Arthur Bailey in 1961â62.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe church is dedicated to the 4th century Saint Nicholas of Myra. The name \"Cole Abbey\" is derived from \"coldharbour\", a medieval word for a traveller's shelter or shelter from the cold. The church was never an abbey. The earliest reference to the church is in a letter of Pope Lucius II in 1144â5.\n\nSaint Nicholas of Myra is patron saint of, among other groups, children and fishermen, and the church has special ties with both. An inventory of the church's possessions taken at the time of the Protestant Reformation includes vestments for children, suggesting that the church maintained the tradition of electing a boy bishop on Saint Nicholas Day. Deeds in the reign of Richard I refer to a new fish market near St Nicholas Cole Abbey. In a Charter of 1272, the church is referred to as \"St Nick's behind Fish Street\".  During the 16th century, several fishmongers were buried here and John Stow records that, during the reign of Elizabeth I, a lead and stone cistern, fed by the Thames, was set up against the north wall \"for the care and commodity of the Fishmongers in and about Old Fish Street\".\nLike all English churches, St Nicholas Cole Abbey became Protestant during the Reformation. Upon the accession of Queen Mary I, it was the first church to celebrate Mass (on 23 August 1553). The incumbent rector, Thomas Sowdley, had obtained a licence to marry during the reign of Edward VI and was deprived of his living as a result. In the same month as the coronation of Mary I, John Strype recorded \"Another priest called sir Tho. Snowdel, [i.e. Sowdley] whom they nicknamed 'Parson Chicken', was carted through Cheapside, for assoiling an old acquaintance of his in a ditch in Finsbury field; and was at that riding saluted with chamber-pots and rotten eggs\". Sowdley regained his living on the accession of Elizabeth I.\nA century later, the living of St Nicholas Cole Abbey was owned by Colonel Francis Hacker, a Puritan who commanded the execution detail of Charles I.\nThe church was destroyed in the Great Fire. Charles II promised the site to the Lutheran community but lobbying prevented this from being granted and the parish was combined with that of St Nicholas Olave, a nearby church also destroyed but not rebuilt. The church was rebuilt between 1672 and 1678 at a cost of Â£5042. Included in the building accounts are the items \"Dinner for Dr Wren and other Company â Â£2 14s 0d\" and \"Half a pint of canary for Dr Wren's coachmen â 6d\". It was the first church of the fifty-one lost in the Great Fire to be rebuilt.\nIn 1737, the early Methodist leader George Whitefield preached a sermon on \"Profane swearing in church\" at St Nicholas Cole Abbey.\nThe post-Fire church was built with its faÃ§ade to the north on what was then Fish Street (and what is now Distaff Lane) and the east on Old Fish Street Hill. Victorian urban redevelopment changed the local street plan and the south wall of the church, instead of being hemmed in by buildings, now overlooked the newly built Queen Victoria Street. This necessitated a reordering of the church, in 1874, with windows being opened up to the south and the main doorway moving from the northwest tower to the south.\nSmoke generated by underground trains so blackened the exterior that in the late 19th century, the church became known as \"St Nicholas Cole Hole Abbey\".\nIn May 1881, church attendance under the Reverend Henry Stebbing was down to one man and one woman. Then, in 1883, Henry Shuttleworth was appointed rector, a position he held until 1900. Shuttleworth was a Christian Socialist who installed a bar, established a prodigious musical programme and made the church a centre for debate. This had an effect, as by 1891 St Nicholas Cole Abbey had the largest congregation of any City church, numbering up to 450 worshippers on a Sunday evening. A contemporary vicar commented: \"In St. Nicholas Cole Abbey there is good preaching and divine worship is also carried out in the most reverential manner. In other City churches ... as a rule, they [the rectors] are themselves the most wretched preachers and bad readers.\"\nOn 10 May 1941 London suffered its worst air raid during the entire Second World War, with 1,436 people killed and several major buildings destroyed or severely damaged. Among them was St Nicholas Cole Abbey. The church remained a shell until restored under Arthur Bailey and reconsecrated in 1962.\n\n\n=== Recent history ===\nThe parish was combined with that of St Andrew-by-the-Wardrobe. St Nicholas Cole Abbey became the headquarters of the Diocesan Council for Mission and Unity. Between 1982 and 2003, the church was leased to the Free Church of Scotland (Presbyterian).\nIn 2006, the Church of England announced that St Nicholas Cole Abbey would become a national centre for Religious Education: the Culham Institute, a Church of England educational body which promotes and develops RE in schools, would move its headquarters to St Nicholas Cole Abbey from Oxford. This did not come to pass.\nIn 2014 the building reopened as the home of the St Nicholas Cole Abbey Centre for Workplace Ministry, with a supporting cafe known as The Wren.\n\n\n=== Present day ===\nIn November 2016, Sunday services re-started, alongside midweek meetings, under the name St Nick's Church.\nThe parish is within the conservative evangelical tradition of the Church of England, and it has passed resolutions to reject the ordination of women and/or female leadership.\nIn November 2022, St. Nicholas announced that it was making a \"visible differentiation\" from the Church of England's House of Bishops, in protest at the bishops' engagement with the Living in Love and Faith process which considered the possibility of blessing same-sex sexual relationships. In March 2023, after the church's General Synod approved the principle of blessings for same-sex couples, the Senior Minister of St Nicholas, along with the guild vicar of St Botolph's, Aldersgate, announced they had established a new \"deanery chapter\", separate from the official diocesan structures, for clergy who felt \"compelled to resist all episcopal leadership from the House of Bishops\". This move was described by the Diocese of London as a \"unilateral move\" with \"no legal substance\", and by the Church Times as \"schismatic\".\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.\n\n\n=== Exterior ===\n\nThe church is a stone box with quoins. Some medieval work remains in the south and west walls, the latter of which is of brick and rubble.  On top of the body of the church is a balustrade. The windows are arched with square brackets â a favourite device of Wren.\nOn the northwestern corner of the church is a square tower surmounted by a lead spire in the shape of an upside down octagonal trumpet. On each corner of the tower is a small flaming urn. The spire has two rows of lunettes and a small balcony near the top, resembling a crow's nest. At the very top is a vane in the shape of a three-masted barque in the round. This came from St Michael Queenhithe (demolished 1876), and was added to the spire in 1962. The pre-War vane was in the shape of a pennant with 4 \"S\" shapes back to back.\nThe tower is 135 feet tall and contains one bell.\n\n\n=== Interior ===\nThe east wall is dominated by three stained glass windows designed by Keith New, who also helped design the stained glass windows of Coventry Cathedral. They are reminiscent of the work of Marc Chagall. They replace windows designed by Edward Burne-Jones which were destroyed in 1941. From left to right they depict St Nicholas Cole Abbey as the centre of the world with crosses pointing to the four corners of the world; the Rock of Christ with the ark (representing the church) on four rivers (representing the Gospels); seven lamps, representing the extension of the church around the world.\nSwags have been recreated over the east windows. The interior is otherwise plain, other than Corinthian pilasters. In the vestry to the north west is crazy paving made from shattered tombstones.\n\nSurviving from the 17th century are the carved pulpit, (although on a modern base and lacking its tester), the font cover, part of the communion rail, parts of the original Wren era reredos, now installed on the south wall and the Charles II coat of arms.\nBehind a panel near the south door is a medieval stone head found during the restoration.\nThe organ was built by Noel Mander for the restored church.\nIn 2006, as part of a planned redevelopment of the church as a centre for Religious Education, it was announced that a free-standing glass box would be built inside the shell of the church. This redevelopment did not come to pass.\n\n\n== Services and other activities ==\nSt Nick's Church meets each Sunday at 11am. Services are contemporary in style and there are Sunday clubs and a crÃ¨che for youth and children. Before the service, coffee and pastries are served from 10.30 and there is an informal lunch afterwards.\nSmall groups are held on Wednesday evenings, at 6.15pm for a meal and 7pm for bible study and prayer. St Nick's Talks run every Thursday lunchtime at 1.05pm. The aim of the talks is to explain, from the Bible, the good news of Jesus Christ to those working nearby.\n\n\n== St Nicholas Cole Abbey in culture ==\nHenry Shuttleworth is the model for James Morrell, the Socialist preacher in George Bernard Shaw's 1898 play Candida.\nThe gutted shell of St Nicholas Cole Abbey is the scene of the gold bullion heist in the 1951 Ealing comedy The Lavender Hill Mob.\nThe church features in Iris Murdoch's first novel Under the Net, published in 1954.\nSt Nicholas Cole Abbey was used as a location in 1968 Doctor Who serial The Invasion.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of churches and cathedrals of London\nList of Christopher Wren churches in London\n\n\n== References ==\n\nBradley, Simon & Pevsner, Nikolaus.

    "wikipediaText": "The College of Arms, or Heralds' College, is a royal corporation consisting of professional officers of arms, with jurisdiction over England, Wales, Northern Ireland and some Commonwealth realms. The heralds are appointed by the British Sovereign and are delegated authority to act on behalf of the Crown in all matters of heraldry, the granting of new coats of arms, genealogical research and the recording of pedigrees. The College is also the official body responsible for matters relating to the flying of flags on land, and it maintains the official registers of flags and other national symbols. Though a part of the Royal Household of the United Kingdom, the College is self-financed, unsupported by any public funds.\nFounded by royal charter in 1484 by King Richard III of England, the College is one of the few remaining official heraldic authorities in Europe. Within the United Kingdom, there are two such authorities, the Court of the Lord Lyon in Scotland and the College of Arms for the rest of the United Kingdom. The College has had its home in the City of London since its foundation, and has been at its present location, on Queen Victoria Street, since 1555. The College of Arms also undertakes and consults on the planning of many ceremonial occasions such as coronations, state funerals, the annual Garter Service and the State Opening of Parliament. Heralds of the College accompany the sovereign on many of these occasions.\nThe College comprises thirteen officers or heralds: three Kings of Arms, six Heralds of Arms and four Pursuivants of Arms. There are also seven officers extraordinary, who take part in ceremonial occasions but are not part of the College. The entire corporation is overseen by the Earl Marshal, a hereditary office always held by the Duke of Norfolk.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\n\nKing Richard III's interest in heraldry was indicated by his possession of two important rolls of arms. While still Duke of Gloucester and Constable of England for his brother (Edward IV) from 1469, he in the latter capacity supervised the heralds and made plans for the reform of their organisation. Soon after his accession to the throne he created Sir John Howard as Duke of Norfolk and Earl Marshal of England, who became the first Howard appointed to both positions.\nIn the first year of his reign, the royal heralds were incorporated under royal charter dated 2 March 1484, under the Latin name \"Le Garter regis armorum Anglicorum, regis armorum partium Australium, regis armorum partium Borealium, regis armorum WallÃ¦ et heraldorum, prosecutorum, sive pursevandorum armorum.\" Translated as: \"the Garter King of Arms of England, the King of Arms of the Southern parts, the King of Arms of the Northern parts, the King of Arms of Wales, and all other heralds and pursuivants of arms\". The charter then goes on to state that the heralds \"for the time being, shall be in perpetuity a body corporate in fact and name, and shall preserve a succession unbroken.\" This charter titled \"LiterÃ¦ de incorporatione heraldorum\" is now held in the British Museum.\nThere has been some evidence that prior to this charter, the royal heralds had already in some ways behaved like a corporation as early as 1420. Nevertheless, the charter is the earliest surviving document to affirm the chapter as a corporate body of heralds. The charter outlines the constitution of the officers, their hierarchy, the privileges conferred upon them and their jurisdiction over all heraldic matters in the Kingdom of England.\nThe King empowered the College to have and use only one common seal of authority, and also instructed them to find a chaplain to celebrate mass daily for himself, Anne Neville, the Queen Consort, and his heir, Prince Edward. The College was also granted a house named Coldharbour (formerly Poulteney's Inn) on Upper Thames Street in the parish of All-Hallows-the-Less, for storing records and living space for the heralds. The house, built by Sir John de Pulteney, four times Lord Mayor of London, was said to be one of the greatest in the City of London.\n\n\n=== Varying fortunes ===\n\nThe defeat and death of Richard III at Bosworth field was a double blow for the heralds, for they lost both their patron, the King, and their benefactor, the Earl Marshal, who was also slain. The victorious Henry Tudor was crowned King Henry VII soon after the battle. Henry's first Parliament of 1485 passed an Act of Resumption, in which large grants of crown properties made by his two predecessors to their supporters were cancelled. Whether this act affected the status of the College's charter is debatable; however, the act did facilitate the de facto recovery of Coldharbour to the crown. Henry then granted the house to his mother Lady Margaret Beaufort, for life. This was because it was supposed that the house was granted personally to John Writhe the Garter King of Arms and not to the heralds as a corporation. As a result, the heralds were left destitute and many of their books and records were lost. Despite this ill treatment from the King, the heralds' position at the royal court remained, and they were compelled by the King to attend him at all times (albeit in rotation).\nOf the reign of King Henry VIII, it has been said that: \"at no time since its establishment, was [the college] in higher estimation, nor in fuller employment, than in this reign.\" Henry VIII was fond of pomp and magnificence, and thus gave the heralds plenty of opportunity to exercise their roles in his court. In addition, the members of the College were also expected to be regularly despatched to foreign courts on missions, whether to declare war, accompany armies, summon garrisons or deliver messages to foreign potentates and generals. During his magnificent meeting with Francis I of France at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520, Henry VIII brought with him eighteen officers of arms, probably all he had, to regulate the many tournaments and ceremonies held there.\n\nNevertheless, the College's petitions to the King and to the Duke of Suffolk in 1524 and 1533 for the return of their chapter house were rejected, and the heralds were left to hold chapter in whichever palace the royal court happened to be at the time. They even resorted to meeting at each other's houses, at various guildhalls and even a hospital. Furthermore, Henry VIII's habit of raising ladies in the situation of subjects to queens, and then awarding them many heraldic augmentations, which also extended to their respective families, was considered harmful to the science of heraldry. The noted antiquarian and heraldist Charles Boutell commented in 1863, that the: \"Arms of Queen Anne Boleyn are the first which exemplify the usage, introduced by Henry VIII, of granting to his Consorts 'Augmentations' to their paternal arms. It is a striking illustration of the degenerate condition of Heraldry under the second Tudor Sovereign.\"\nIt was also in this reign in 1530, that Henry VIII conferred on the College one of its most important duties for almost a century, the heraldic visitation. The provincial Kings of Arms were commissioned under a royal warrant to enter all houses and churches and given authority to deface and destroy all arms unlawfully used by any knight, esquire, or gentleman. Around the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries this duty became even more necessary as the monasteries were previously repositories of local genealogical records. From then on, all genealogical records and the duty of recording them was subsumed by the College. These visitations were serious affairs, and many individuals were charged and heavily fined for breaking the law of arms. Hundreds of these visitations were carried out well into the 17th century; the last was in 1686.\n\n\n=== Reincorporation ===\n\nThe College found a patroness in Mary I, although it must have been embarrassing for both sides, after the heralds initially proclaimed the right of her rival Lady Jane Grey to the throne. When King Edward VI died on 6 July 1553, Lady Jane Grey was proclaimed queen four days later, first in Cheapside then in Fleet Street by two heralds, trumpets blowing before them. However, when popular support swung to Mary's side, the Lord Mayor of London and his councils accompanied by the Garter King of Arms, two other heralds, and four trumpeters returned to Cheapside to proclaim Mary's ascension as rightful queen instead. The College's excuse was that they had been compelled in their earlier act by the Duke of Northumberland (Lady Jane's father-in-law, who was later executed), an excuse that Mary accepted.\nThe queen and her husband (and co-sovereign) Philip II of Spain then set about granting the College a new house called Derby Place or Derby House, under a new charter, dated 18 July 1555 at Hampton Court Palace. The house was built by Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby, who married Lady Margaret Beaufort in 1482 and was created the 1st Earl of Derby in 1485. The house was built in 1503 and was given to the Crown by the 3rd Earl in 1552/3 in exchange for some land. The charter stated that the house would: \"enable them [the College] to assemble together, and consult, and agree amongst themselves, for the good of their faculty, and that the records and rolls might be more safely and conveniently deposited.\" The charter also reincorporated the three kings of arms, six heralds and all other heralds and pursuivants, and their successors, into a corporation with perpetual succession. A new seal of authority, with the College's full coat of arms was also engraved. On 16 May 1565, the name \"the House of the Office of Arms\" was used, thereafter in May 1566 \"our Colledge of Armes\", and in January 1567 \"our House of the College of the office of arms\".\nDerby Place was situated in the parish of St Benedict and St Peter, south of St Paul's Cathedral, more or less on the College's present location. There are records of the heralds carrying out modifications to the structure of Derby Place over many years. However, little record of its appearance has survived, except the description that the buildings formed three sides of a quadrangle, entered through a gate with a portcullis on the west side. On the south range, roughly where Queen Victoria Street now stands, was a large hall on the western end. Derby Place's hearth tax bill from 1663, discovered in 2009 at the National Archives at Kew, showed that the building had about thirty-two rooms, which were the workplace as well as the home to eleven officers of arms.\n\nThe reign of Mary's sister Elizabeth I saw the college's privileges confirmed by an act of Parliament in 1566. As well as the drawing up of many important internal statutes and ordinances for the College by Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, the Earl Marshal, dated 18 July 1568. The long reign saw the College distracted by the many quarrels between Garter William Dethick, Clarenceux Robert Cooke and York Herald Ralph Brooke about their rights and annulments. Disputes in which the other officers also took part, often occurred among the lesser heralds against each other. Historian Mark Noble wrote in 1805, that these fights often involved the use of \"every epithet that was disgraceful to themselves and their opponents.\"  and that \"Their accusations against each other would fill a volume.\" During these years, the College's reputation was greatly injured in the eyes of the public.\nThe reason behind these discords were laid on the imperfect execution of the reorganisation of the College in 1568 and the uncertainty over issue of granting arms to the new and emerging gentry of the era. An enquiry into the state of the College lasted for one year, finally reporting to William Cecil, Baron Burghley in 1596; as a consequence, many important measures of reform for the College were made in the reign of James I. Eventually, these animosities among the heralds in the College ended only after the expulsion of one and the death of another.\n\n\n=== Civil War ===\nWhen the English Civil War began in 1642 during the reign of King Charles I, the College was divided: three kings of arms, three heralds and one pursuivant sided with the King and the Royalists, while the other officers began to court the services of the Parliamentarian side. Nevertheless, the heralds petitioned Parliament in the same year, to protect their: \"Books of Record, Registers, Entries, Precedents, Arms, Pedigrees and Dignities.\" In 1643 the heralds joined the King at Oxford, and were with him at Naseby and followed him on all of his campaigns. Sir Edward Walker the Garter King of Arms (from 1645) was even appointed, with the permission of Parliament, to act as the King's chief secretary at the negotiations at Newport. After the execution of Charles I, Walker joined Charles II in his exile in the Netherlands.\nMeanwhile, on 3 August 1646 the Committee of Sequestration took possession of the College premises, and kept it under its own authority. Later in October, Parliament ordered the committee to directly remove those officers whose loyalties were with the King and to nominate their own candidates to fill these vacant offices. Those officers whose loyalty remained with the King were persecuted; first they were deprived of their offices, then of their emoluments, then a fine was imposed and some were even imprisoned. In spite of this, the institutional College was protected by the Parliamentarians, and their rights and work continued unabated. Edward Bysshe a Member of Parliament from Bletchingley was appointed Garter, thus \"Parliament which rejected its King created for itself a King of Arms\". During this time the heralds continued their work and were even present on 26 June 1657 at Oliver Cromwell's second installation ceremony as Lord Protector of the Commonwealth.\n\n\n=== Survival ===\n\nOn 8 May 1660, the heralds at the command of the Convention Parliament proclaimed Charles II, King at Westminster Hall Gate. It was said that William Ryley, who was originally appointed Lancaster Herald by Charles I but then sided with Cromwell, did not even have a tabard with the Royal Arms, as his own had been \"plundered in the wars\". He had to borrow a decorative one from the tomb of James I in Westminster Abbey instead; the garment was duly returned the next day. The Restoration of Charles II annulled all the Acts of the Parliament and all the actions of the Lord Protector, without penalising any of their supporters (except for the regicides). Accordingly, all the grant of arms of the Commonwealth College was declared null and void. Furthermore, all heralds appointed during the Interregnum lost their offices, while those appointed originally by Charles I returned to their places. The exception was Edward Bysshe, who was removed as Garter, but was instead appointed Clarenceux in 1661, much to the chagrin of Garter Edward Walker.\nIn 1666 as the Great Fire of London swept through the city, Derby Place, the College's home since 1555, was completely gutted and destroyed. Fortunately the College's library was saved, and at first was stored in the Palace of Whitehall, then later moved to the Palace of Westminster, where a temporary office was opened in an apartment called the Queen's court. An announcement was also made in the London Gazette to draw public notice to the situation. Due to a shortage of funds, the planned rebuilding of a new College was delayed until 1670. It was then that Francis Sandford, the Rouge Dragon Pursuivant and Morris Emmett, the King's bricklayer, were together able to design and begin construction of a new structure on the old site. The costs of the rebuilding was financed in stages, and the structure was erected slowly in parts. The heralds contributed significantly out of their own pockets; at the same time, they also sought subscriptions among the nobility, with the names of contributors recorded into a series of splendid manuscripts known as the Benefactors Books.\n\nBy 1683 the College part of the structure was finished. The new building was built out of plain bricks of three storeys, with basement and attic levels in addition. The College consists of an extensive range of quadrangular buildings. Apart from the hall, a porter's lodge and a public office, the rest of the building was given over to the heralds as accommodation. To the east and south sides three terraced houses were constructed for leases, their faÃ§ade in keeping with the original design. In 1699 the hall, which for some time had been used as a library, was transformed into the Earl Marshal's Court or the Court of Chivalry; it remains so to this day. In 1776 some stylistic changes were made to the exterior of the building and some details, such as pediments and cornices were removed, transforming the building to the then popular but austere Neo-Classical style.\nThe magnificent coronation of James II in 1685 saw the College revived as an institution of state and the monarchy. However, the abrupt end of his reign saw all but one of the heralds taking the side of William of Orange and Mary II in the Glorious Revolution. The period from 1704 to 1706 saw not a single grant of arms being made by the College; this nadir was attributed to the changes in attitude of the times. The Acts of Union 1707 between England and Scotland, in the reign of Anne did not affect the jurisdiction or the rights of the College. The College of Arms and the Court of the Lord Lyon were to exist side by side in their respective realms. However, in the matter of precedence; the Lord Lyon, when in England, was to take immediate precedence behind Garter King of Arms.\n\n\n=== Comfortable decay ===\n\nThe Hanoverian succession to the throne of Great Britain led to reigns with less ceremony than in any since the incorporation of the heralds. The only notable incident for the college in this period, during the reign of George I, happened in 1727 when an impostor called Robert Harman pretended to be a herald. The knave was prosecuted by the College in the county of Suffolk, and was sentenced to be pilloried in several market towns on public market days and afterwards to be imprisoned and pay a fine. This hefty sentence was executed, proving that the rights of the College were still respected. In 1737, during the reign of George II the College petitioned for another charter, to reaffirm their rights and remuneration; this effort proved unsuccessful. Apart from these events the influence of the College was greatly diminished.\nIn 1742 a Sugar House was built against the wall of the College. This structure was a fire risk and the cause of great anxiety among the heralds. In 1775 the College Surveyor drew attention to this problem, but to no avail. In February 1800, the College was asked by a Select Committee of the House of Commons to report to them the state of public records; again the heralds drew attention to the proximity of the Sugar House. Members of the committee inspected the College premises and reported to the House that the College must either be moved to a new building or secured against the risk of fire. Again nothing was done; in 1812 water seeped through the walls of the College damaging records. The Surveyor traced the leak back to a shed recently erected by Alderman Smith, owner of the Sugar House, who declared his readiness to do everything he could, but who actually did very little to rectify the situation. After years of negotiation the College, in 1820, bought the Sugar House from Smith for the sum of Â£1,500.\n\nGreat financial strains placed upon the College during these times were relieved when the extravagant Prince Regent (the future George IV) granted to the College an annual endowment by Royal Warrant on 29 February 1820. This generous endowment from the crown, the first since 1555, was applied towards the reparation and support of the College.\nDespite the successes of the purchase of the Sugar House and the royal endowment, the College still looked upon the possibility of moving its location to a more suitable and fashionable place. John Nash was at the same time laying out his plans for a new London, and, in 1822, the College, through the Deputy Earl Marshal, asked the government for a portion of land in the new districts on which to build a house to keep their records. A petition from the College was given to the Lords of the Treasury setting out the herald's reason for the move: \"that the local situation of the College is so widely detached from the proper scene of the official duties and occupations of Your Memorialists and from the residences of that class of persons by whom the records in their charge are chiefly and most frequently consulted.\"\nNash himself was asked by the College to design a new building near fashionable Trafalgar Square but Nash's elaborate plan proved too costly and ambitious for the College. At the same time the College also asked Robert Abraham to submit to them a second plan for the building. When Nash heard that another architect was approached behind his back he reacted vehemently, and attacked the heralds. The College nevertheless continued with their plans. However they were constantly beset by conflicts between the different officers over the amount needed to build a new building. By 1827 the college still had no coherent plan; the Duke of Norfolk ordered the College to drop the matter altogether. By 1842 the heralds were reconciled with their location and once again commissioned Abraham to build a new octagonal-shaped Record Room on the site of the old Sugar House.\nIn 1861 a proposal was made to construct a road from Blackfriars to the Mansion House; this would have resulted in the complete demolition of the College. However, protests from the heralds resulted in only parts of the south east and south west wings being sliced off, requiring extensive remodelling. The College was now a three-sided building with an open courtyard facing the New Queen Victoria Street laid out in 1866. The terrace, steps and entrance porch were also added around this time.\n\n\n=== Reform ===\n\nOn 18 October 1869, a warrant for a commission of inquiry into the state of the College was established. The warrant, issued on the behalf of the Duke of Norfolk, stated \"that it is desirable that the College of Arms should be visited, and an inquiry instituted with the view of ascertaining whether the Rules and Orders for the good government of the said College ... are duly obeyed and fulfilled ... and whether by change of circumstances or any other cause, any new Laws, Ordinances or Regulations are necessary to be made ... for the said College.\"\nThe commission had three members: Lord Edward Fitzalan-Howard (the Deputy Earl Marshal), Sir William Alexander (Queen's Counsel) and Edward Bellasis (a Sergeant at Law).\nSir Bernard Burke (of the famous Burke's Peerage), at the time Ulster King of Arms, gave the commission the advice that the College should \"be made a Government Department, let its Officers receive fixed salaries from Government, and let all its fees be paid into the public exchequer. This arrangement would, I am sure, be self-supporting and would raise at once the character of the Office and the status of the Heralds.\"\nBurke's suggestion for reform was the same arrangement that had already been applied to the Lord Lyon Court in Scotland in 1867, and was to be applied to his own office in 1871.\nHowever unlike the Lyon Court, which was a court of law and part of the Scottish Judiciary, the College of Arms has always been an independent corporate body overseen by the Earl Marshal.\nWhile the Lord Lyon depended on the Government for its reforms and statutes, the College has always been able to carry out changes from within itself.\nThe commission also drew attention to the fees, annulments and library of the College, as well as the general modernisation of the chapter as a whole.\nWhen the commission made its report in 1870, it recommended many changes, and these were duly made in another warrant dated 27 April 1871.\nBurke's recommendation, however, was not implemented.\n\nDespite the findings of this inquiry, the issues surrounding the status and position of the College continued. At the beginning of the 20th century these issues were once again brought to the forefront. In 1903 an inquiry was set up at the instructions of Arthur Balfour, soon to be Prime Minister. The committee of inquiry was to consist of eight members; Sir Algernon West was made chairman. They were tasked to investigate \"the constitution, duties and administration of the Heralds' College\"; the main issues being the anomalous position of the College, who are theoretically officials of the Royal Household, but actually derive their income from fees paid by private individuals for their services. Some of the members of the committee (a minority) wanted (like Burke thirty-four years earlier) to make officers of the College of Arms into \"salaried civil servants of the state\". Despite concluding that some form of change was necessary, the inquiry categorically stated that any change \"is at the present time and in present circumstances impracticable.\" In 1905 the generous endowment from the Crown (as instituted by George IV) was stopped by the Liberal Government of the day as part of its campaign against the House of Lords and the class system.\nA second inquiry was established in 1928 under the chairmanship of Lord Birkenhead. The inquiry was called soon after a secret memorandum, written in 1927, was circulated by the Home Office, criticising the constitution and workings of the heralds. The memorandum states that \"They have, as will be seen from this memorandum, in many cases attempted to interfere with the exercise by the Secretary of State of his constitutional responsibility for advising the Crown\", and that the College had \"adopted practices in connection with matters within their jurisdiction which seem highly improper in themselves, and calculated to bring the royal prerogative into contempt.\" These accusations concern the actions of certain heralds, who overzealously advocate the cases of their paid clients, even against the opposition of the ministers of the day. Sir Anthony Wagner writes that \"The officers of these departments, no doubt, in the overconfident way of their generation, esteemed the College an anachronistic and anomalous institution overdue for reform or abolition.\" The memorandum ended by saying that \"the College of Arms is a small and highly organised luxury trade, dependent for its living on supplying the demand for a fancy article among the well to do: and like many such trades it has in very many cases to create the demand before it can supply it.\"\nWhen the committee made their report in June 1928 they suggested several reforms to tackle the main issues which had brought the College into so much conflict with the Home Office. Firstly they concluded that the fees systems were adequate and no change was necessary in that regard. They justified this by stating that \"placing all or even a few of the Officers on a fixed salary outweigh any advantages which might be expected to result from the change.\" Secondly they concluded that from now on the College was to be entirely subordinated to the Home Office, and that a standing inter-departmental committee be established to settle any future conflicts.\n\n\n=== Present ===\n\nIn 1934, on the 450th anniversary of the incorporation of the College of Arms, an exhibition was held at the College of the heralds' principal treasures and other associated interests. The exhibition was opened by the Earl Marshal and ran from 28 June to 26 July, during which time it received more than 10,000 visitors, including the Duke (George VI) and Duchess of York (Elizabeth).\nIn 1939 at the beginning of the Second World War the College's records were moved to Thornbury Castle in Gloucestershire, the home of Major Algar Howard (the Norroy King of Arms). Meanwhile, on 10 and 11 May 1941 the College building was almost consumed by fire, which had already levelled all the buildings to the east of the College on Queen Victoria Street. The building was given up for lost, when a change in the wind saved it. At the end of the war, all of the records were returned safely to the College.\nIn 1943 the College was given new responsibilities when the office of Ulster King of Arms was annexed and combined with those of the Norroy King of Arms, creating a new office called Norroy and Ulster King of Arms; Sir Algar Howard thus became the first to hold this office.\nAlthough the College building was saved from the war, its walls and roof were left in a perilous state. In 1954 a decision was forced upon heralds, whether to abandon the old building (which would have been profitable financially) or repair it on a scale far beyond the College's resources. Eventually with the help of the Ministry of Works and a public subscription, the building was repaired in time for the College's 4th centenary of being in possession of Derby Place. The present gates to the building were added in 1956, and came originally from Goodrich Court in Herefordshire. The new gates displayed the College's arms and crest.\n\nIn the year of the quincentenary of the incorporation of the College of Arms, the College held a special service of thanksgiving at St Benet's, Paul's Wharf (the College's official church since 1555) on 2 March 1984. The Kings of Arms, Heralds and Pursuivants, ordinary and extraordinary, of the College in full uniform processed from the College towards the church together with Queen Elizabeth II, the Duke of Norfolk, the Earl Marshal and the Earl of Arundel, the Deputy Earl Marshal.\n\nOn 5 February 2009 a fire broke out at the west wing on the third and fourth floor of the College building. Eight London Fire Brigade fire engines were able to bring the flames under control, in the meantime 35 people were evacuated from the building and a further 100 from adjacent buildings. No records or books of the College were damaged. Repairs to the smoke-damaged rooms and exterior brickwork were completed in December 2009.\n\n\n== Roles ==\n\n\n=== Ceremonial ===\n\nThe College of Arms is a part of the Royal Household of the Sovereign of the United Kingdom. As such they accompany the monarch on various state occasions. These occasions are centred around the institution of the monarchy as the symbol of the state, and the expression of majesty and power through public pomp and ceremony. Currently the heralds appear in their full uniforms only twice a year: at the State Opening of Parliament and at the Garter Service at Windsor Castle in June. The organisation and planning of all State ceremonies falls within the prerogative of the Earl Marshal, the College's chief. As a result, the heralds have a role to perform within every significant royal ceremony.\nThe (usually annual) State Opening of Parliament takes place at the Houses of Parliament. The heralds, including both ordinary and extraordinary officers, form the front part of the Royal Procession, preceding the Sovereign and other Great Officers of State. The procession starts at the bottom of the Victoria Tower, then proceeds up the Norman Porch to the Robing Chamber. Once the Sovereign has put on the Imperial State Crown, the heralds lead the monarch once again through the Royal Gallery into the House of Lords, remain with the monarch during the speech and accompany the monarch to the bounds of the Palace.\nGarter Service or Garter Day is held in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle every June on the Monday of Royal Ascot week. On this occasion, new Companions of the Order of the Garter are personally invested with their insignia in the Throne Room of Windsor Castle by the Sovereign. All the members then have lunch in the Waterloo Chamber, wearing their blue velvet robes and black velvet hats with white plumes. Afterwards the members walk from the Upper Ward of the castle towards St George's Chapel. During their procession they are led by members of the College of Arms in their tabards, the Military Knights of Windsor and contingents of the Sovereign's Bodyguard. After the service, the members return to the Upper Ward by carriage. This ceremony is especially significant for the Garter King of Arms, the senior officer of the College, who is an officer of the Order.\n\nParticipation in these two annual ceremonies is considered the least time-consuming part of the herald's roles. However at other times they are involved in some of the most important ceremonies concerning the life of the British monarch. After the death of a Sovereign the Accession Council (made up of Privy Councillors and other officers such as the Lord Mayor of London) meets at St. James's Palace to make a formal proclamation of the accession of the next Sovereign. Traditionally, this proclamation is made by being physically read out. This task is assigned to the various members of the College by way of the Earl Marshal, who receives the text of the proclamation in person from the council. The proclamation is to be read at several locations in London. Traditionally the first reading is made from the Friary Court balcony at St James's Palace. Another reading and ceremony is held at Temple Bar. There a detachment of heralds, accompanied by troops of the Royal Horse Guards, formally demand admission to the precinct of the City of London from the City Marshall and City Remembrancer. The barrier, consisting of a silken rope (in place of the ancient bar), is then removed and the detachment marches forward to meet the Lord Mayor and City Sheriffs, where the proclamation would be read. There are also other readings by members of the College at the corner of Chancery Lane, in Fleet Street, and at the Royal Exchange.\nDuring the Coronation Ceremony, members of the College form part of the Royal procession as it enters Westminster Abbey. The members of the College walk in the procession in virtue of them being His Majesty's \"Kings, Heralds and Pursuivants of Arms of England.\" They do so alongside their Scottish colleagues: the Lord Lyon, the Heralds and Pursuivants of Arms of the Lyon Court. The Garter King of Arms is usually placed next to the Lord Great Chamberlain in the procession; he has the duty of guiding, but not performing, the ceremony. Garter's duties during the coronation ceremony are therefore not unlike those of a Master of Ceremonies. It is only during this ceremony that the Kings of Arms are allowed to wear their distinctive crowns, the only group of individuals, apart from the King and Queen, authorised to do so.\n\nAt State funerals the heralds once again take their place at the front of the royal procession as it enters the place of worship. Historically during the procession of royal funerals (usually of the Sovereign) the heralds would carry a piece of armour, representing the various marks of chivalry. These included the helm and crest, spurs, gauntlet, target (shield of arms), sword and a literal 'coat of arms' (a heraldic surcoat). This procession of chivalry was an integral part of the heraldic royal funeral. One of the most solemn roles for the heralds during a royal funeral is the reading of the full list of the styles and titles of the deceased monarch. On 9 April 2002, Garter King of Arms Peter Gwynn-Jones read out the full styles and titles of Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother at the end of her funeral service at Westminster Abbey.\n\n\n=== Granting and proving descent of arms ===\n\nThe granting of armorial bearings (coats of arms) within the United Kingdom is the sole prerogative of the British monarch. However, the monarch has delegated this power to two authorities: the Lord Lyon, with jurisdiction over Scotland, and the College of Arms, over England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Under the latter's jurisdiction, the right to arms is acquired exclusively either by proving descent in an unbroken male line from someone registered as so entitled or by a new grant from the King of Arms. Technically, however, arms can also be gained by a grant from the Crown, by prescription (meaning in use since time immemorial), by succeeding to an office, or by marriage. The descent of arms closely follows the Law of heraldic arms, which is a branch of English law, interpreted by civil lawyers in the Court of Chivalry. Sir Edward Coke in his Commentary upon Littleton (1628) wrote that \"gentry and armes is the nature of gavelkinde, for they descend to all the sonnes.\" Arms in England therefore descend to all of the male lines, and not just the most senior alone (unlike in Scotland).\nWhen a new grant of arms is to be made, it is granted through Letters Patent. The Crown delegates all of this authority to the King of Arms, however before any letters can be issued they must have a warrant from the Earl Marshal agreeing to the granting of arms. This has been the case since 1673, when the authority of the Earl Marshal, which the heralds had challenged, was established by a royal declaration stating, among other things, that no patents of arms should be granted without his consent. This established the present system whereby royal authority to approve candidates for grants of arms is exercised by the Earl Marshal, and royal authority to grant the arms themselves is exercised by the Kings of Arms. First a petition, called a memorial, is submitted to the Earl Marshal. This memorial will be drawn up for the petitioner by an officer of arms, if it is felt that such a petition would be accepted. Currently there are no set criteria for eligibility for a grant of arms; however the College recommends that \"awards or honours from the Crown, civil or military commissions, university degrees, professional qualifications, public and charitable services, and eminence or good standing in national or local life\" will be taken into account.\n\n\n=== History ===\n\nIn the past this issue of eligibility has been a source of great conflict between the heralds; such submissions are made on an officer for clients basis, which meant some \"unsuitability\" was ignored in lieu of profit by past officers. Suitability rested on the phrase \"eminent men\"; originally the test applied was one of wealth or social status, as any man entitled to bear a coat of arms was expected to be a gentleman. By 1530, the heralds applied a property qualification, requiring successful candidates for a grant of arms to have an income from land of Â£10 per annum, or movable wealth of Â£300. However this was not always the case: in 1616 Ralph Brooke, York Herald, tricked Garter King of Arms, William Segar, into granting a coat of arms to Gregory Brandon, a common hangman, for a fee of 22 shillings (Â£1.10). When the king found out he had them both imprisoned at Marshalsea; they were freed a few days later.\n\n\n=== Current procedure ===\nThe fee for the grant of arms is due when the memorial is submitted; the amount is set out in the Earl Marshal's Warrant. As of 1 January 2024 the fees for a personal grant of arms, including a crest, is Â£8,950; a grant to a non-profit body is Â£18,415; and to a commercial company is Â£27,450. This grant may include a grant of a badge, supporters or a standard, depending on the letters patent. The fees mainly go towards commissioning the artwork and calligraphy on the vellum Letters Patent, which must be done by hand and is in a sense a work of art in itself, plus other administrative costs borne by the heralds, and for the upkeep of the College.\nOnce the Earl Marshal has approved the petition he will issue his Warrant to the King of Arms. This will allow them to proceed with the granting of the arms. Now the designing and formation of the arms begin. Although the King of Arms has full discretion over the composition of the arms, he will take into full account the wishes of the applicant. These will include allusions and references to the applicant's life and achievements. The design of any new coat of arms must abide by all the rules of heraldry as well as being entirely original and distinct from all previous arms recorded in the College's archives. A preliminary sketch will then be approved and sent to the petitioner for approval.\n\nAs soon as the composition of the blazon is agreed by both parties a final grant can be created. This takes the form of a handmade colourfully illuminated and decorated Letters Patent. The letter is written and painted in vellum by a College artist and scrivener. The grant is then signed and sealed by the King of Arms. It is then handed to the petitioner, authorising the use of arms blazoned therein as the perpetual property of himself and his heirs. A copy of the grant is always made for the College's own register.\nOnce granted, a coat of arms becomes the hereditary and inheritable property of the owner and his descendants. But it can only be inherited by a legitimate male-line descendant of the original grantee of the arms. To establish the right to arms by descent, one must be able to prove that an ancestor had his arms recorded in the registers of the College. If there is a possibility of such an inheritance, one must first contact an officer-in-waiting at the College, who could then advise on the course of action and the cost of such a search. The research into a descent of arms requires details of paternal ancestry, which will involve the examination of genealogical records. First there is a search of the family name in the College's archives, as coats of arms and family name has no connection, the officer could prove, through this method, that there is in fact no descent. However, if a connection is found the genealogy would be researched outside of the College's archives to provide definitive evidence of descent from an armigerous individual.\n\n\n=== Change of names ===\nThe College of Arms is also an authorised location for enrolling a change of name. In common law there is no obligation to undergo any particular formality to change one's name. However, it is possible to execute a deed poll, more specifically a deed of change of name, as a demonstration of intention to adopt and henceforth use a new name, and deeds poll may be enrolled either in the High Court or in the College. On being enrolled the deed is customarily 'gazetted', that is published in the London Gazette. The deed poll is not entered on the registers, but is still published, if the name change only affects one's given name.\n\n\n=== Change of name and arms ===\nIt is also possible to change one's coat of arms, with or without adopting or appending a new surname, by Royal Licence, that is to say a licence in the form of a warrant from the Crown directed to the Kings of Arms instructing them to exemplify the transferred arms or a version of them to the licensee in his or her new name. Royal Licences are issued on the advice of Garter King of Arms and are usually dependent on there being some constraining circumstances such as a testamentary injunction (a requirement in a will) or a good reason to wish to perpetuate a particular coat of arms. The Royal Licence is of no effect until and unless the exemplification is issued and recorded in the College. Royal Licences are gazetted and make a deed poll unnecessary.\n\n\n=== Genealogical records ===\n\nDue to the inheritable nature of coats of arms the College have also been involved in genealogy since the 15th century. The College regularly conduct genealogical research for individuals with families in the British Isles of all social classes. As the College is also the official repository of genealogical materials such as pedigree charts and family trees. The College's extensive records within this realm of study dates back over five centuries. An individual could, if he so wishes, have his family's pedigree placed inside the College's records. This would require the services of an officer of the College who would then draft a pedigree. The officer would ensure that the pedigree was in the correct format and also advise the client on the documentary evidences necessary to supports such a draft. After this is done, the officer would submit the pedigree to a chapter of two other officers, who would then examine the pedigree for any mistakes or in some cases demand more research. After this examination is completed the pedigree would then be scrivened and placed into the pedigree register of the College.\n\n\n=== Roll of the Peerage ===\n\nThe House of Lords Act 1999 removed the automatic right of hereditary peers to a seat in the House of Lords. Prior to the passage of this Act, anyone succeeding to a title in the peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, would prove their succession by a writ of summons to Parliament. All peers receiving such writs were enrolled in the Register of Lords Spiritual and Temporal, a document maintained by the Clerk of the Parliaments. As a result of the Act, the Register of Lords Spiritual and Temporal only records the name of life peers and the 92 hereditary peers left in the House of Lords. This meant that the register was incomplete as it excludes most of the other hereditary peers, who are not part of the House of Lords.\nOn 1 June 2004 a Royal Warrant issued by Queen Elizabeth II states \"that it is desirable for a full record to be kept of all of Our subjects who are Peers\", this new record would be named the Roll of the Peerage. The warrant was later published in the London Gazette on 11 June 2004. The warrant handed the responsibility of maintaining the roll to the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, in 2007 this responsibility was assumed by the Crown Office within the newly created Ministry of Justice. The warrant also stipulated that the Secretary of State would act in consultation with the Garter King of Arms and the Lord Lyon King of Arms. The roll would then be published by the College of Arms; currently an online edition is available.\n\n\n=== Outside the UK ===\nThe College of Arms states that it is the \"official heraldic authority for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and much of the Commonwealth including Australia and New Zealand\". The position of New Zealand Herald Extraordinary was established in 1978, subordinate to the Garter Principal King of Arms. However, the official status of the college in Australia has not been confirmed by the federal government. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet advised in 2018 that grants from the College of Arms were \"well established as one way Australians can obtain heraldic insignia if they wish to do so\", but that they had the same status as those by \"a local artist, graphics studio or heraldry specialist\". The policy of the Australian Heraldry Society is that the College of Arms does not have official heraldic authority over Australia, but that the federal government should establish a national body equivalent to the Canadian Heraldic Authority or South Africa's Bureau of Heraldry.\n\n\n== Earl Marshal ==\n\nThe Earl Marshal is one of the Great Officers of State, and the office has existed since 1386. Many of the holders of the office have been related to each other; however, it was not until 1672 that the office became fully hereditary. In that year Henry Howard was appointed to the position by King Charles II. In 1677 he also succeeded to the Dukedom of Norfolk as the 6th Duke, thus combining the two titles for his successors.\nThe office originates from that of Marshal, one of the English monarch's chief military officers. As such he became responsible for all matters concerning war and together with the Lord High Constable held the joint post as judges of the Court of Chivalry. After the decline of medieval chivalry, the role of Earl Marshal came to concern all matters of state and royal ceremonies. By the 16th century this supervision came to include the College of Arms and its heralds. Thus the Earl Marshal became the head and chief of the College of Arms; all important matters concerning its governance, including the appointment of new heralds, must meet with his approval. The Earl Marshal also has authority over the flying of flags within England and Wales, as does Lord Lyon King of Arms in Scotland. The Officers of Arms at the College of Arms maintain the only official registers of national and other flags and they advise national and local Government, and other bodies and individuals, on the flying of flags.\n\n\n=== Court of Chivalry ===\n\nThe High Court of Chivalry or the Earl Marshal's Court is a specialised civil court in England, presided over by the Earl Marshal. The first references made about the court was in 1348. The court has jurisdiction over all matters relating to heraldry as it legalises and enforce decisions of the College of Arms. The court considers all cases relating to questions of status, including disputes over social rank and the law of arms, for example complaints on the infringement of the use of another individual's coat of arms. The Court of Chivalry meets on the premises of the College of Arms, however the last time it met was in 1954, the first time in 230 years.\n\n\n== Heralds of the College ==\nThe College of Arms is a corporation of thirteen heralds, styled Officers in Ordinary. This thirteen can be divided hierarchically into three distinctive ranks: three Kings of Arms, six Heralds of Arms and four Pursuivants of Arms. There are also presently seven Officers Extraordinary, who take part in ceremonial occasions but are not part of the College. As members of the Royal Household, the heralds are appointed at the pleasure of the Sovereign on the recommendation of the Earl Marshal. The Officers in Ordinary are appointed by Letters Patent under the Great Seal of the Realm, and the Officers Extraordinary by Royal Sign Manual; all appointments are announced in the London Gazette.\nAll of the officers in Ordinary of the College were first instituted at different dates (some even before the incorporation of the College), some originating as private servants of noblemen, some being Royal from the start. They take their names and badges from the titles and royal badges of the monarchs of England. The officers Extraordinary, however take their names from the titles and estates of the Earl Marshal, they were also created at different dates for ceremonial purposes.\n\n\n=== Wages ===\nThe College is almost entirely self-financed, and receives no regular public funding. Its officers do have official salaries, which are paid by the Crown. These salaries were increased in the reign of King James I, but were reduced under William IV. These annual salaries reflected the living costs of the day; however today the amount is merely a nominal payment. In addition to their official duties, the heralds have for many centuries undertaken private practice in heraldry and genealogy, for which professional fees are charged. HM Treasury pays Garter King of Arms for work undertaken for the Government. As of 27 January 2021, the payments made to Sir Thomas Woodcock since his appointment as Garter totalled Â£651,515. Additionally, since 2018, the Treasury has provided Garter with an expenses fund of Â£35,000 per annum to cover business expenses such as secretarial support, cleaning and postage. As of 27 January 2021, Garter has received Â£74,579.02 to cover expenses.\n\nNote: The right-hand column is merely the decimal equivalent of the 1831 column.\n\n\n=== Uniforms ===\n\nThe most recognisable item of the herald's wardrobe has always been their tabards. Since the 13th century, records of this distinctive garment were apparent. At first it is likely that the herald wore his master's cast-off coat, but even from the beginning that would have had special significance, signifying that he was in effect his master's representative. Especially when his master was a sovereign prince, the wearing of his coat would haven given the herald a natural diplomatic status. John Anstis wrote that: \"The Wearing the outward Robes of the Prince, hath been esteemed by the Consent of Nations, to be an extraordinary Instance of Favour and Honour, as in the Precedent of Mordecai, under a king of Persia.\" (a reference to the Book of Esther). The last King of England to have worn a tabard with his arms was probably King Henry VII. Today the herald's tabard is a survivor of history, much like the judges' wigs and (until the last century) the bishop's gaiters.\n\nThe tabards of the different officers can be distinguished by the type of fabric used to make them. A tabard of a King of Arms is made of velvet and cloth of gold, the tabard of a Herald of satin, and that of a Pursuivant of damask silk. The tabards of all heralds (Ordinary and Extraordinary) are inscribed with the Sovereign's royal arms, richly embroidered. It was once the custom for pursuivants to wear their tabards with the sleeves at the front and back, in fact in 1576 a pursuivant was fined for presuming to wear his tabard like a herald, but this practice was ended during the reign of James II. Until 1888 all tabards were provided to the heralds by the Crown; however in that year a parsimonious Treasury refused to ask Parliament for funds for the purpose. Ever since then heralds either paid for their own tabards or bought the one used by their predecessors. The newest tabard was made in 1963 for the Welsh Herald Extraordinary. A stock of them is now held by the Lord Chamberlain, from which a loan \"during tenure of office\" is made upon each appointment. They are often sent to Ede & Ravenscroft for repair or replacement. In addition, heralds and pursuivants wear black velvet caps with a badge embroidered.\n\nApart from the tabards, the heralds also wear scarlet court uniforms with gold embroidery during formal events; with white breeches and stockings for coronations and black for all other times together with black patent court shoes with gold buckles (the Scottish heralds wear black wool serge military style trousers with wide gold oak leaf lace on the side seams and black patent ankle boots; or for women, a long black skirt). The heralds are also entitled to distinctive sceptres, which have been a symbol of their office since the Tudor period. In 1906 new sceptres were made, most likely the initiative of Sir Alfred Scott-Gatty. These take the form of short black batons with gilded ends, each with a representation of the badges of the different offices of the heralds. In 1953 these were replaced by white staves, with gilded metal handles and at its head a blue dove in a golden coronet or a \"martinet\". These blue martinets are derived from the arms of the College. Another of the heralds' insignia of office is the Collar of SS, which they wear over their uniforms. During inclement weather, a large black cape is worn. At state funerals, they would wear a wide sash of black silk sarsenet (a thin tissue of fine silk) over their tabards. (In ancient times, they would have worn long black hooded cloaks under their tabards.)\nThe three Kings of Arms have also been entitled to wear a crown since the 13th century. However, it was not until much later that the specific design of the crown was regulated. The silver-gilt crown is composed of sixteen acanthus leaves alternating in height, inscribed with a line from Psalm 51 in Latin: Miserere mei Deus secundum magnam misericordiam tuam (KJV: Have mercy upon me O God according to thy lovingkindness). Within the crown is a cap of crimson velvet, lined with ermine, having at the top a large tuft of tassels, wrought in gold. In medieval times the kings of arms were required to wear their crowns and attend to the Sovereign on four high feasts of the year: Christmas, Easter, Whitsuntide and All Saint's Day. Today, the crown is reserved for the most solemn of occasions. The last time these crowns were worn was at the coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla in 2023. At other times, kings of arms wear a black bicorne trimmed with white ostrich feathers when performing duties outdoors, or a black velvet cap, depending on circumstances of occasion.\nThe New Zealand Herald of Arms Extraordinary is a special case when it comes to uniform. Although they do wear the tabard, they only do so when in the UK performing duties. When in New Zealand, they simply wear morning dress as official uniform, together with their chains and baton.\n\n\n=== Qualifications ===\n\nThere are no formal qualifications for a herald, but certain specialist knowledge and discipline are required. Most of the current officers are trained lawyers and historians. Noted heraldist and writer Sir John Ferne wrote in The Glory of Generositie in 1586 that a herald \"ought to be a Gentlemen and an Old man not admitting into that sacred office everie glasier, painter & tricker, or a meere blazonner of Armes: for to the office of a herald is requisite the skill of many faculties and professions of literature, and likewise the knowledge of warres.\" Some of the greatest scholars and eminent antiquarians of their age were members of the College, such as Robert Glover, William Camden, Sir William Dugdale, Elias Ashmole, John Anstis, Sir Anthony Wagner and John Brooke-Little.\nEven with these examples, many controversial appointments were made throughout the College's history. For example, in 1704 the architect and dramatist Sir John Vanbrugh was appointed Clarenceux King of Arms, although he knew little of heraldry and genealogy and was known to have ridiculed both. Nevertheless, he was also described as \"possibly the most distinguished man who has ever worn a herald's tabard.\" Noted antiquarian William Oldys, appointed Norroy King of Arms in 1756, was described as being \"rarely sober in the afternoon, never after supper\", and \"much addicted to low company\".\n\n\n=== List of heralds ===\n\n\n==== Officers in Ordinary ====\n\n\n==== Officers Extraordinary ====\n\n\n== Armorial achievement of the College ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nOther institutions linked to the College of Arms\n\nSt Benet Paul's Wharf â The official church of the College\nHeralds' Museum  â  Former museum displaying objects from the College, situated within Waterloo Barracks, Tower of London (now closed).\nWhite Lion Society  â  founded in 1986 as a society to benefit the College of Arms through donations of useful items and publications.\nThe Heraldry Society â An organisation devoted to the studying of heraldry.\nSimilar heraldic authorities in other parts of the world\n\nCourt of the Lord Lyon â Scotland, United Kingdom\nCanadian Heraldic Authority â Canada\nGenealogical Office â Republic of Ireland\nCouncil of Heraldry and Vexillology - French Community, Belgium\nFlemish Heraldic Council â Flemish Community, Belgium\nBureau of Heraldry â South Africa\nNational Archives of Sweden\nUnited States Army Institute of Heraldry\nSubjects under the jurisdiction of the College\n\nEnglish heraldry\nWelsh heraldry\nNorthern Irish Heraldry\nAustralian heraldry\nNew Zealand heraldry\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nWagner, Sir Anthony; Godfrey, Walter H.

    "wikipediaText": "St Andrew-by-the-Wardrobe is a Church of England church located on Queen Victoria Street, London in the City of London, near Blackfriars station.\n\n\n== History ==\nFirst mentioned around 1170, St Andrew-by-the-Wardrobe was almost certainly founded considerably earlier. During the 13th century the church was a part of Baynard's Castle, an ancient royal residence.  In 1361, Edward III moved his Royal Wardrobe (a storehouse for Royal accoutrements, housing arms and clothing among other personal items of the Crown) from the Tower of London to just north of the church. It was from this association that the church acquired its unique name.\nThe Wardrobe and the church, however, were both lost in the Great Fire of London in 1666. Of the 51 churches designed by Sir Christopher Wren after the Great Fire, St Andrew-by-the-Wardrobe is among the simplest of his designs; it was erected in 1695.\nThe church was again gutted during the London blitz by German bombing; only the tower and walls survived. It was rebuilt and rededicated in 1961.\n\n\n=== Present day ===\nAs the parish of St Andrew-by-the-Wardrobe rejects the ordination of women, it receives alternative episcopal oversight from the Bishop of Fulham (currently Jonathan Baker).\n\n\n== Advowson ==\nThe advowson of St Andrew's was anciently held by the family of FitzWalter to which it probably came from the holding by Robert Fitzwalter (d.1235) of the office of Constable of Baynard's Castle. In 1417 it was held by Thomas de Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley (d.1417), as his charter dated 24 June 1417 appointing feoffees to his estate records. Berkeley's Inn, the town house of that family stood nearby, at the south end of Adle Street, against Puddle Wharf, as reported by John Stow in his \"Survey of London\" (1598)\n\n\n== Building ==\n\nSt Andrew's is situated on a terrace overlooking the street, its plain red-brick exterior contrasting with the stone buildings on either side. The interior is aisled, with arcaded bays supported by piers rather than the usual columns. The original interior fittings were mostly destroyed during the war, and many of the church's features were procured from other destroyed Wren churches. The weathervane on the steeple comes from St Michael Bassishaw (which was demolished in 1900). A replacement pulpit came from the church of St Matthew, Friday Street. The font and cover also came from here. The royal arms, of the House of Stuart, came from St Olave Old Jewry (demolished, except for its tower, in 1887). There is a figure of St Andrew, dated around 1600, which stands on the north side of the sanctuary and an unusual figure of Saint Anne who is shown holding the Virgin Mary who in turn holds the Christ child. This statue, which is probably north Italian, dates to around 1500.\nWilliam Shakespeare was a member of this parish for about fifteen years while he was working at the Blackfriars Theatre nearby, and later he bought a house within the parish, in Ireland Yard. In his honour, a memorial was erected in the church.\nRegular Sunday services are conducted there by the St Gregorios congregation of the Indian Orthodox Church.\nThe church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.\n\n\n== Notable clergy ==\nGuy Treweek (husband of Rachel Treweek, the first female diocesan bishop in the Church of England), was priest-in-charge from 2011 to 2015\nLuke Miller; rector since 2016, priest-in-charge from 2015 to 2016\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of churches and cathedrals of London\nList of Christopher Wren churches in London\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nLocation map (Multimap.com)\n360Â° panorama inside St Andrew-by-the-Wardrobe"

    "wikipediaText": "St Andrew Undershaft is a Church of England church in the City of London, the historic nucleus and modern financial centre of London. It is located on St Mary Axe, within the Aldgate ward, and is a rare example of a City church that survived both the Great Fire of London and the Blitz.\nThe present building was constructed in 1532 but a church has existed on the site since the 12th century. Today, St Andrew Undershaft is administered from the nearby St Helen's Bishopsgate church.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first church on the site, which today is bordered by St Mary Axe and Leadenhall Street, was built in medieval times, being recorded in 1147.  It was rebuilt in the 14th century and again in 1532; this third incarnation of the building survives today. It is in the Perpendicular style with its entrance located at the base of its off-centre tower. The interior is divided into six bays, with many of the original fittings that survived the Victorian renovation. Formerly, St Andrew Undershaft had one of London's few surviving large stained-glass windows, installed in the 17th century, but this was destroyed in the Baltic Exchange bombing in 1992.\n\nThe church's curious name derives from the shaft of the maypole  that was traditionally set up each year opposite the church.  The custom continued each spring until 1517, when student riots put an end to it, but the maypole itself survived until 1547 when it was seized by a mob and destroyed as a \"pagan idol\". According to John Stow, the chronicler who is buried here, they had it \"raised from the hooks whereon it had rested for two-and-thirty years, sawn in pieces and burnt.\"\nSt Andrew Undershaft is now administered from the nearby church of St Helen's Bishopsgate. St Andrew Undershaft was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.\nThe tower holds a peal of six bells in the key of G, with the tenor being cast in 1597 by Robert Mot. These are now hung dead (they can only be rung stationary) inside the tower.\n\n\n== Organ ==\n\nThe organ was installed in 1696 by Renatus Harris. A swell was added in 1750 by John Byfield. There have been other restorations and enhancements by George Pike England in 1810â11 and 1826. Further work was carried out by William Hill, Speechly and J. W. Walker & Sons, and Rushworth and Dreaper. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register\nThe organ is of such historic significance that it has been awarded a Grade I historic organ certificate by the British Institute of Organ Studies.\n\n\n=== Organists ===\nWilliam Goodgroome, 1696\nPhilip Hart, 1697â1749\nJohn Worgan, 1749â1790\nMary Allen, 1790â1836\nRichard Limpus, 1847\nWilliam Rea, 1847â1858\nElizabeth Stirling, 1858â1880\nC.

Ballard, 1913â1921\n\n\n== Notable people associated with the church ==\nSir Thomas Offley, Lord Mayor of London 1563â64, was buried in 1582. The monument to Sir Thomas and his wife Joan (died 1578) survives in St Andrew Undershaft. Joan was a granddaughter of Sir Stephen Jennings, Lord Mayor, who funded the rebuilding of the church.\nJohn Stow, author of the Survey of London: buried in 1605. The quill pen held in the hand of his alabaster monument is renewed periodically by, alternately, the Lord Mayor of London and the Master of the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors, at a memorial service organised by the London and Middlesex Archaeological Society.\nHugh Hamersley, Lord Mayor of London in 1627, whose memorial is in St Andrew Undershaft.\nHans Holbein the Younger, a former parishioner of St Andrew Undershaft was possibly buried in the church.\nFrederick George Blomfield, rector of St Andrew Undershaft (1853â1879), son of Charles James Blomfield (Bishop of London) and father of Dorothy Gurney (poet and hymn writer).\nJohn Lawrence Toole, a comedian who was born and christened in St Andrew Undershaft.\nFabian Stedman the father of church bellringing was buried in St Andrew Undershaft.\nSir William Perkins, eminent merchant and founder of a charity school in Chertsey in 1725 for twenty-five boys and later twenty-five girls (Sir William Perkins's School), buried in St Andrew Undershaft in 1741\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of buildings that survived the Great Fire of London\nList of churches in London\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nSt Helen's Bishopsgate"

    "wikipediaText": "St Paul's Cathedral, formally the Cathedral Church of St Paul the Apostle, is an Anglican cathedral in London, England, the seat of the Bishop of London. The cathedral serves as the mother church of the Diocese of London. It is on Ludgate Hill at the highest point of the City of London. Its dedication in honour of Paul the Apostle dates back to the original church on this site, founded in AD 604. The present structure, which was completed in 1710, is a Grade I listed building that was designed in the English Baroque style by Sir Christopher Wren. The cathedral's reconstruction was part of a major rebuilding programme initiated in the aftermath of the Great Fire of London. The earlier Gothic cathedral (Old St Paul's Cathedral), largely destroyed in the Great Fire, was a central focus for medieval and early modern London, including Paul's walk and St Paul's Churchyard, being the site of St Paul's Cross.\nThe cathedral is one of the most famous and recognisable sights of London. Its dome, surrounded by the spires of Wren's City churches, has dominated the skyline for over 300 years. At 365 ft (111 m) high, it was the tallest building in London from 1710 to 1963. The dome is still one of the highest in the world. St Paul's is the second-largest church building in area in the United Kingdom, after Liverpool Cathedral.\nServices held at St Paul's have included the funerals of Admiral Lord Nelson, the Duke of Wellington, Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher; jubilee celebrations for Queen Victoria; an inauguration service for the Metropolitan Hospital Sunday Fund; peace services marking the end of the First and Second World Wars; the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer; the launch of the Festival of Britain; and the thanksgiving services for the Silver, Golden, Diamond, and Platinum Jubilees and the 80th and 90th birthdays of Queen Elizabeth II. St Paul's Cathedral is the central subject of much promotional material, as well as of images of the dome surrounded by the smoke and fire of the Blitz.\nThe cathedral is a working church with hourly prayer and daily services. The tourist entry fee at the door is Â£25 for adults (January 2024) but no charges are made to worshippers attending services, or for private prayer.\nThe nearest London Underground station is St Paul's, which is 130 yards (120 m) away from St Paul's Cathedral.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Before the cathedral ===\nThe location of Londinium's original cathedral is unknown, but legend and medieval tradition claims it was St Peter upon Cornhill. St Paul is an unusual attribution for a cathedral, and suggests there was another one in the Roman period. Legends of St Lucius link St Peter upon Cornhill as the centre of the Roman Londinium Christian community. It stands upon the highest point in the area of old Londinium, and it was given pre-eminence in medieval procession on account of the legends. There is, however, no other reliable evidence and the location of the site on the Forum makes it difficult for it to fit the legendary stories. In 1995, a large fifth-century building on Tower Hill was excavated, and has been claimed as a Roman basilica, possibly a cathedral, although this is speculative. \nThe Elizabethan antiquarian William Camden argued that a temple to the goddess Diana had stood during Roman times on the site occupied by the medieval St Paul's Cathedral. Wren reported that he had found no trace of any such temple during the works to build the new cathedral after the Great Fire, and Camden's hypothesis is no longer accepted by modern archaeologists.\n\n\n=== Pre-Norman cathedral ===\nThere is evidence for Christianity in London during the Roman period, but no firm evidence for the location of churches or a cathedral. Bishop Restitutus is said to have represented London at the Council of Arles in 314 AD. A list of the 16 \"archbishops\" of London was recorded by Jocelyn of Furness in the 12th century, claiming London's Christian community was founded in the second century under the legendary King Lucius and his missionary saints Fagan, Deruvian, Elvanus and Medwin. None of that is considered credible by modern historians but, although the surviving text is problematic, either Bishop Restitutus or Adelphius at the 314 Council of Arles seems to have come from Londinium.\nBede records that in AD 604 Augustine of Canterbury consecrated Mellitus as the first bishop to the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of the East Saxons and their king, SÃ¦berht. SÃ¦berht's uncle and overlord, Ãthelberht, king of Kent, built a church dedicated to St Paul in London, as the seat of the new bishop. It is assumed, although not proved, that this first Anglo-Saxon cathedral stood on the same site as the later medieval and the present cathedrals. \nOn the death of SÃ¦berht in about 616, his pagan sons expelled Mellitus from London, and the East Saxons reverted to paganism. The fate of the first cathedral building is unknown. Christianity was restored among the East Saxons in the late seventh century and it is presumed that either the Anglo-Saxon cathedral was restored or a new building erected as the seat of bishops such as Cedd, Wine and Erkenwald, the last of whom was buried in the cathedral in 693.\nEarconwald was consecrated bishop of London in 675, and is said to have bestowed great cost on the fabric, and in later times he almost occupied the place of traditionary, founder: the veneration paid to him is second only to that which was rendered to St. Paul. Erkenwald would become a subject of the important High Medieval poem St Erkenwald.\nKing Ãthelred the Unready was buried in the cathedral on his death in 1016; the tomb is now lost. The cathedral was burnt, with much of the city, in a fire in 1087, as recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.\n\n\n=== Old St Paul's ===\n\n \n\nThe fourth St Paul's, generally referred to as Old St Paul's, was begun by the Normans after the 1087 fire. A further fire in 1135 disrupted the work, and the new cathedral was not consecrated until 1240. During the period of construction, the style of architecture had changed from Romanesque to Gothic and this was reflected in the pointed arches and larger windows of the upper parts and East End of the building. The Gothic ribbed vault was constructed, like that of York Minster, of wood rather than stone, which affected the ultimate fate of the building.\nAn enlargement programme commenced in 1256. This \"New Work\" was consecrated in 1300 but not complete until 1314. During the later Medieval period St Paul's was exceeded in length only by the Abbey Church of Cluny and in the height of its spire only by Lincoln Cathedral and St. Mary's Church, Stralsund. Excavations by Francis Penrose in 1878 showed that it was 585 feet (178 m) long and 100 feet (30 m) wide (290 feet (88 m) across the transepts and crossing). The spire was about 489 feet (149 m) in height. By the 16th century the building was deteriorating.\nThe English Reformation under Henry VIII and Edward VI (accelerated by the Chantries Acts) led to the destruction of elements of the interior ornamentation and the chapels, shrines, and chantries.\nThe Reformation would come to include the removal of the cathedral's collection of relics, which by the sixteenth century was understood to include:\n\nthe body of St Erkenwald\nboth arms of St Mellitus\na knife thought to belong to Jesus\nhair of Mary Magdalene\nblood of St Paul\nmilk of the Virgin Mary\nthe head of St John\nthe skull of Thomas Becket\nthe head and jaw of King Ethelbert\npart of the wood of the cross,\na stone of the Holy Sepulchre,\na stone from the spot of the Ascension, and\nsome bones of the eleven thousand virgins of Cologne.\n\nIn October 1538, an image of St Erkenwald, probably from the shrine, was delivered to the master of the king's jewels. Other images may have survived, at least for a time. More systematic iconoclasm happened in the reign of Edward VI: the Grey Friar's Chronicle reports that the rood and other images were destroyed in November 1547.\nIn late 1549, at the height of the iconoclasm of the reformation, Sir Rowland Hill altered the route of his Lord Mayor's day procession and said a de profundis at the tomb of Erkenwald. Later in Hill's mayoralty of (1550) the high altar of St Paul's was removed overnight to be destroyed, an occurrence that provoked a fight in which a man was killed. Hill had ordered, unusually for the time, that St Barnabas's Day would not be kept as a public holiday ahead of these events.\nThree years later, by October 1553, \"Alle the alteres and chappelles in alle Powlles churche\" were taken down. In August 1553, the dean and chapter were cited to appear before Queen Mary's commissioners.\nSome of the buildings in the St Paul's churchyard were sold as shops and rental properties, especially to printers and booksellers. In 1561 the spire was destroyed by a lightning strike, an event that Roman Catholic writers claimed was a sign of God's judgment on England's Protestant rulers. Bishop James Pilkington preached a sermon in response, claiming that the lightning strike was a judgement for the irreverent use of the cathedral building. Immediate steps were taken to repair the damage, with the citizens of London and the clergy offering money to support the rebuilding. However, the cost of repairing the building properly was too great for a country and city recovering from a trade depression. Instead, the roof was repaired and a timber \"roo\"â put on the steeple.\nIn the 1630s a west front was added to the building by England's first classical architect, Inigo Jones. There was much defacing and mistreatment of the building by Parliamentarian forces during the Civil War, and the old documents and charters were dispersed and destroyed. During the Commonwealth, those churchyard buildings that were razed supplied ready-dressed building material for construction projects, such as the Lord Protector's city palace, Somerset House. Crowds were drawn to the north-east corner of the churchyard, St Paul's Cross, where open-air preaching took place.\nIn the Great Fire of London of 1666, Old St Paul's was gutted. While it might have been possible to reconstruct it, a decision was taken to build a new cathedral in a modern style. This course of action had been proposed even before the fire.\n\n\n=== Present St Paul's ===\n\nThe task of designing a replacement structure was officially assigned to Sir Christopher Wren on 30 July 1669. He had previously been put in charge of the rebuilding of churches to replace those lost in the Great Fire. More than 50 city churches are attributable to Wren. Concurrent with designing St Paul's, Wren was engaged in the production of his five Tracts on Architecture.\nWren had begun advising on the repair of the Old St Paul's in 1661, five years before the fire in 1666. The proposed work included renovations to interior and exterior to complement the classical facade designed by Inigo Jones in 1630. Wren planned to replace the dilapidated tower with a dome, using the existing structure as a scaffold. He produced a drawing of the proposed dome which shows his idea that it should span nave and aisles at the crossing. After the Fire, it was at first thought possible to retain a substantial part of the old cathedral, but ultimately the entire structure was demolished in the early 1670s.\nIn July 1668 Dean William Sancroft wrote to Wren that he was charged by the Archbishop of Canterbury, in agreement with the Bishops of London and Oxford, to design a new cathedral that was \"Handsome and noble to all the ends of it and to the reputation of the City and the nation\". The design process took several years, but a design was finally settled and attached to a royal warrant, with the proviso that Wren was permitted to make any further changes that he deemed necessary. The result was the present St Paul's Cathedral, still the second largest church in Britain, with a dome proclaimed as the finest in the world. The building was financed by a tax on coal, and was completed within its architect's lifetime with many of the major contractors engaged for the duration.\nThe \"topping out\" of the cathedral (when the final stone was placed on the lantern) took place on 26 October 1708, performed by Wren's son Christopher Jr and the son of one of the masons. The cathedral was declared officially complete by Parliament on 25 December 1711 (Christmas Day). In fact, construction continued for several years after that, with the statues on the roof added in the 1720s. In 1716 the total costs amounted to Â£1,095,556 (Â£207 million in 2023).\n\n\n==== Consecration ====\nOn 2 December 1697, 31 years and 3 months after the Great Fire destroyed Old St Paul's, the new cathedral was consecrated for use. The Right Reverend Henry Compton, Bishop of London, preached the sermon. It was based on the text of Psalm 122, \"I was glad when they said unto me: Let us go into the house of the Lord.\" The first regular service was held on the following Sunday.\nOpinions of Wren's cathedral differed, with some loving it: \"Without, within, below, above, the eye / Is filled with unrestrained delight\", while others hated it: \"There was an air of Popery about the gilded capitals, the heavy arches ... They were unfamiliar, un-English ...\".\n\n\n=== Since 1900 ===\n\n\n==== Suffragette terror attacks ====\n\nSt. Paul's was the target of two suffragette bombing attacks in 1913 and 1914 respectively. This was as part of the suffragette bombing and arson campaign between 1912 and 1914, in which suffragettes from the Women's Social and Political Union, as part of their campaign for women's suffrage, carried out a series of politically motivated bombings and arson nationwide. Churches were explicitly targeted by the suffragettes as they believed the Church of England was complicit in reinforcing opposition to women's suffrage. Between 1913 and 1914, 32 churches across Britain were attacked.\nThe first attack on St. Paul's occurred on 8 May 1913, at the start of a sermon. A bomb was heard ticking and discovered as people were entering the cathedral. It was made out of potassium nitrate. Had it exploded, the bomb likely would have destroyed the historic bishop's throne and other parts of the cathedral. The remains of the device, which was made partly out of a mustard tin, are now on display at the City of London Police Museum.\nA second bombing of the cathedral by the suffragettes was attempted on 13 June 1914, however the bomb was again discovered before it could explode. This attempted bombing occurred two days after a bomb had exploded at Westminster Abbey, which damaged the Coronation Chair and caused a mass panic for the exits. Several other churches were bombed at this time, such as St Martin-in-the-Fields church in Trafalgar Square and the Metropolitan Tabernacle.\n\n\n==== War damage ====\n\nThe cathedral survived the Blitz although struck by bombs on 10 October 1940 and 17 April 1941. The first strike destroyed the high altar, while the second strike on the north transept left a hole in the floor above the crypt. The latter bomb is believed to have detonated in the upper interior above the north transept and the force was sufficient to shift the entire dome laterally by a small amount.\nOn 12 September 1940 a time-delayed bomb that had struck the cathedral was successfully defused and removed by a bomb disposal detachment of Royal Engineers under the command of Temporary Lieutenant Robert Davies. Had this bomb detonated, it would have totally destroyed the cathedral; it left a 100-foot (30 m) crater when later remotely detonated in a secure location. As a result of this action, Davies and Sapper George Cameron Wylie were each awarded the George Cross. Davies' George Cross and other medals are on display at the Imperial War Museum, London.\nOne of the best known images of London during the war was a photograph of St Paul's taken on 29 December 1940 during the \"Second Great Fire of London\" by photographer Herbert Mason, from the roof of a building in Tudor Street showing the cathedral shrouded in smoke. Lisa Jardine of Queen Mary, University of London, has written:\n\nWreathed in billowing smoke, amidst the chaos and destruction of war, the pale dome stands proud and gloriousâindomitable. At the height of that air-raid, Sir Winston Churchill telephoned the Guildhall to insist that all fire-fighting resources be directed at St Paul's. The cathedral must be saved, he said, damage to the fabric would sap the morale of the country.\n\n\n==== Post-war ====\nOn 29 July 1981, the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer was held at the cathedral. The couple selected St Paul's over Westminster Abbey, the traditional site of royal weddings, because the cathedral offered more seating.\nExtensive copper, lead and slate renovation work was carried out on the Dome in 1996 by John B. Chambers. A 15-year restoration projectâone of the largest ever undertaken in the UKâwas completed on 15 June 2011.\n\n\n==== Occupy London ====\n\nIn October 2011 an anti-capitalism Occupy London encampment was established in front of the cathedral, after failing to gain access to the London Stock Exchange at Paternoster Square nearby. The cathedral's finances were affected by the ensuing closure. It was claimed that the cathedral was losing revenue of Â£20,000 per day. Canon Chancellor Giles Fraser resigned, asserting his view that \"evicting the anti-capitalist activists would constitute violence in the name of the Church\". The Dean of St Paul's, the Right Revd Graeme Knowles, then resigned too. The encampment was evicted at the end of February 2012, by court order and without violence, as a result of legal action by the City of London Corporation.\n\n\n==== 2019 terrorist plot ====\nOn 10 October 2019, Safiyya Amira Shaikh, a Muslim convert, was arrested following an MI5 and Metropolitan Police investigation. In September 2019, she had taken photos of the cathedral's interior. While trying to radicalise others using the Telegram messaging software, she planned to attack the cathedral and other targets such as a hotel and a train station using explosives. Shaikh pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\n\n== National events ==\n\nThe size and location of St Paul's has made it an ideal setting for Christian services marking great national events. The opportunity for long processions culminating in the dramatic approach up Ludgate Hill, the open area and steps at the west front, the great nave and the space under the dome are all well suited for ceremonial occasions. St Paul's can seat many more people than any other church in London, and in past centuries, the erection of temporary wooden galleries inside allowed for congregations exceeding 10,000. In 1935, the dean, Walter Matthews, wrote:\n\nNo description in words can convey an adequate idea of the majestic beauty of a solemn national religious ceremony in St Paul's. It is hard to believe that there is any other building in the world that is so well adapted to be the setting of such symbolical acts of communal worship.\nNational events attended by the royal family, government ministers and officers of state include national services of thanksgiving, state funerals and a royal wedding. Some of the most notable examples are:\n\nThanksgiving service for the Acts of Union 1707, 1 May 1707\nState funeral of Horatio Nelson, 9 January 1806\nState funeral of the Duke of Wellington, 18 November 1852\nDiamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria, 22 June 1897\nThanksgiving service for the Treaty of Versailles, 6 July 1919\nSilver Jubilee of George V, 6 May 1935\nThanksgiving services for VE Day and VJ Day, 13 May and 19 August 1945\nState funeral of Winston Churchill, 30 January 1965\nSilver Jubilee of Elizabeth II, 7 June 1977\nWedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, 29 July 1981\nGolden Jubilee of Elizabeth II, 4 June 2002\nDiamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II, 5 June 2012\nCeremonial funeral of Margaret Thatcher, 17 April 2013\nThanksgiving service for the Queen's 90th Birthday, 10 June 2016\nPlatinum Jubilee National Service of Thanksgiving, 3 June 2022\n\n\n== Ministry and functions ==\n\nSt Paul's Cathedral is a busy church with four or five services every day, including Matins, Eucharist and Evening Prayer or Choral Evensong. In addition, the cathedral has many special services associated with the City of London, its corporation, guilds and institutions. The cathedral, as the largest church in London, also has a role in many state functions such as the service celebrating the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. The cathedral is generally open daily to tourists and has a regular programme of organ recitals and other performances. The Bishop of London is Sarah Mullally, whose appointment was announced in December 2017 and whose enthronement took place in May 2018.\n\n\n=== Dean and chapter ===\n\nThe cathedral chapter is currently composed of seven individuals: the dean, three residentiary canons (one of whom is, exceptionally, lay), one \"additional member of chapter and canon non-residentiary\" (ordained), and two lay canons. Each has a different responsibility in the running of the cathedral. As of October 2022:\n\nDean: Andrew Tremlett (since 25 September 2022)\nPrecentor: vacant \nTreasurer: vacant\nChancellor: Paula Gooder (since 9 May 2019; lay reader since 23 February 2019)\nSteward: Neil Evans (since June 2022)\nAdditional member of chapter and canon non-residentiary: Sheila Watson (since January 2017).\nLay Canon: Pamela (Pim) Jane Baxter (since March 2014). Deputy Director at the National Portrait Gallery, with experience in opera, theatre and the visual arts.\nLay Canon: Sheila Nicoll (since October 2018). She is Head of Public Policy at Schroder Investment Management.\nLay Canon: Clement Hutton-Mills (since March 2021). He is also a Managing Director at Goldman Sachs.\nLay Canon: Gillian Bowen (since June 2022). She is Chief Executive Officer of YMCA London City and North and is a magistrate.\n\n\n=== Minor canons and priest vicar ===\n\n\n=== Director of Music ===\nThe Director of Music is Andrew Carwood. Carwood was appointed to succeed Malcolm Archer as Director of Music, taking up the post in September 2007. He is the first non-organist to hold the post since the 12th century.\n\n\n==== Organs ====\n\nAn organ was commissioned from Bernard Smith in 1694.\nIn 1862 the organ from the Panopticon of Science and Art (the Panopticon Organ) was installed in a gallery over the south transept door.\nThe Grand Organ was completed in 1872, and the Panopticon Organ moved to the Victoria Rooms in Clifton in 1873.\nThe Grand Organ is the fifth-largest in Great Britain, in terms of number of pipes (7,256), with 5 manuals, 136 ranks of pipes and 137 stops, principally enclosed in an impressive case designed in Wren's workshop and decorated by Grinling Gibbons.\nDetails of the organ can be found online at the National Pipe Organ Register.\n\n\n=== Choir ===\nSt Paul's Cathedral has a full professional choir, which sings regularly at services. The earliest records of the choir date from 1127. The choir historically consisted of up to 30 boy choristers, eight probationers and vicars choral of 12 professional male singers.\nIn February 2017 the cathedral announced the appointment of the first female vicar choral, Carris Jones (a mezzo-soprano), to take up the role in September 2017.\nDuring 2022, St Paulâs Cathedral announced that it would admit girls to its choir, breaking a tradition stretching back 900 years. On 30 June 2024, when two girls formally joined the Cathedral Choir as full choristers, having undertaken specialist training in preparation, the Sunday Choral Evensong service officially marked this historic event.\nDuring school terms the choir sings Evensong six times per week, the service on Mondays being sung by a visiting choir (or occasionally said) and that on Thursdays being sung by the vicars choral alone. On Sundays the choir also sings at Mattins and the 11:30 am Eucharist.\nMany distinguished musicians have been organists, choir masters and choristers at St Paul's Cathedral, including the composers John Redford, Thomas Morley, John Blow, Jeremiah Clarke, Maurice Greene and John Stainer, while well-known performers have included Alfred Deller, John Shirley-Quirk and Anthony Way as well as the conductors Charles Groves and Paul Hillier and the poet Walter de la Mare.\n\n\n== Wren's cathedral ==\n\n\n=== Development of the design ===\n\nIn designing St Paul's, Christopher Wren had to meet many challenges. He had to create a fitting cathedral to replace Old St Paul's, as a place of worship and as a landmark within the City of London. He had to satisfy the requirements of the church and the tastes of a royal patron, as well as respecting the essentially medieval tradition of English church building which developed to accommodate the liturgy. Wren was familiar with contemporary Renaissance and Baroque trends in Italian architecture and had visited France, where he studied the work of FranÃ§ois Mansart.\nWren's design developed through five general stages. The first survives only as a single drawing and part of a model. The scheme (usually called the First Model Design) appears to have consisted of a circular domed vestibule (possibly based on the Pantheon in Rome) and a rectangular church of basilica form. The plan may have been influenced by the Temple Church. It was rejected because it was not thought \"stately enough\". Wren's second design was a Greek cross, which was thought by the clerics not to fulfil the requirements of Anglican liturgy.\nWren's third design is embodied in the \"Great Model\" of 1673. The model, made of oak and plaster, cost over Â£500 (approximately Â£32,000 today) and is over 13 feet (4 m) tall and 21 feet (6 m) long. This design retained the form of the Greek-Cross design but extended it with a nave. His critics, members of a committee commissioned to rebuild the church, and clergy decried the design as too dissimilar to other English churches to suggest any continuity within the Church of England. Another problem was that the entire design would have to be completed all at once because of the eight central piers that supported the dome, instead of being completed in stages and opened for use before construction finished, as was customary. The Great Model was Wren's favourite design; he thought it a reflection of Renaissance beauty. After the Great Model, Wren resolved not to make further models and not to expose his drawings publicly, which he found did nothing but \"lose time, and subject [his] business many times, to incompetent judges\". The Great Model survives and is housed within the cathedral itself.\nWren's fourth design is known as the Warrant design because it received a Royal warrant for the rebuilding. In this design Wren sought to reconcile Gothic, the predominant style of English churches, to a \"better manner of architecture\". It has the longitudinal Latin Cross plan of a medieval cathedral. It is of 1+1â2 storeys and has classical porticos at the west and transept ends, influenced by Inigo Jones's addition to Old St Paul's. It is roofed at the crossing by a wide shallow dome supporting a drum with a second cupola, from which rises a spire of seven diminishing stages. Vaughan Hart has suggested that influence in the design of the spire may have been drawn from the oriental pagoda. Not used at St Paul's, the concept was applied in the spire of St Bride's, Fleet Street. This plan was rotated slightly on its site so that it aligned, not with true east, but with sunrise on Easter of the year construction began. This small change in configuration was informed by Wren's knowledge of astronomy.\n\n\n=== Final design ===\nThe final design as built differs substantially from the official Warrant design. Wren received permission from the king to make \"ornamental changes\" to the submitted design, and Wren took great advantage of this. Many of these changes were made over the course of the thirty years as the church was constructed, and the most significant was to the dome: \"He raised another structure over the first cupola, a cone of brick, so as to support a stone lantern of an elegant figure ... And he covered and hid out of sight the brick cone with another cupola of timber and lead; and between this and the cone are easy stairs that ascend to the lantern\" (Christopher Wren, son of Sir Christopher Wren). The final design was strongly rooted in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. The saucer domes over the nave were inspired by FranÃ§ois Mansart's Church of the Val-de-GrÃ¢ce, which Wren had seen during a trip to Paris in 1665.\nThe date of the laying of the first stone of the cathedral is disputed. One contemporary account says it was 21 June 1675, another 25 June and a third on 28 June. There is, however, general agreement that it was laid in June 1675. Edward Strong later claimed it was laid by his elder brother, Thomas Strong, one of the two master stonemasons appointed by Wren at the beginning of the work.\n\n\n=== Structural engineering ===\n\nWren's challenge was to construct a large cathedral on the relatively weak clay soil of London. St Paul's is unusual among cathedrals in that there is a crypt, the largest in Europe, under the entire building rather than just under the eastern end. The crypt serves a structural purpose. Although it is extensive, half the space of the crypt is taken up by massive piers which spread the weight of the much slimmer piers of the church above. While the towers and domes of most cathedrals are supported on four piers, Wren designed the dome of St Paul's to be supported on eight, achieving a broader distribution of weight at the level of the foundations. The foundations settled as the building progressed, and Wren made structural changes in response.\nOne of the design problems that confronted Wren was to create a landmark dome, tall enough to visually replace the lost tower of St Paul's, while at the same time appearing visually satisfying when viewed from inside the building. Wren planned a double-shelled dome, as at St Peter's Basilica. His solution to the visual problem was to separate the heights of the inner and outer dome to a much greater extent than had been done by Michelangelo at St Peter's, drafting both as catenary curves, rather than as hemispheres. Between the inner and outer domes, Wren inserted a brick cone which supports both the timbers of the outer, lead-covered dome and the weight of the ornate stone lantern that rises above it. Both the cone and the inner dome are 18 inches thick and are supported by wrought iron chains at intervals in the brick cone and around the cornice of the peristyle of the inner dome to prevent spreading and cracking.\nThe Warrant Design showed external buttresses on the ground floor level. These were not a classical feature and were one of the first elements Wren changed. Instead he made the walls of the cathedral particularly thick to avoid the need for external buttresses altogether. The clerestory and vault are reinforced with flying buttresses, which were added at a relatively late stage in the design to give extra strength. These are concealed behind the screen wall of the upper story, which was added to keep the building's classical style intact, to add sufficient visual mass to balance the appearance of the dome and which, by its weight, counters the thrust of the buttresses on the lower walls.\n\n\n=== Designers, builders and craftsmen ===\nDuring the extensive period of design and rationalisation, Wren employed from 1684 Nicholas Hawksmoor as his principal assistant. Between 1696 and 1711 William Dickinson was measuring clerk. Joshua Marshall (until his early death in 1678) and Thomas and his brother Edward Strong were master masons, the latter two working on the construction for its entirety. John Langland was the master carpenter for over thirty years. Grinling Gibbons was the chief sculptor, working in both stone on the building itself, including the pediment of the north portal, and wood on the internal fittings. The sculptor Caius Gabriel Cibber created the pediment of the south transept while Francis Bird was responsible for the relief in the west pediment depicting the Conversion of St Paul, as well as the seven large statues on the west front. The floor was paved by William Dickinson in black and white marble in 1709â10 Jean Tijou was responsible for the decorative wrought ironwork of gates and balustrades. The ball and cross on the dome were provided by an armorer, Andrew Niblett. Following the war damage mentioned above, many craftsmen were employed to restore the wood carvings and stone work that had been destroyed by the bomb impact. One of particular note is Master Carver, Gino Masero who was commissioned to carve the replacement figure of Christ, an eight-foot sculpture in lime which currently stands on the High Altar.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nSt Paul's Cathedral is built in a restrained Baroque style which represents Wren's rationalisation of the traditions of English medieval cathedrals with the inspiration of Palladio, the classical style of Inigo Jones, the baroque style of 17th century Rome, and the buildings by Mansart and others that he had seen in France. It is particularly in its plan that St Paul's reveals medieval influences. Like the great medieval cathedrals of York and Winchester, St Paul's is comparatively long for its width, and has strongly projecting transepts. It has much emphasis on its facade, which has been designed to define rather than conceal the form of the building behind it. In plan, the towers jut beyond the width of the aisles as they do at Wells Cathedral. Wren's uncle Matthew Wren was the Bishop of Ely, and, having worked for his uncle, Wren was familiar with the unique octagonal lantern tower over the crossing of Ely Cathedral, which spans the aisles as well as the central nave, unlike the central towers and domes of most churches. Wren adapted this characteristic in designing the dome of St Paul's. In section St Paul's also maintains a medieval form, having the aisles much lower than the nave, and a defined clerestory.\n\n\n=== Exterior ===\nThe most renowned exterior feature is the dome, which rises 365 feet (111 m) to the cross at its summit, and dominates views of the city. The height of 365 feet is explained by Wren's interest in astronomy. Until the late 20th century St Paul's was the tallest building on the City skyline, designed to be seen surrounded by the delicate spires of Wren's other city churches. The dome is described by Sir Banister Fletcher as \"probably the finest in Europe\", by Helen Gardner as \"majestic\", and by Sir Nikolaus Pevsner as \"one of the most perfect in the world\". Sir John Summerson said that Englishmen and \"even some foreigners\" consider it to be without equal.\n\n\n==== Dome ====\n\nWren drew inspiration from Michelangelo's dome of St Peter's Basilica, and that of Mansart's Church of the Val-de-GrÃ¢ce, which he had visited. Unlike those of St Peter's and Val-de-GrÃ¢ce, the dome of St Paul's rises in two clearly defined storeys of masonry, which, together with a lower unadorned footing, equal a height of about 95 feet. From the time of the Greek Cross Design it is clear that Wren favoured a continuous colonnade (peristyle) around the drum of the dome, rather than the arrangement of alternating windows and projecting columns that Michelangelo had used and which had also been employed by Mansart. Summerson suggests that he was influenced by Bramante's \"Tempietto\" in the courtyard of San Pietro in Montorio. In the finished structure, Wren creates a diversity and appearance of strength by placing niches between the columns in every fourth opening. The peristyle serves to buttress both the inner dome and the brick cone which rises internally to support the lantern.\nAbove the peristyle rises the second stage surrounded by a balustraded balcony called the \"Stone Gallery\". This attic stage is ornamented with alternating pilasters and rectangular windows which are set just below the cornice, creating a sense of lightness. Above this attic rises the dome, covered with lead, and ribbed in accordance with the spacing of the pilasters. It is pierced by eight light wells just below the lantern, but these are barely visible. They allow light to penetrate through openings in the brick cone, which illuminates the interior apex of this shell, partly visible from within the cathedral through the ocular opening of the lower dome.\nThe lantern, like the visible masonry of the dome, rises in stages. The most unusual characteristic of this structure is that it is of square plan, rather than circular or octagonal. The tallest stage takes the form of a tempietto with four columned porticos facing the cardinal points. Its lowest level is surrounded by the \"Golden Gallery\" and its upper level supports a small dome from which rises a cross on a golden ball. The total weight of the lantern is about 850 tons.\n\n\n==== West front ====\n\nFor the Renaissance architect designing the west front of a large church or cathedral, the universal problem was how to use a facade to unite the high central nave with the lower aisles in a visually harmonious whole. Since Alberti's additions to Santa Maria Novella in Florence, this was usually achieved by the simple expedient of linking the sides to the centre with large brackets. This is the solution that Wren saw employed by Mansart at Val-de-GrÃ¢ce. Another feature employed by Mansart was a boldly projecting Classical portico with paired columns. Wren faced the additional challenge of incorporating towers into the design, as had been planned at St Peter's Basilica. At St Peter's, Carlo Maderno had solved this problem by constructing a narthex and stretching a huge screen facade across it, differentiated at the centre by a pediment. The towers at St Peter's were not built above the parapet.\nWren's solution was to employ a Classical portico, as at Val-de-GrÃ¢ce, but rising through two storeys, and supported on paired columns. The remarkable feature here is that the lower story of this portico extends to the full width of the aisles, while the upper section defines the nave that lies behind it. The gaps between the upper stage of the portico and the towers on either side are bridged by a narrow section of wall with an arch-topped window.\nThe towers stand outside the width of the aisles, but screen two chapels located immediately behind them. The lower parts of the towers continue the theme of the outer walls, but are differentiated from them in order to create an appearance of strength. The windows of the lower story are smaller than those of the side walls and are deeply recessed, a visual indication of the thickness of the wall. The paired pilasters at each corner project boldly.\nAbove the main cornice, which unites the towers with the portico and the outer walls, the details are boldly scaled, in order to read well from the street below and from a distance. The towers rise above the cornice from a square block plinth which is plain apart from large oculi, that on the south being filled by the clock, while that on the north is void. The towers are composed of two complementary elements, a central cylinder rising through the tiers in a series of stacked drums, and paired Corinthian columns at the corners, with buttresses above them, which serve to unify the drum shape with the square plinth on which it stands. The entablature above the columns breaks forward over them to express both elements, tying them together in a single horizontal band. The cap, an ogee-shaped dome, supports a gilded finial in the form of a pineapple.\nThe transepts each have a semi-circular entrance portico. Wren was inspired in the design by studying engravings of Pietro da Cortona's Baroque facade of Santa Maria della Pace in Rome. These projecting arcs echo the shape of the apse at the eastern end of the building.\n\n\n==== Walls ====\nThe building is of two storeys of ashlar masonry, above a basement, and surrounded by a balustrade above the upper cornice. The balustrade was added, against Wren's wishes, in 1718. The internal bays are marked externally by paired pilasters with Corinthian capitals at the lower level and Composite at the upper level. Where the building behind is of only one story (at the aisles of both nave and choir) the upper story of the exterior wall is sham. It serves a dual purpose of supporting the buttresses of the vault, and providing a satisfying appearance when viewed rising above buildings of the height of the 17th-century city. This appearance may still be seen from across the River Thames.\nBetween the pilasters on both levels are windows. Those of the lower storey have semi-circular heads and are surrounded by continuous mouldings of a Roman style, rising to decorative keystones. Beneath each window is a floral swag by Grinling Gibbons, constituting the finest stone carving on the building and some of the greatest architectural sculpture in England. A frieze with similar swags runs in a band below the cornice, tying the arches of the windows and the capitals. The upper windows are of a restrained Classical form, with pediments set on columns, but are blind and contain niches. Beneath these niches, and in the basement level, are small windows with segmental tops, the glazing of which catches the light and visually links them to the large windows of the aisles. The height from ground level to the top of the parapet is approximately 110 feet.\n\n\n==== Fencing ====\nThe original fencing, designed by Wren, was dismantled in the 1870s. The surveyor for the government of Toronto had it shipped to Toronto, where it has since adorned High Park.\n\n\n=== Interior ===\n\nInternally, St Paul's has a nave and choir in each of its three bays. The entrance from the west portico is through a square domed narthex, flanked by chapels: the Chapel of St Dunstan to the north and the Chapel of the Order of St Michael and St George to the south. The nave is 91 feet (28 m) in height and is separated from the aisles by an arcade of piers with attached Corinthian pilasters rising to an entablature. The bays, and therefore the vault compartments, are rectangular, but Wren roofed these spaces with saucer-shaped domes and surrounded the clerestory windows with lunettes. The vaults of the choir are decorated with mosaics by Sir William Blake Richmond. The dome and the apse of the choir are all approached through wide arches with coffered vaults which contrast with the smooth surface of the domes and punctuate the division between the main spaces. The transepts extend to the north and south of the dome and are called (in this instance) the North Choir and the South Choir.\nThe choir holds the stalls for the clergy, cathedral officers and the choir, and the organ. These wooden fittings, including the pulpit and Bishop's throne, were designed in Wren's office and built by joiners. The carvings are the work of Grinling Gibbons whom Summerson describes as having \"astonishing facility\", suggesting that Gibbons aim was to reproduce popular Dutch flower painting in wood. Jean Tijou, a French metalworker, provided various wrought iron and gilt grilles, gates and balustrades of elaborate design, of which many pieces have now been combined into the gates near the sanctuary.\nThe cathedral is some 574 feet (175 m) in length (including the portico of the Great West Door), of which 223 feet (68 m) is the nave and 167 feet (51 m) is the choir.\nThe width of the nave is 121 feet (37 m) and across the transepts is 246 feet (75 m). The cathedral is slightly shorter but somewhat wider than Old St Paul's.\n\n\n==== Dome ====\n\nThe main internal space of the cathedral is that under the central dome which extends the full width of the nave and aisles. The dome is supported on pendentives rising between eight arches spanning the nave, choir, transepts, and aisles. The eight piers that carry them are not evenly spaced. Wren has maintained an appearance of eight equal spans by inserting segmental arches to carry galleries across the ends of the aisles, and has extended the mouldings of the upper arch to appear equal to the wider arches.\nAbove the keystones of the arches, at 99 feet (30 m) above the floor and 112 feet (34 m) wide, runs a cornice which supports the Whispering Gallery so called because of its acoustic properties: a whisper or low murmur against its wall at any point is audible to a listener with an ear held to the wall at any other point around the gallery. It is reached by 259 steps from ground level.\nThe dome is raised on a tall drum surrounded by pilasters and pierced with windows in groups of three, separated by eight gilded niches containing statues, and repeating the pattern of the peristyle on the exterior. The dome rises above a gilded cornice at 173 feet (53 m) to a height of 214 feet (65 m). Its painted decoration by Sir James Thornhill shows eight scenes from the life of St Paul set in illusionistic architecture which continues the forms of the eight niches of the drum. At the apex of the dome is an oculus inspired by that of the Pantheon in Rome. Through this hole can be seen the decorated inner surface of the cone which supports the lantern. This upper space is lit by the light wells in the outer dome and openings in the brick cone. Engravings of Thornhill's paintings were published in 1720.\n\n\n==== Apse ====\n\nThe eastern apse extends the width of the choir and is the full height of the main arches across choir and nave. It is decorated with mosaics, in keeping with the choir vaults. The original reredos and high altar were destroyed by bombing in 1940. The present high altar and baldacchino are the work of W. Godfrey Allen and Stephen Dykes Bower. The apse was dedicated in 1958 as the American Memorial Chapel. It was paid for entirely by donations from British people. The Roll of Honour contains the names of more than 28,000 Americans who gave their lives while on their way to, or stationed in, the United Kingdom during the Second World War. It is in front of the chapel's altar. The three windows of the apse date from 1960 and depict themes of service and sacrifice, while the insignia around the edges represent the American states and the US armed forces. The limewood panelling incorporates a rocketâa tribute to America's achievements in space.\n\n\n=== Artworks, tombs and memorials ===\nSt Paul's, at the time of its completion, was adorned by sculpture in stone and wood: most notably that of Grinling Gibbons, by the paintings in the dome by Thornhill, and by Jean Tijou's elaborate metalwork. It has been further enhanced by Sir William Richmond's mosaics and the fittings by Dykes Bower and Godfrey Allen. Other artworks in the cathedral include, in the south aisle, William Holman Hunt's copy of his painting The Light of the World, the original of which hangs in Keble College, Oxford. The St. Paul's version was completed with a significant input from Edward Robert Hughes as Hunt was now suffering from glaucoma. In the north choir aisle is a limestone sculpture of the Madonna and Child by Henry Moore, carved in 1943. The crypt contains over 200 memorials and numerous burials. Christopher Wren was the first person to be interred, in 1723. On the wall above his tomb in the crypt is written in Latin: Lector, si monumentum requiris, circumspice (\"Reader, if you seek his monument, look around you\").\n\nThe largest monument in the cathedral is that to the Duke of Wellington by Alfred Stevens. It stands on the north side of the nave and has on top a statue of Wellington astride his horse \"Copenhagen\". Although the equestrian figure was planned at the outset, objections to the notion of having a horse in the church prevented its installation until 1912. The horse and rider are by John Tweed. The Duke is buried in the crypt.\nThe tomb of Horatio, Lord Nelson is located in the crypt, next to that of Wellington. The marble sarcophagus which holds Nelson's remains was made for Cardinal Wolsey but not used as the cardinal had fallen from favour. At the eastern end of the crypt is the Chapel of the Order of the British Empire, instigated in 1917, and designed by John Seely, Lord Mottistone. There are many other memorials commemorating the British military, including several lists of servicemen who died in action, the most recent being the Gulf War.\nAlso remembered are Florence Nightingale, J. M. W. Turner, Arthur Sullivan, Hubert Parry, Samuel Johnson, Lawrence of Arabia, William Blake, William Jones and Sir Alexander Fleming as well as clergy and residents of the local parish. There are lists of the Bishops and cathedral Deans for the last thousand years. One of the most remarkable sculptures is that of the Dean and poet, John Donne. Before his death, Donne posed for his own memorial statue and was depicted by Nicholas Stone as wrapped in a burial shroud, and standing on a funeral urn. The sculpture, carved around 1630, is the only one to have survived the conflagration of 1666 intact. The treasury is also in the crypt but the cathedral has very few treasures as many have been lost, and on 22 December 1810 a major robbery took almost all of the remaining precious artefacts.\nThe funerals of many notable figures have been held in the cathedral, including those of Lord Nelson, the Duke of Wellington, Winston Churchill, George Mallory and Margaret Thatcher.\nThe East India Company Trail at St. Paul's Cathedral\nIn 2023, following nationwide discussions over the status and value of memorial statues celebrating the lives of individuals involved with the British Empire, including slavery, the St. Paul's Cathedral initiated a partnership with Stepney Community Trust, a community-led charity based out of the East End of London. A group of volunteers were recruited to help historically situated the many memorial statues inside St. Paul's Cathedral, whose careers, actions and views were associated with historic harm done to communities in South Asia. The project entailed writing explanatory texts that situated the highly eulogistic statues in their wider historical context. These texts are now available on the website of St. Paul's Cathedral, on dedicated webpages titled The East India Company at St. Paul's.\nMemorials thus contextualised include the statue of Charles George Gordon, the statue of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, the statue of Richard Southwell Bourke, 6th Earl of Mayo, the statue of Bishop Thomas Fanshaw Middleton, the statue of Granville Gower Loch, the statue of William Jones, the statue of Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis, the statue of Henry Montgomery Lawrence, the statue of Henry Bartle Frere, the statue of Robert Cornelius Napier, 1st Baron Napier of Magdala, the statue of Charles James Napier, the statue of Charles Metcalfe Macgregor, the statue of Samuel James Browne, the statue of Harry Smith Parkes and the memorial to Indian Army Volunteers. The trail has a printed guide that visitors may use, and the statues on the trail are identifiable by a graphic and a QR code which leads to the relevant webpage upon scanning. The graphic is original artwork produced by graphic design artist Sonal Agarwal, and represents a cluster of statues of South Asian persons, men and women, who currently serve as decorative or supportive features of the main statues. \n\n\n=== Clock ===\n\nA clock was installed in the south-west tower by Langley Bradley in 1709 but was worn out by the end of the 19th century. The present mechanism was built in 1893 by Smith of Derby incorporating a design of escapement by Edmund Denison Beckett similar to that used by Edward Dent on Big Ben's mechanism in 1895. The clock mechanism is 19 feet (5.8 m) long and is the most recent of the clocks introduced to St Paul's Cathedral over the centuries. Since 1969 the clock has been electrically wound with equipment designed and installed by Smith of Derby, relieving the clock custodian from the work of cranking up the heavy drive weights.\n\n\n==== Great Paul ====\n\nThe south-west tower also contains four bells, of which Great Paul, cast in 1881 by J. W. Taylor of Taylor's bell foundry of Loughborough, at 16+1â2 long tons (16,800 kg) was the largest bell in the British Isles until the casting of the Olympic Bell for the 2012 London Olympics. Although the bell is traditionally sounded at 1 pm each day, Great Paul had not been rung for several years because of a broken chiming mechanism. In the 1970s the fastening mechanism that secured the clapper had fractured, sending both through the clock mechanism below and causing damage which cost Â£30,000 to repair. In about 1989 the clapper fractured completely, although less damage was sustained. On 31 July 2021, during the London Festival of the Bells, Great Paul rang for the first time in two decades, being hand swung by the bell ringers.\n\n\n==== Great Tom ====\nThe clock bells include Great Tom, which was moved from St Stephen's Chapel at the Palace of Westminster and has been recast several times, the last time by Richard Phelps. It chimes the hour and is traditionally tolled on occasions of a death in the royal family, the Bishop of London, or the Lord Mayor of London, although an exception was made at the death of the US president James Garfield. It was last tolled for the death of Queen Elizabeth II in 2022, ringing once every minute along with other bells across the country in honour of the 96 years of her life.\n\n\n==== Quarter-jacks ====\nIn 1717, Richard Phelps cast two more bells that were added as \"quarter jacks\" that ring on the quarter hour. Still in use today, the first weighs 13 long cwt (1,500 lb; 660 kg), is 41 inches (100 cm) in diameter and is tuned to Aâ­; the second weighs 35 long cwt (3,900 lb; 1,800 kg), is 58 inches (150 cm) in diameter and is tuned to Eâ­. They are sometimes known as Ding and Dong due to the way they sound.\n\n\n=== Bells ===\nThe north-west tower contains 13 bells. A ring of 12 bells by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough hung for change ringing, and the single communion bell. In January 2018 the bells were removed for refurbishment and were rehung in September that year, being rung again for the first time on All Saints' Day. The original service or \"Communion\" bell dating from 1700 and known as \"the Banger\" is rung before 8 a.m. services.\n\n\n== Education, tourism and the arts ==\n\n\n=== Interpretation Project ===\nThe Interpretation Project was a long-term project concerned with bringing St Paul's to life for all its visitors. In 2010, the Dean and Chapter of St Paul's opened St Paul's Oculus, a 270Â° film experience that brings 1400 years of history to life. It was located in the former Treasury in the crypt, the film took visitors on a journey through the history and daily life of St Paul's Cathedral. Oculus was funded by American Express Company in partnership with the World Monuments Fund, J. P. Morgan, the Garfield Weston Trust for St Paul's Cathedral, the City of London Endowment Trust and AIG. It was closed by 2020. The Treasury space is now used for changing exhibitions.\nIn 2010, touchscreen multimedia guides were launched. These guides are included in the price of admission. Visitors can discover the cathedral's history, architecture and daily life of a busy working church with these new multimedia guides. They are available in 12 different languages: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, Russian, Mandarin, Japanese, Korean and British Sign Language (BSL). The guides have fly-through videos of the dome galleries and zoomable close-ups of the ceiling mosaics, painting and photography. Interviews and commentary from experts include the Dean of St Paul's, conservation team and the Director of Music. Archive film footage includes major services and events from the cathedral's history.\n\n\n==== Charges for sightseers ====\nSt Paul's charges an entrance fee for sightseers, admission to worship services is free. The entrance ticket is Â£25 for adults (June 2024). Outside service times, people seeking a quiet place to pray or worship are admitted to St Dunstan's Chapel free of charge. On Sundays people are admitted only for services and concerts and there is no sightseeing. The charge to sightseers is made because St Paul's receives little regular or significant funding from the Crown, the Church of England or the state and relies on the income generated by tourism to allow the building to continue to function as a centre for Christian worship, as well as to cover general maintenance and repair work.\n\n\n=== St Paul's Cathedral Arts Project ===\nThe St Paul's Cathedral Arts Project explores art and faith. Projects have included installations by Gerry Judah, Antony Gormley, Rebecca Horn, Yoko Ono and Martin Firrell.\nIn 2014, St Paul's commissioned Gerry Judah to create an artwork in the nave to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the beginning of the First World War. Two spectacular sculptures consisting of three-dimensional white cruciforms reflect the meticulously maintained war graves of northern France and further afield. Each sculpture is also embellished with miniaturised destroyed residential blocks depicting contemporary war zones in the Middle EastâSyria, Baghdad, Afghanistanâthus connecting 100 years of warfare.\nBill Viola has created two altarpieces for permanent display in St Paul's Cathedral. The project commenced production in mid-2009. Following the extensive programme of cleaning and repair of the interior of St Paul's, completed in 2005, Viola was commissioned to create two altarpieces on the themes of Mary and Martyrs. These two multi-screen video installations are permanently located at the end of the Quire aisles, flanking the High Altar of the cathedral and the American Memorial Chapel. Each work employs an arrangement of multiple plasma screen panels configured in a manner similar to historic altarpieces.\nIn summer 2010, St Paul's chose two new works by the British artist Mark Alexander to be hung either side of the nave. Both entitled Red Mannheim, Alexander's large red silkscreens are inspired by the Mannheim Cathedral altarpiece (1739â41), which was damaged by bombing in the Second World War. The original sculpture depicts Christ on the cross, surrounded by a familiar retinue of mourners. Rendered in splendid giltwood, with Christ's wracked body sculpted in relief, and the flourishes of flora and incandescent rays from heaven, this masterpiece of the German Rococo is an object of ravishing beauty and intense piety.\nIn March 2010, Flare II, a sculpture by Antony Gormley, was installed in the Geometric Staircase.\nIn 2007, the Dean and Chapter commissioned Martin Firrell to create a major public artwork to mark the 300th anniversary of the topping-out of Wren's building. The Question Mark Inside consisted of digital text projections to the cathedral dome, West Front and inside onto the Whispering Gallery. The text was based on blog contributions by the general public as well as interviews conducted by the artist and on the artist's own views. The project presented a stream of possible answers to the question: \"What makes life meaningful and purposeful, and what does St Paul's mean in that contemporary context?\" The Question Mark Inside opened on 8 November 2008 and ran for eight nights.\n\n\n=== Depictions of St Paul's ===\nSt Paul's Cathedral has been depicted many times in paintings, prints and drawings. Among the well-known artists to have painted it are Canaletto, Turner, Daubigny, Pissarro, Signac, Derain, and Lloyd Rees.\n\n\tPaintings and engravings of St Paul's\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Photography and film ====\nSt Paul's Cathedral has been the subject of many photographs, most notably the iconic image of the dome surrounded by smoke during the Blitz.(see above) It has also been used in films and TV programmes (including Thames Television's most recognised ident), either as the focus of the film, as in the episode of Climbing Great Buildings; as a feature of the film, as in Mary Poppins; or as an incidental location such as Wren's Geometric Staircase in the south-west tower which has appeared in several films including Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.\nFilms in which St Paul's has been depicted include:\n\nSt. Paul's Cathedral (1942), a wartime documentary film for the British Council, the final part of which shows bomb damage in and around St Paul's.\nLawrence of Arabia (1962) shows the exterior of the building and the bust of T.E. Lawrence.\nMary Poppins (1964) shows the steps and west front of the cathedral, the main setting for the song '\"Feed the Birds'\".\nSt Paul's Cathedral has appeared as a filming location twice in Doctor Who, in the 1968 serial The Invasion, and in the 2014 two-part story \"Dark Water\"/\"Death in Heaven\". In both, the Cybermen are shown descending steps outside the cathedral.\nSt Paul's is seen briefly in the Goodies episode \"Kitten Kong\" (1971). During his rampage through London, Twinkle damages London landmarks, including St Paul's Cathedral, the dome of which is knocked off.\nIn the BBC educational programme \"A Guide to Armageddon\" (1982), a one-megaton nuclear weapon is detonated over London, with St Paul's used as ground zero.\nLifeforce (1985): The cathedral's interior is the setting for the climax of the film.\nThe Madness of King George (1994) shows the Geometric Staircase in the South West Bell Tower.\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) shows the Geometric Staircase in the south west bell tower, representing the staircase towards the Divination classroom.\nStar Trek Into Darkness (2013) depicts St Paul's in 23rd century London along with other notable modern-day London buildings.\nSt Paul's is the only building of ancient London that survived the \"Sixty Minute War\" in the movie Mortal Engines (2018) and the books it is based on.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nCategory:Burials at St Paul's Cathedral\nHistory of early modern period domes\nList of cathedrals in the United Kingdom\nList of churches and cathedrals of London\nList of tallest domes\nList of tallest structures built before the 20th century\nMagnificat and Nunc dimittis for St Paul's Cathedral\nPaternoster Square\nCyril Raikes (fire watching on the dome of St Paul's Cathedral in the Second World War)\nTall buildings in London\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nBarker, Felix; Hyde, Ralph (1982), London as it might have been, John Murray\nBede (1910).

Reinforced concrete, the central bays a prototype of the egg-crate or box-frame construction that revolutionised the design of flats after the Second World War, with monolithic construction to either side - reflecting the different plan forms of the maisonettes within.  Cladding of faience with inset brick panels to centre reflects the structure, marble cladding to entrance; flat roof with curved roof to penthouse.  Six storeys.  Large cantilevered canopy to front, partly resting on two casts of Erectheion caryatids obtained from the British Museum and intended by Lubetkin `to be read not as part of the building but as a garden ornament'.  Square paned windows to entrance foyer, and bronzed doors; metal windows with mullions forming regular rectangular openings to all flats, glazed bricks to service stairs.  Rear aviary. INTERIOR.  Central six four-bedroomed maisonettes, with double height living rooms and an oval stair giving on to open landing.  Double-height living rooms were a feature of luxury modern flats at this time, for instance the particularly complex planning of No.10 Palace Gate by Wells Coates.  Maisonettes at either end with four bedrooms intended for larger families.  Separate lifts and stairs for tradesmen and servants.  Suites of maids' rooms on the ground floor.  The main entrance leads under canopy to boomerang-shaped foyer, with curved travertine ramps on either side leading to lifts, which open directly into the flats.  Conoid metal wall-lights a distinctive feature.  On top, penthouse flat was originally Lubetkin's own London home.  Two bedrooms, two bathrooms and large living room under curved roof which suggests a symmetrical plan below that is in fact disturbed by axial lines placed off-centre below, with concealed light sources within and to inglenook fireplace.  Large fully-opening windows on to terrace, with built in marble seat within.  Tiled floors throughout, while the entrance lobby and living room are lined in thick sand-blasted Norwegian pine panelling, likened to an early form of brise soleil or to a Russia dacha.  John Allan has written that  more even than the cayatids, this interior cameo of a world both modern and filled with history seems to support Colin Rowe's thesis of another tradition of Modernity, in contraddistinction to the supposed minline of Gropius, Meyer, Marinetti; a counter-formulation represented by such as Stravinsky, Joydce, Picasso, Eliot and Proust that embraces metaphor, irony and multiple meaning (p.303).  Le Corbusier's own penthouse at the Porte Molitor in Paris may also have been an inspiration.\nHighpoint Two is remarkable in that it advances the imagery of modernism beyond that of the classic white concrete box found next door at Highpoint One.  It is at once luxurious and rich in its materials, while anticipating the use of box framing with brick and tile infil that Lubetkin, Tecton and others were to employ in low-cost housing after the war.  The caryatids also anticipate the ironical historical statements of recent post-modernists.  When it was completed critical reaction to the building was hostile, as young architectural students seeing Lubetkin as the master of modernism in England could not understand how he had progressed beyond the confines of the international style.  Now it can be appreciated as perhaps the more revolutionary of the two Highpoint blocks.\nSources\nPeter Coe and Malcolm Reading, Lubetkin and Tecton, Architecture and Social Commitment, Bristol, Arts Council, 1981, pp.120-4, 152-8\nJohn Allan, Berthold Lubetkin, Architecture and the Tradition of Progress, London, RIBA, 1992, pp.252-312 \nListing NGR: TQ2826987801\n        \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n    \n        Legacy\n    \n    \n        The contents of this record have been generated from a legacy data system.\n    \n    \n        \n            Legacy System number:\n            \n                201443\n            \n        \n        \n            Legacy System:\n            \n                LBS\n            \n        \n    \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n                    Sources\n                \n                \n                    Books and journalsAllan,  J, Berthold Lubetkin Architecture and the Tradition of Progress, (2012), 252-312Coe,  P, Reading,  M, Lubetkin and Tecton Architecture and Social Commitment, (1981), 120-124\n                \n\n\n\n                    \n                        \n\n\n    \n        Legal\n    \n\n\n    \n        This building is listed under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as amended for its special architectural or historic interest.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n\n            \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n            \n                Map\n            \n            \n                This map is for quick reference purposes only and may not be to scale.

    "wikipediaText": "Cromwell House is a Grade I listed building built in 1638 in Highgate Village, now a suburb of London.  It is currently owned by the Republic of Ghana and used as its visa section.\n\n\n== The builder of the house ==\nCromwell House was commissioned by Sir Richard Sprignell, who was born about 1603, the eldest son of Robert Sprignell, Esquire (1560â1624) and Susan Daniell, and was educated at Brasenose College, Oxford, where he matriculated in January 1620 aged seventeen and graduated BA in February 1622. On the death of his parents in 1627, Sprignell inherited some houses in Whitefriars Street, two manors in Essex, Great and Little Maldon, and one in Yorkshire, Copmanthorpe, and some property in Middlesex, described as \"dwelling house, yards, backsides, gardens, Palefield and four other fields adjoining ... in the parish of Harringay alias Hornsey\". In 1634, Sprignell was commissioned as a Captain of Train-Bands and in 1639 became a governor of Highgate grammar school. In 1641, Charles I created him a Baronet.\nSprignell married firstly Anne Delaune, whose father, Gideon Delaune, was the apothecary to Queen Anne, wife of James I. Sometimes called the founder the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries, Sprignell was by far its most important member. Although he was a foreign national, at the urging of Charles I he was granted the freedom of the City of London. In 1628 he became Master of the Apothecaries in a contested election and was elected again in 1636. He married secondly Judith Chamberlaine of London, whose father was Henry Chamberlaine, and together they had at least seventeen children.\n\n\n== Architecture and history ==\nThe identity of the original architect of Cromwell House remains unknown, but it is certainly a tour-de-force on the part of a highly skilled brick-layer/contractor. Built in 1637â38, it infers the influence of Inigo Jones in the regularity of its seven-window frontage. It is recognised as one of the finest examples, along with Kew Palace, of the 17th-century \"artisan mannerist\" style of domestic architecture in London to have survived virtually intact. Behind the elaborately carved red-brick facade, it has an oak staircase of national importance, the design of which may have been influenced by that at Blickling Hall, built twenty years earlier, the country house of Sir Henry Hobart, whose other home was Lauderdale House, which directly faces Cromwell House on the other side of Highgate Hill. Sir Richard commissioned wooden carvings of military figures of the Stuart period to stand on each newel post of the staircase; and in 1639, when he obtained his grant of arms, he had them incorporated into the centre of the elaborate plaster ceiling of the principal room. In 1678â79, the da Costa family built a new wing to the north of the house and added the carriageway entrance to the south, with two rooms above it, one of which has the da Costa crest on a fine fireplace surround. During its period as a school in the mid-19th century, a gabled rear extension was added for use as a dining hall, and in 1865 a serious fire destroyed the roof, the old dome, and the second floor. In the 20th century, a large rear wing was constructed on the north-east side, which is now used as offices. In 1951 the building was listed Grade I, a category reserved for buildings of exceptional interest.\n\nSadly, while the house stood empty in the 1980s a number of architectural antiques were stolen from it, including most of the important carved wooden figures lining the staircase and a marble chimneypiece in an upstairs room. Many of the missing carved figures were later replaced by plaster copies moulded from earlier casts taken from the originals.\nThe listing particulars call the house a \"splendid example of Renaissance brickwork\". They note the mansard roof in slate has seven dormer windows, the fourth with a pediment, in the centre a flat roof with a balustrade and a lead cupola standing on a tall octagonal column. As well as its two main storeys, the building has a basement and an attic. A three-bay brick centre stands a little forward of the main front, and the brickwork has stone quoins at the angles. At first floor level are entablatures, with a parapet above, and brick-eared window architraves. The sash windows and their glazing bars date from the early 19th century. The front door with six panels is round-headed, the top panel glazed to let in light, and is set in a moulded architrave. The Tuscan doorcase dates from the 18th century.\n\nInside the house, the important staircase rises from the ground floor to the second floor, and many doors and doorcases, carved stone chimneypieces, and plaster ceilings also date from the 17th century, with 18th-century features added. One large room is completely panelled, from floor to ceiling.\nThe brick forecourt walls of the house, topped with brick balustrading, also date from the 17th century and are listed separately, also at Grade I. Their stone coping, and the stone gate piers with cornices and finials flanking the entrance, are from a later period. The walls and gates of Cromwell House form an architectural group with others in front of the houses on each side.\n\n\n== Name of the house ==\nIn connection with 104, Highgate Hill, the earliest mention of the name Cromwell which has been found is in the Holden London Directory of 1809, which lists George Ranking as living at Cromwell House, so it is probable that Ranking gave the name to the house after he bought it in 1797. Earlier, during the ownership of the da Costa family, there is some evidence that it may have been called Highgate House.\nCromwell House dates from the lifetime of Oliver Cromwell, and its name has led to a widespread belief that he or his son-in-law General Henry Ireton at some point owned or lived in it, or in an earlier building. However, the owners throughout the seventeenth century are well documented, and neither the Protector nor his son-in-law are among them. Nothing even demonstrates that either was ever at Highgate. John Ireton, a brother of the General, was a leading resident of Highgate and was a friend of the Sprignells, and one of them married a daughter of one of those who signed the death warrant of Charles II. The name of Cromwell has also been applied to other houses near London, none of which is connected with him.\n\n\n== Owners and occupiers ==\nSir Robert Sprignell (1622â1690) the eldest son of Sir Richard Sprignell, was the second owner of the house. On the Parliamentary side during the Civil Wars, he is said to have \"deliberately run away\" from the fighting at Cheriton Down. At the Restoration in 1660, he ran away again to the Low Countries, and in 1664 sold the house to George Hill, a member of Clifford's Inn, with its garden, and sold nineteen acres (7.7 hectares) of land adjacent to it to Robert Young, a scrivener in the City of London. Five years later, the house and garden were sold to Sir Thomas Hooke of Lincoln's Inn, who in turn sold it to Alvares da Costa in 1675.\nEscaping the inquisition, Alvares (or Alvaro), a wealthy merchant of Portuguese Jewish origins, had arrived in England in 1661 as part of the entourage of Charles II's wife, Catherine of Braganza. Other members of his family joined him in the country, including Fernando Mendes, his cousin and brother-in-law, who became the Queen's physician. Because of the anti-Catholic fervour of the late 1670s, the family came out openly as Jewish, and thus Cromwell House became the first Jewish-owned property in England since the 1290 Jewish expulsion. The building became the suburban hub of the large da Costa clan, and during their 74-year ownership the house was expanded to meet their needs. Other distinguished family members included the banker Moses da Costa and the miniaturist Catherine da Costa. In 1705, Alvares da Costa bought back the nineteen acres of adjoining land sold by Sir Robert Sprignell, eighteen acres (7.2 hectares) of which was subsequently sold in 1742 by his son who had inherited the estate, but had been in financial difficulties ever since losing heavily in the South Sea Bubble of 1720. He kept only the acre to the east adjoining the garden of the house.\nIn 1749, the House was bought by Sir John Thompson, alderman of the City of London, who died in 1750. On the death of his widow, Dame Catharine Thompson, in 1766, it was sold to Thomas Saunders, who sold it to Samuel Provey, after whose death it was sold in 1797 to George Ranking, a merchant in Cheapside. The next owner, from 1811, was William Higgins of Mill Hill who ten years later sold to Richard Cumberlege Ware, who after just two years sold it to Thomas Hurst, a print seller and publisher. He subsequently became bankrupt, and so in 1833 the house passed to Richard Nixon of 4 The Grove, who brought its use as a private house to an end.\nFrom 1834, Cromwell House was used as a boys' school, run first by William Addison, then from 1843 by Gerrit Van der Linde (1808â1858), a Dutch poet and scholar, who ran a college franÃ§ais, and after his death in 1858 by the Rev. Stretton until the School's closure in 1867. Thomas Bedggood, the owner from 1841, passed the property in trust to his four daughters, who in 1868 granted a 70-year lease to the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children to use as a Convalescent Hospital, with an annual intake of some four hundred young patients. The Hospital moved out of the building in 1924, and the remainder of the lease was bought by the Mothercraft Training Society, founded by Dr Truby King, who espoused a strict method of infant care and nutrition. In the late 1930s the freehold was acquired from the grandchildren of Thomas Bedggood (the Russell family). Between 1928 and 1930 the Society built a residential annex, called The Princess Elizabeth of York Hostel, on the remaining acre of land originally acquired by Alvares da Costa in 1705, and in 1939 the buildings became the Truby King Home for Children.\nIn 1951 the Mothercraft Training Society closed and The Princess Elizabeth of York Hostel (now listed Grade II) was sold separately to the Metropolitan Police Service as accommodation for police officers, and is now student accommodation, accessed from Winchester Place, called Princess Elizabeth House. Cromwell House was sold to the Church of England Zenana Missionary Society (absorbed into the Church Missionary Society in 1957), to be followed in 1970 by the Roman Catholic Montfort Fathers who vacated in 1983. The building stood empty for several years, which worried local residents to such an extent that an Independent Cromwell House Working Group was formed to campaign for the preservation of the house. In 1988, it was sold to a developer who undertook renovations and it was subsequently sold to its current owner, the Republic of Ghana, which uses it as the Visa Section of its High Commission in Belgravia.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nRichardson, John (1983), Highgate: Its History since the Fifteenth Century, Eyre and Spottiswoode, ISBN 0-9503656-4-5\nNorman, Philip (1926), Cromwell House: Historical notes, P.15-35.

    "wikipediaText": "Croydon Palace, in the Old Town neighbourhood of Croydon, now part of south London, was the summer residence of the Archbishop of Canterbury for over 500 years. Regular visitors included Henry III and Queen Elizabeth I. Now known as Old Palace, the buildings are still in use as Old Palace School, an independent girls' school that is now part of the Whitgift Foundation. It has been a Grade I listed building since 1951.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Manor of Croydon was connected with the Archbishop of Canterbury from at least the late Saxon period, and records of buildings date back to before 960. The location of the original manor house is unknown. A larger palace was required to accommodate the retinues of the archbishop and his guests, and as a staging post between Canterbury and Lambeth Palace. The palace as it now exists is a group of largely 15th- and 16th-century buildings, \"an aggregate of buildings of different castes and ages\", as Archbishop Herring found it in 1754. Only the parts used by the archbishops remain: the servants' quarters, which made up the remaining three and a half sides of an irregular quadrangle, were demolished in the 19th century. \nThe palace was entered from Church Street down today's Old Palace Road, which was protected by iron gates from 1742.  Along the south side of today's Church Road was the porter's lodge and stables that formed the north side of the quadrangle. An archway in the porter's lodge permitted access to the palace. South of Church Road, along the east side of the Old Palace Road, were the servants' quarters. This was a two-storey brick building that formed the east side of the quadrangle. A similar building formed the west side of the quadrangle for the servants of guests. The upper storey was accessed by an external wooden staircase and passageway. Kitchens, buttery etc. connected the Great Hall and servants quarters to the east.\nThe 15th-century Great Hall is thought to have been installed by Archbishop Stafford (d. 1452), with a late-14th-century two-storey porch and a vaulted ceiling to the lower chamber. The hall interior has a rich 16th-century timber roof and windows with interesting features such as the late Gothic interior porch. The Great Hall was partially remodelled in the 17th century by archbishops Laud and Juxon, who also rebuilt the chapel.\nWest of the hall are the state apartments including the first-floor Guard Room, now the school library. The room is ascribed to Archbishop Arundel (Archbishop 1396â1414), and has an arch-braced roof with carved stone supports and an oriel window. Other rooms have later panelling and fireplaces. The chapel has fine 17th-century stalls and an elaborate corner gallery. The fine altar rails are now in the Guard Room. The exterior of the whole palace is of stone or red brick, with early stone windows or Georgian sash windows.\nThe connection of the archbishops with Croydon was of great importance, with several being important local benefactors. Six are buried in Croydon Minster, neighbouring the palace: in date order they were Edmund Grindal, John Whitgift, Gilbert Sheldon, William Wake, John Potter and Thomas Herring. Archbishop Whitgift, who first called it a \"palace\", liked Croydon for \"the sweetness of the place\", though not all admired it, in the low-lying site which Henry VIII found \"rheumatick\", a place where he could not stay \"without sickness\". Sir Francis Bacon found it \"an obscure and darke place\" surrounded by its dense woodland.\n\nBy the 18th century, the palace had become dilapidated and uncomfortable and the local area was squalid. In 1715 Archbishop Wake wanted to demolish it, although he subsequently had the Long Gallery reconstructed and Archbishop Herring had other work done. By 1780, it had remained uninhabited for the last 20 years and Parliament decided to build a new palace. A private act of Parliament, the Croydon Palace Act 1780 (20 Geo. 3. c. 57 Pr.), enabled Croydon Palace to be sold and Addington Palace on the outskirts of Croydon to be bought in 1807. This became the new episcopal summer residence for much of the rest of the 19th century.\nCroydon Palace was bought at auction with the adjacent meadows to the south and east by the brandy merchant Abraham Pitches for Â£2,520 on 10 October 1780, which he subsequently let for calico printing and bleaching. The palace had several owners over the next 100 years, but was primarily associated with calico printing, bleaching and later as a laundry. The servants' quarters on the west were demolished around 1802 and became part of the graveyard in 1808. By 1805 the Croydon, Merstham and Godstone Railway cut through the palace grounds, creating today's Church Road. The porter's lodge was demolished around 1806, followed by the kitchens in 1810 to provide another entrance to the palace. Bankruptcy saw the palace sold in lots on 20 March 1832, with the subsequent demolition of the quadrangle's east side. Bleaching continued at the palace until it was sold by private agreement to Henry Pelham-Clinton, the 7th Duke of Newcastle at the beginning of June 1887. He gave the palace to the Sisters of the Church, who restored it and founded it as Old Palace School in 1889.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe historic connection between Croydon and the archbishops is recognised in the modern coat of arms of the London Borough of Croydon. Several streets in Croydon are named after the archbishops, including Whitgift Street, Grindall Close, Sheldon Street, Laud Street, Cranmer Road and Parker Road.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAnderson, John Corbet (1879).

    "wikipediaText": "Croydon Minster is the parish and civic church of the London Borough of Croydon, located in the Old Town area of Croydon. There are currently more than 35 churches in the borough, with Croydon Minster being the most prominent. It is Grade I listed.\nSix Archbishops of Canterbury are buried in the church: Edmund Grindal (d.1583), John Whitgift (d.1604), Gilbert Sheldon (d.1677), William Wake (d.1737), John Potter (d.1747), and Thomas Herring (d.1757).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Medieval church ===\nThe church was established in the middle Saxon period, and is believed to have been a minster church: one which served as a base for a group of clergy living a communal life, who may have taken some pastoral responsibility for the population of the surrounding district. A charter issued by King Coenwulf of Mercia refers to a council which had taken place close to what is called the monasterium (meaning minster) of Croydon. An Anglo-Saxon will made in about 960 is witnessed by Elfsies, priest of Croydon; and the church is also mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086.\nThe earliest clear record of the church's dedication to St John the Baptist is found in the will of John de Croydon, fishmonger, dated 6 December 1347, which includes a bequest to \"the church of S. John de Croydon\".\nIn its final medieval form, the church was mainly a Perpendicular-style structure of late 14th and early 15th-century date. It still bears the arms of archbishops Courtenay and Chichele, believed to have been its benefactors.\n\n\n=== Destruction and rebuilding ===\n\nThe medieval building underwent some restoration in 1851 and 1857â9, under the direction of George Gilbert Scott. However, on the night of 5 January 1867, a fire broke out â possibly caused by overheating of the poorly positioned flues of recently installed Gurney stoves â which eventually gutted the entire building. It was rebuilt to Scott's designs between 1867 and 1869, incorporating some of the medieval remains (notably the west tower and south porch), and essentially following the medieval plan, while enlarging the building by extending its footprint further east. During the period of rebuilding, services were held in a temporary \"iron church\", with seating for 700, erected in April 1868 in Scarbrook Road.\nThe church's reconsecration by Archbishop Archibald Tait took place on 5 January 1870. The church still contains several important monuments and fittings saved from the old building.\n\n\n=== Present day ===\nThe church was elevated to the status of Croydon Minster (the modern honorific title) on 29 May 2011, the first such change in the diocese of Southwark.\nCroydon has strong religious links, Croydon Palace having been a residence of the Archbishop of Canterbury from at least the beginning of the 13th century to the beginning of the 19th. The Bishop of Croydon is a position as an area bishop in the Anglican Diocese of Southwark. The current area bishop is Jonathan Clark, who was consecrated on 21 March 2012. Until recently (mid 2016) the vicar was Colin J. Luke Boswell, Vicar of Croydon and Chaplain to the Whitgift Foundation.\nCroydon Minster today de facto serves as Whitgift School's chapel. It is also linked to The Minster Schools.\nThe Minster stands in the inclusive liberal catholic tradition of the Church of England.\n\n\n== Organ ==\nThe church has a large four-manual pipe organ, much of which is by William Hill & Sons and dates from 1869. There is also a small organ in the St Nicholas Chapel which was obtained from St Mary the Virgin, Preston Candover in 1997.\n\n\n== Organists and Masters of Choristers ==\nBefore the fire of 1867 records are incomplete, but include:\n\nThomas Attwood Walmisley 1830â1833\nJohn Pyke Hullah 1837â?\nAfter the fire of 1867:\n\nJohn Rhodes 1857â1868\nFrederick Cambridge 1868â1911\nF.

The eight original bells were recast and hung with new fittings in a new frame with four additional trebles. The new ring of 12 was dedicated by the Bishop of Croydon on 12 December 1936 and the first peal on the new 12 was rung for the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1937.\nThe tower and ringers are affiliated to the Surrey Association of Church Bell Ringers.\n\n\n== St Johnâs Memorial Garden ==\n\nTo the south of the Minster is St Johnâs Memorial Garden, an area of 2 acres (0.81 ha). Up until 1957 it was a traditional cemetery which was no longer used and had become neglected. Earlier gravestones and tombs were relocated or used for walling or paving and a War Memorial was also repositioned.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAnderson, J.

    "wikipediaText": "The Church of St Mary the Blessed Virgin is an Anglican church in Addington, in the Borough of Croydon, London. It is associated with the Archbishops of Canterbury of the 19th century, who lived at nearby Addington Palace: five of the archbishops are buried at the church.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThere is evidence for a church on this site since at least 1080 AD. It was once the only church in Addington village when it was the centre of a larger parish then incorporating Shirley. It has an 11th-century chancel and windows. The south aisle, built in the early 13th century, is narrow as it once had a thatched roof, hence its falling roofline. The belltower assumed its current form in 1876. The church tower has a belfry with 6 bells, the earliest probably dating from 1380 as well as two 17th-century bells. The bells were restored in 1957. The chancel was richly decorated in 1898 in memory of Archbishop Edward White Benson.\nOn 29 January 1951, St Mary's became a Grade I listed building.\nThe parish was part of the Diocese of Canterbury until 1984 when it joined the Diocese of Southwark.\n\n\n=== Notable burials ===\n\nThe crypt is now inaccessible, but the church is the burial place of a Lord Mayor of the City of London, the armigerous Leigh family who were Lords of the manor, and five of the six Archbishops of Canterbury who spent time at their residence nearby of Addington Palace.\nThe archbishops interred at St Mary's are:\n\nArchbishop Charles Manners-Sutton â died 1828 (buried in a vault under the vestry).\nArchbishop William Howley â died 1848 (buried in the chancel).\nArchbishop John Bird Sumner â died 1862 (buried in the churchyard).\nArchbishop Charles Longley â died 1868 (buried in the churchyard).\nArchbishop Archibald Campbell Tait â died 1882 (buried in the churchyard).\nThere is also a memorial to the archbishops in the graveyard.\nThe churchyard also contains Commonwealth war graves of thirteen service personnel, four from World War I and nine from World War II. (Note: the CWGC site shows 14, but one of these (J. COLLIER) is identified as being an alias of another entry (J. ROSTRON)).\n\n\n=== Home Guard Memorial ===\nThere is a stained glass window serving as a memorial to the services of the 59th (Addington) Battalion of the Home Guard during the Second World War.\n\nAbove the double window is a small circular window bearing the Paschal Lamb emblem of the Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey), along with their motto \"Pristinae Virtutis Memor\".\nAt the top of the double windows (spread over both) is a biblical verse \"Everyone had his sword by his side and so builded. Neh. 4 v 18\".\nAt the bottom, again spread over the two windows, is the dedication: \"To the Glory of God and as a memorial of their service to King and Country by members of the 59th Surrey (Addington) Battalion Home Guard, this window is erected. 1952.\"\n\n\n== Present day ==\nNow the church ministers to the people living in the more immediate vicinity that includes Addington village, the southern elevation of and escarpment running down from the Addington Hills, the residences along Fieldway on the northernmost part of the New Addington estate, Addington and Forestdale.\nThe church stands in the Modern Catholic tradition of the Church of England.\n\n\n== Notable clergy ==\nJohn Cavell was a curate here between 1947 and 1949, he later became Bishop of Southampton\nMichael Perham was a curate here between 1976 and 1981, he later became Bishop of Gloucester\n\n\n== Images ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nChurch website\nA Church Near You entry"

    "wikipediaText": "St Mary's is a 12th- or 13th-century English re-used church building, during its religious lifetime dedicated to St Mary, in the London suburb of Perivale. It was the smallest of Anglican churches in the dissolved county of Middlesex, excluding the City of London. It became separated from almost all of its parish's population by the development and heavy traffic on the A40 trunk road so that the parish was dissolved and church disbanded in 1972. It was adopted by a charitable organisation formed from the local community, the Friends of St Mary, and it functions as an arts centre, holding local exhibitions and performances of classical music.\nThe church is built of rag-stone and flint, and its tower is unusual, being clad in white weatherboarding. It contains a chime of three bells, all cast in 1949 as a World War II memorial for the war dead of the community and small parish as a whole.\nThe church was Grade I listed in 1950.\n\n\n== See also ==\nElthorne Hundred: its parishes map showing the extent of Perivale before it was redistributed among similar old and more modern parishes.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nWeb site for the church"

    "wikipediaText": "St Mary the Virgin is a 13th-century Anglican parish church in Northolt, London Borough of Ealing. It is on a slope shared with Belvue Park, the site of a 15th-century manor house â both overlooked the old village of Northolt. It is one of London's smallest churches, its nave measuring 15 yards (14 m) by 8 yards (7.3 m). The church was built around 1290 and was expanded over the centuries, with the chancel being added in 1521, the spired bell tower in the 16th century, and a gallery at the west end of the church in 1703. Twin buttresses were erected against the west wall around 1718 to alleviate concerns that the church could slip down the hill. The internal beams are original and the bells date from the 17th century. The church was constructed from a variety of materials; the nave incorporates clunch (a type of limestone), flint and ironstone, and the mouldings of the doors and windows are made from Reigate Stone.\nThe church has been important ecclesiastically. From the 13th century to 1873 its rector was the Bishop of London, delegating the benefice (living, role as priest) to a vicar during that time. In the late 20th century it became the first Anglican parish to appoint a female rector, Rev. Pamela Walker.\nIt is one of two churches in the parish; the second, dedicated to St Richard, is large and modern. The churches share the same most senior cleric (rector) who conducts morning Sunday service at St Mary's Church, assists with the Sunday School, and then another service at 5pm at St Richard's Church.\n\n\n== Building and contents ==\nThe small south porch was partly rebuilt in 1909, and a south vestry added in 1945. The nave dates substantially from the 14th century, but incorporates late-13th-century fragments. The chancel and nave roof were rebuilt in the early 16th century, and the square bell turret, which is weather-boarded and finished with a broach spire, dates from the same period. Buttresses, including the massive ones of brick at the west end, were added in the 18th century, and the church was among the majority \"restored\", i.e. considerably rebuilt in the 19th century. The octagonal stone font dates from the 14th century. The bowl is decorated with simple relief carving, and the wooden cover is dated 1624. There are four early 17th-century bells, the sanctus (tonic bell) cast in 1626. A wooden gallery of three bays, supported on Doric columns and said to have been constructed in 1703, is built across the west end of the nave. Other fittings include an 18th-century painting of the Adoration of the Magi on the north wall of the chancel, and a 17th-century carving of the Stuart arms, executed in painted wood, on the east wall of the nave. There are brasses with figures to Henry Rowdell (d. 1452) and Isaiah Bures (vicar 1596â1610). A 16th-century palimpsest brass commemorates the Gifford family. Wall tablets in the chancel and nave commemorate 18th and 19th century vicars and members of the Shadwell family.\nThe plate consists of a silver paten and cup dated 1702, and an electroplate dish of 1839. The registers record baptisms from 1560, marriages from 1575, and burials from 1583, transcribed to large databases.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Styles of liturgy and modernisations ===\nLittle is written of the religious history before the 17th century. Some of the medieval and later vicars seem to have been pluralists (spread across parishes). In 1302 the vicar was included in a list of Middlesex incumbents excommunicated for nonpayment of the papal tenth. Staunchly Protestant moves imposed nationally during the rule of Oliver Cromwell saw some opposition. George Palmer (vicar 1638â43) was sequestered (bankrupted) in 1643 on the grounds that he spoke against Parliament, \"enjoyed incestuous relations\" with his sister-in-law, and had \"deserted\" his cure to join the \"Royalist Army\". Palmer seems to have enjoyed considerable popularity among the parishioners, who described his successor, Robert Malthus (vicar 1643â61), as \"a factious preacher\". The parishioners petitioned Cromwell for his removal, alleging that he was an unsatisfactory speaker, preached against the army in Scotland, and failed to observe national thanksgiving, Malthus retained the living until the Restoration. The years after 1661 are marked by laxity in the administration of the cure and in the maintenance of the church fabric. William Brabourne (vicar 1661â84) was frequently absent from the parish. During which the cure was served by a curate whose office is first mentioned in 1617. By 1664 parts of the church were falling into disrepair. There was no chalice, and the plate consisted of one silver cup and a pewter plate. The churchyard was unfenced, so that pigs entered. In 1685 it was ordered that adequate plate be provided and the churchyard be new-railed. The churchyard was still open to incursions by pigs and sheep in 1715, but the church was said to be in reasonable repair. Pews had recently been installed and a new gallery erected at the west end for the use of singers and servants. Several 18th-century vicars were absentees, relieved by the curate. Goronwy Owen, Welsh poet, served as curate from 1755 to 1758. During this period services were held twice on Sundays, and there were between 5 and 7 Communions a year. By 1790 the annual number of Communions had fallen to 4, and there were only 10 communicants. In 1965 evensong and Communion were celebrated daily, and there were four Sunday services.\n\n\n=== Daughter parish and churches ===\nRapid increases in population during the 1930s and extensive council development after 1945 led to the formation of three daughter churches between 1940 and 1960, two sharing a southern new parish carved out of Northolt (St Joseph and St Hugh's).\n\nSt Joseph the Worker for the southwest, West End, area, first met in 1942 in temporary premises off Watery Road demolished in 1944 to make way for houses, and the congregation continued to meet in a variety of buildings. In 1957 services were being held in Arundell School and in the church-house in Hawtrey Avenue. Then followed a brick-built dual-purpose hall behind the 'White Hart' in Ruislip Road, dedicated in 1959. In 1963 land in Yeading Lane had been purchased for the erection of a new church.\nin south-east Northolt from about 1948 occasional services were held in a builder's hut . A semipermanent hut at the junction of Kensington Road and Ruislip Road was dedicated in 1954 as the church of St Hugh, later rebuilt.\nIn 1958 services began being held in a youth club hut on the Northolt Park housing estate in the north. The hut was burnt down in 1959, and the congregation then met in Vincent School. A dual-purpose hall-church in Haydock Avenue was consecrated in 1960 as the church of St Richard.\n\n\n=== Appointments and assets ===\nA priest is recorded at Northolt in 1086. A church is mentioned c. 1140. The oldest parts of the present building are consistent with the 13th century. The church served the whole of the parish until 1954 when the new parish of St. Barnabas was formed from a north-east area and part of the Greenford parish of Holy Cross.\nThe church formed part of the endowment of Walden Abbey (priory), founded by Geoffrey de Mandeville about 1140. The abbey continued to exercise its rights to it until some time between 1241 and 1251 when the prior's claims were disputed by St. Paul's Cathedral. The matter was referred to Peter de Newport, Archdeacon of London, and it was agreed that a vicarage should be instituted and the patronage vested in the Bishop of London and his successors. The vicars were to pay 12 marks annually towards the maintenance of St. Paul's Cathedral whose Dean and Chapter were to present (appoint the vicar and any other clerics) during vacancies of the London see (any times of no bishop). About 1247 there was said to be no vicarage, and the exact date of its ordination is unknown. According to an early-15th-century source the vicarage was ordained in 1388, but since the first recorded vicars date from the late 13th century, the document referred to is almost certainly the confirmation of an earlier ordinance. The Bishop continued to exercise the patronage until 1864, in which year it was transferred to Brasenose College, Oxford. The college holds the right to appoint the rector, the advowson.\nThe benefice of Northolt was valued at 12 marks in the mid 13th century. The Abbot of Walden received two marks from the profits of the benefice, and the Prior of Hurley in Berkshire half a mark. In 1291 the church was valued at Â£5; the Prior of Hurley still received his annual pension, and no payment to Walden is recorded. Presumably the vicar then enjoyed the rectorial estate. An agreement made in 1518 between the Bishop of London and the Vicar confirmed the latter's right to great and small tithes in consideration of Â£4 annually to this bishop. In 1535 Henry VIII through Thomas Cromwell saw all livings' annual value noted, in a compilation named the King's Books, finding it worth Â£15. Twelve years later the 'parsonage' was worth Â£26 and the vicar held (farmed out) 31 acres in the common fields. There were then no charities, obits (obituary legacies), or lights (stained glass), and the vicar furnished the cure himself. By 1610 the vicarage was a house with two barns, stable, orchard, garden, three closes of meadow containing 20 acres, lands in the Northolt common fields, and houses and land in Greenford parish. In 1650 general assets stood at 48 acres of glebe, the great and small tithes were valued together at Â£170, the total of these being Â£205. During the early 18th century the amount of glebe remained fairly constant, about 50 acres; income from tithes and glebe about Â£250. Under the 1835 inclosure award two modest closes: Hedges Meadow and Catherine Mead to the south and east of the house were allotted to the vicar in lieu of common field land, and glebe fell to 44 a. After the Greenford inclosure award of 1816 the Vicar of Northolt's right to tithes payable on old common-field land in Greenford parish was disputed by the Rector of Greenford. In 1841 the Greenford tithes were commuted by the population, the whole of the resultant rentcharge was apportioned to the Rector of Greenford, and the tithes payable to Northolt extinguished. The Northolt tithes were redeemed for Â£682 the next year. The net value of the living in 1835 was Â£539. Most of the glebe was sold for building after 1920.\nA vicarage house is first mentioned in 1610. In 1692 the old house, wherever it may have been, was demolished by Charles Alston whose new vicarage built on a site off Ealing Road, by 1715 as a brick-built house with seven principal rooms, kitchen, dairy, cellars, outbuildings, and walled garden. Minor additions to the house were made during the 19th century, but after 1900 it fell into disrepair. The house was demolished in 1928. In 1963 the vicar was living in a semi-detached house in Church Road.\n\n\n== References ==\nWorks consulted\n\"St Mary the Virgin, Northolt\".

    "wikipediaText": "Boston Manor House is an English Jacobean manor house built in 1622 with internal alterations, intensively restored in later centuries. It was the manor house of one of the early medieval-founded manors in Middlesex.  Since 1965 the manor's small part of the parish of Hanwell has been part of the London Borough of Hounslow in west London. Boston Manor Park is the publicly owned green space, including a lake, which adjoins the house.\n\n\n== History of the former manor of Boston ==\nThe earliest reference to Boston (or Bordwadestone as it was then spelled) was around the 1170s. Bordwad has not been identified with a group of people or physical feature and so it is assumed the first part of this word means Bord's. The final part of the word is the common ending  i.e. farmstead. It was towards the northern end its lands â its manor.  The Lord of the manor is recorded as Ralph de Brito.  There is no record as to where he built his manor house. He founded a chapel dedicated to St. Lawrence in the south of the manor on a site that is now derelict. The ecclesiastical boundary under this chapel was â or became over time â conterminous with the manor boundary.  The approximate four boundaries were the Piccadilly line from the east end of Boston Manor Underground station's sidings to the Brent, the Brent down to the Thames, the Thames to Half Acre Road, and Boston Manor Road.\nThe northern extent of the manor was marked by a boundary stone. Later a tree to the west of it came to be the local Gospel Oak.  Here the old pagan custom of blessing the field and crops took place whilst beating the bounds. Thus, the boundary of chapelry of St. Lawrence coexisted with that of the manor.  It was a part of the parish of Hanwell until moved into Brentford.\nThen in about 1280 Edward I granted this area of the township to the prioress of St Helen's Bishopsgate. It is at this point Boston became a recognised rural settlement.   The prioress received what amounted to \"constructive possession\" and ownership. The King did this to make raising tax easier and it had the benefit of deterring alienation of part, a process then called subinfeudation, keeping the land together until the dissolution of the monasteries.\nThe King may have favoured this particular Convent in Bishopsgate because it was full of the unmarried daughters of members of the Guild of Goldsmiths, and so by making them self-supporting by giving them the means to charge their new tenants rents and to sell the produce grown on their newly acquired demesne, he could justify taxing their fathers more heavily and collect the tax in the form of silver coinage, which was more convenient. \n\nIn 1539, Henry VIII's national reforms saw the convent dissolved and the manor (including its holdings) returned to the Crown.\nThe Crown granted the lands in or shortly before 1547 to Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset during the reign of Edward VI.\nWhen the Duke was beheaded, his lands were forfeited under the Counter-Reformation of Mary I to The Crown until Elizabeth I granted it to her favourite Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester who immediately sold it to Sir Thomas Gresham, an internationally wealthy merchant and financier who had also bought Osterley as his summer residence. He later founded the Royal Exchange.\nAs Gresham died without issue, the property went to his stepson Sir William Reade who lived in Osterley so had to obtain a Patent of Possession in 1610 from James I so that he could inherit. He married Mary Goldsmith, who immediately after his death built Boston Manor House in 1622â1623. She then married Sir Edward Spencer of Althorp, who therefore gained the equitable ownership and who appears to have bought out the claim of the late William Reade's heirs so that upon her death in 1658 the lands passed to her heir John Goldsmith. In 1670 his executors sold Boston to another very wealthy city merchant: James Clitherow I. The price he paid for the house with its then 230 acres (0.93 km2) for his own use, was Â£5,136, 17s, 4d (equivalent to Â£1,056,000 in 2023).\nThe manor was gradually reduced by the Clitherow family for the next 250 years.  The neighbouring settlement of Brentford expanded onto the property of this manor, which largely became known as the Manor of New Brentford.\nThe population had grown so much by 1621 that the chapelry council assumed administrative township status known as the New Brentford Township â the letters NBT can be seen on local boundary stones.\nDuring the 18th century the area was referred to overwhelmingly as Boston Manor in preference to New Brentford.\nJohn Bourchier Stracey-Clitherow was the last private owner of the manor. In 1923 he sold the final part of the estate: the house and 20 acres (8.1 ha) purchased by the Brentford Urban District Council and opened as a public park in 1924.\nThe Green Flag Award scheme, which recognises and rewards the best green spaces in England and Wales, has given this award to Boston Manor Park in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009.\n\n\n== Boston Manor House ==\n\n\n=== History of the manor house ===\n\nThe manor house was built in 1622-3 for the newly widowed, and shortly to be remarried  Dame Mary Reade, whose late husband was granted a patent of possession for Boston Manor from James I. \nTo the north of the house the Clitherow family added  extensions  that contained  the kitchen services and quarters for the domestic staff.\nJohn Bourchier Stracey-Clitherow was the last private owner of Boston Manor House, which he sold in 1923. The house and the surrounding 20 acres (8.1 ha)  was purchased by the Brentford Urban District Council, and was opened as a public park in  1924.\nThe house was badly damaged during World War II by a V1 dropping across the road. \nFor a time it was used as a school. After extensive restoration work, it was re-opened in 1963 by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother as a visitor centre and museum.\nDue to its unique architecture and decoration it has been often used as a setting for period films.\nThere came a time when the south west corner was propped up by scaffolding intended to be a temporary measure but which became a feature for several years. English Heritage judged that urgent work was needed in order to consolidate the foundations to prevent further deterioration and possible collapse. The lower courses of brickwork were visibly bowing out and a vertical crack could be seen running up the wall. This has since been repaired.\nAn organisation called the Friends of Boston Manor now  exists with the aim of helping to restore and maintain the historical aspects of Boston Manor Park and House.\nFollowing six years of renovation, the house reopened to the public on 7 July 2023.\n\n\n=== Description of the house ===\n\nThe manor house is a Grade I listed Jacobean manor house on the west-side of  Boston Manor Road, Brentford, in the London Borough of Hounslow, England. Set in 20 acres (8.1 ha) of parkland, it is Hounslow's only building of the Jacobean period. It is situated in beautiful grounds which gently slope down to the nearby River Brent, from which Brentford gets its name. The house has thick walls of red brick and stands three storeys high. The windows are set into stone architraves and a stone cornice between the second and third storeys of the house. It has three gables on the longer sides and two on the shorter with stone coping. The rainwater downpipe headers which collect from the roof gutters are each embossed with dates. The three on the original part of the house are dated 1662, this being the date that building began. Another is 1670, which was when the third gable was added, and 1915 for when improvements were made to the drainage system.\nIt was traditional with grand houses of this time to consider the front side of the house to be that side which looks out over an elegantly landscaped garden.  However, during the ownership of James Clitherow (IV),  the central ground floor window on the east side was converted into a doorway and a porch was added. It is fashioned from pale grit stone which  has weathered to an almost light golden colour, with Elizabethan detail, and topped with a low ornamental balustrade. Considering its design and apparent age, it is thought to have been salvaged from another building.\nGoing through this porch and the new front doorway one comes into the entrance hall. It extends to the west side of the house and the former front door. Halfway between, however, is a wooden divide or screen which was added around the 19th century, and the east half was given a new ceiling. \nOn the immediate left of the hall is the dining room. It is not very large and is painted in a bright yellow which was both popular and expensive when it was in fashion. It has a number of prints and paintings hanging on the walls of local scenes from times gone by.\nOnce back in the hallway and walking through the screen, there is to the left-hand side a door to the library, which is about the same size as the dining room. It has some interesting features.  Unfortunately the room now remains locked and cannot be seen by visitors due to the dangerous condition of the wall on that side of the house. Beyond the library door is the west side door to the garden.\nThe west side of the hall also has a mostly original left hand winding Jacobean staircase. \nThe angle of ascent (or rake) of the stairs is more gentle than in modern buildings, with both a lower âriseâ to the next tread and deeper ârunâ to the next step. The treads are bullnosed and obediently creak to each and every footfall a visitor may place upon them. \nSquare carved oak newel posts support the ends of banisters with carved tapered balusters running between. The opposite side of the stairs are mirrored with a  Trompe d'Åil balustrade. For this period in England, this is an extremely  rare example of this technique and so is now been preserved behind transparent sheets. The design has striking similarities to those at Hatfield House.\nA 19th-century addition to the top of the newel posts are small plaster or composition castings of lions which are  sitting on their  haunches, with their bodies erect and both forepaws raised from the ground (i.e.,  holding  âsejant erect attitudeâ), Each animal hold a shield bearing the arms of  a different  Clitherow member. These may have been added for the visit of King William IV and Queen Adelaide; for although the Clitherows were commoners they could nevertheless trace their family tree back to the reign of Henry V.\n\nThe two landings give a fine view over the garden with its cedar trees, planted in 1754.\nWith the commanding view that the house provides to the south and south west, one can almost imagine a little over a hundred years before that, when the then King Charles I could have been pacing from window to window with his loyal supporter Sir Edward Spencer, watching Prince Rupert's  troops engaging  with the Parliamentarians during the Battle of Brentford. Apart from local folklore though, there is nothing to support this as having happened. It is almost equally disappointing to discover, that despite the historically rich ambience that follows one about from room to room, only one ghost has chosen to remain in residence. It is said to be that of the unquiet spirit of young master John Clitherow, who drowned at an untimely and early age.\nAfter the second flight of stairs one arrives at the second floor. To the right is the door to a small anteroom on the west side of the house. Next to this is the state bedroom with a splendid Jacobean decorated plaster ceiling in high relief. The central panel depicts a female figure representing âHopeâ  with her cross-anchor; below is the word in Latin. This symbol pre-dates Christianity: Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil; Hebrews 6:19 (KJV). Despite this, Dame Mary Reade died childless.\nFrom here and though the doorway to the east side is the state drawing room; so called because this is where the ladies would withdraw after dinner, leaving the menfolk to smoke and sample the cellar. Boston Manor House is famous for this room: it is large, with a high  and magnificent Jacobean ceiling, with some elements designed by the 17th-century Dutch artist Marcus Gheeraerts, and engraved by Galle. In one corner is recorded the date of building, and Mary Reade's initials in another. An equally ornate chimney-piece over the mantel is based on a print by the Flemish-born engraver Abraham de Bruyn which depicts Abraham about to sacrifice Isaac on the Mount of Moriah. These high relief mouldings are all acknowledged to be excellent examples of the Jacobean period.\n\nOn the wall along the final top flight of stairs can be seen some 18th-century wallpaper, which was  discovered  during restoration work. While it has become distressed with time, it is considered to be among the best examples which have survived into present times.\nLike most houses that have served as homes, when necessary it has been improved and modernised, by the Clitherow family. The original windows were replaced by box-sash and unfolding wooden panels or screens. These would be unfurled across the windows at dusk to keep in the heat, as well as keeping the house more secure. Central heating was also installed, as was gas for the kitchens.\nThe wall have been hung with hand-printed flock wallpaper.  Much of the furniture in the house has been lent by the Gunnersbury Park Museum.\nThe art collection includes an oil on canvas of Christopher Clitherow by Godfrey Kneller; oils of Syon House and Isleworth by James Isaiah Lewis; an oil of James Clitherow (1766â1841) by Henry William Pickersgill; and an oil of James Clitherow (1731â1805) by George Romney.\n\n\n=== Park opening hours and events ===\n\nThe park is free and open to the public every day: 8am-dusk It has a modern and fully equipped children's playground, plus 3 tennis courts, and a basketball court. Friends of Boston Manor volunteers run a cafeteria at weekends. Recently a Nature Trail has been laid out. There are formal lawns and an ornamental lake with wildfowl. Car boot sales are held on the first Saturday of every month from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.\n\n\n=== Other historic neighbours ===\nBoston Manor House is surrounded by other historic neighbours.

    "wikipediaText": "Chiswick House is a Neo-Palladian style villa in the Chiswick district of London, England. A \"glorious\" example of Neo-Palladian architecture in west London, the house was designed and built by Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington (1694â1753), and completed in 1729. The house and garden occupy 26.33 hectares (65.1 acres). The garden was created mainly by the architect and landscape designer William Kent, and it is one of the earliest examples of the English landscape garden.\nAfter the death of the 3rd Earl of Burlington in 1753, and the subsequent deaths of his last surviving daughter (Charlotte Boyle) in 1754 and his widow in 1758, the property was ceded to William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire, Charlotte's husband. After William's death in 1764, the villa passed to his and Charlotte's orphaned young son, William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire. His wife, Georgiana Spencer, a prominent and controversial figure in fashion and politics whom he married in 1774, used the house as a retreat and as a Whig stronghold for many years; it was where Charles James Fox died in 1806. Prime Minister George Canning also died there in 1827, in a bedroom in the John White wing buildings.\nDuring the 19th century, the house fell into decline and was rented out by the Cavendish family. It was used as a mental hospital, the Chiswick Asylum, from 1892. In 1929, the 9th Duke of Devonshire sold Chiswick House to Middlesex County Council, and it became a fire station. The villa suffered damage during World War II, and in 1944, a V-2 rocket damaged one of the two wings, which were both demolished in 1956. Today, the house is a Grade I listed building and is maintained by English Heritage.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history (c. 1610â1682) ===\nThe original Chiswick House was a Jacobean house owned by Sir Edward Wardour, and possibly built by his father. It is dated c.â1610 in a late 17th-century engraving of the Chiswick House estate by Jan Kip and Leonard Knyff, and was constructed with four sides around an open courtyard. Wardour sold the house in 1624 to Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset. The house was quite large: in the 1664 Hearth Tax documents it is recorded as having 33 fireplaces. The house was at the south end of the Royalist line in the Battle of Turnham Green (1641), during the First English Civil War. The house was purchased by Charles Boyle, 3rd Viscount Dungarvan in 1682.\n\n\n=== Boyle family (1682â1758) ===\n\nThe Jacobean house was used by the Boyle family as a summer retreat from their central London home, Burlington House. After a fire in 1725, Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington (Lord Burlington), then head of the family, decided to build a new \"villa\" to the west of the old Chiswick House.\nDuring his trip to Italy in 1719, Burlington had acquired a passion for Palladian architecture. He had not closely inspected Roman ruins or made detailed drawings on the sites in Italy; he relied on Palladio and Scamozzi as his interpreters of the classic tradition. Another source of his inspiration were drawings he collected, including those of Palladio himself, which had belonged to Inigo Jones and his pupil John Webb. According to Howard Colvin, \"Burlington's mission was to reinstate in Augustan England the canons of Roman architecture as described by Vitruvius, exemplified by its surviving remains, and practised by Palladio, Scamozzi and Jones.\"\nBurlington, himself a talented amateur architect and (in the words of Horace Walpole) \"Apollo of the Arts\", designed the villa with the aid of William Kent, who also took a leading role in designing the gardens. Burlington built the villa with enough space to house his art collection, regarded as containing \"some of the best pictures in Europe\", and his more select pieces of furniture, some of which was purchased on his first Grand Tour of Europe in 1714. Construction of the villa took place between 1726 and 1729.\nAfter Burlington's death in 1753, his wife, Lady Dorothy Savile, and daughter, Charlotte, who had married William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire in 1748, inherited the house.  Charlotte died in December 1754, and Lady Burlington died in September 1758. Several views of Burlington's house were made by the architect-draughtsman John Donowell around this time.\n\n\n=== Cavendish family (1758â1929) ===\n\nAfter the death of Lady Burlington in 1758, the villa and gardens passed to the Cavendish family. William Cavendish died in 1764, leaving the property to his son William, the 5th Duke of Devonshire. In 1774, William married Lady Georgiana Spencer, the Duchess of Devonshire, who enjoyed spending time at Chiswick which she referred to as her \"earthly paradise\". She regularly invited members of the Whig party to the house for tea parties in the garden. In 1788 the Cavendish family demolished the Jacobean house and hired architect John White to add two wings to the villa to increase the amount of accommodation. The Duchess was responsible for the building of the Classical Bridge in 1774, designed by the architect James Wyatt, and the planting of roses on the walls of the new wings and the sides of the buildings. She died in 1806.\nIn 1813, a 300 feet (91 m) conservatory was built by Samuel Ware, with the purpose of housing exotic fruits and camellias. > Gardener Lewis Kennedy built an Italian inspired geometric garden around the conservatory. In 1827, after a rapid decline in health, Tory Prime Minister George Canning died in the same room where Charles James Fox had died in 1806.\n\nBetween 1862 and 1892 the villa was rented by the Cavendish family to a number of successive tenants, including the Duchess of Sutherland in 1867, the Prince of Wales in the 1870s, and John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute, patron of the architect William Burges, from 1881 to 1892.\n\n\n=== Chiswick Asylum (1892â1928) ===\nFrom 1892, the 9th Duke of Devonshire rented the villa to Doctors Thomas Seymour and Charles Molesworth Tuke (sons of Thomas Harrington Tuke), and it was used by them as a mental hospital, the Chiswick Asylum, for wealthy male and female patients until 1928. The asylum was praised for its relatively compassionate approach to its inmates. The wings of the house used for the asylum were demolished in the 1950s so little now remains of this use, except in archival records. In 1897, the two sphinxes on the main gate were removed to Green Park during the celebrations of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. They were never returned.\n\n\n=== Public ownership (1929âpresent) ===\n\nThe 9th Duke of Devonshire sold Chiswick House to Middlesex County Council in 1929,  the purchase price being met in part by contributions from public subscribers, including King George V. The villa became a fire station during World War II, and suffered damage; vibration from the bombing of Chiswick brought down the plasterwork in the Upper Tribunal, and on 8 September 1944 a V-2 rocket damaged one of the two wings. The wings were removed in 1956.\nIn 1948, extensive lobbying from the newly created Georgian Group prevented it from being destroyed. The house came under the aegis of the Ministry of Works and subsequently of English Heritage.\nHounslow Council and English Heritage formed the Chiswick House and Gardens Trust in 2005 to unify the management of the villa and gardens. The trust took over the administration for the villa and gardens in July 2010, following the completion of the restoration works. A Heritage Lottery Fund grant was complemented by approximately Â£4 million from other sources, for restoration of the gardens in 2007. The garden is open to the public from dawn until dusk without charge.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nChiswick House was an attempt by Lord Burlington to create a Roman villa, rather than a Renaissance pastiche, situated in a symbolic Roman garden. Chiswick Villa is inspired in part by several buildings of the 16th-century Italian architects Andrea Palladio and his assistant Vincenzo Scamozzi. The house is often said to be directly inspired by Palladio's Villa Capra \"La Rotonda\" near Vicenza, as architect Colen Campbell had offered Lord Burlington a design for a villa closely based on the Villa Capra for his use at Chiswick. However, although this was clearly influential, Lord Burlington rejected this design; it was subsequently used at Mereworth Castle, Kent. Lord Burlington's library list at Chiswick shows that he was not restricted to the influence of Andrea Palladio. He owned books by influential Italian Renaissance architects such as Sebastiano Serlio and Leon Battista Alberti, and his library contained books by French architects, sculptors, illustrators and architectural theorists like Jean Cotelle, Philibert de l'Orme, Abraham Bosse, Jean Bullant, Salomon de Caus, Roland FrÃ©art de Chambray, Hugues Sambin, Antoine Desgodetz, and John James's translation of Claude Perrault's Treatise of the Five Orders. Whether Palladio's work inspired Chiswick or not, the Renaissance architect exerted an important influence on Lord Burlington through his plans and reconstructions of lost Roman buildings; many of these, unpublished and little known, were purchased by Burlington on his second Grand Tour and housed in the Blue Velvet Room, which served as his study. These reconstructions were the source for many of the varied geometric shapes within Burlington's Villa, including the use of the octagon, circle and rectangle (with apses). Burlington's use of Roman sources can be seen in features including the steep-pitched dome of the villa, which is derived from the Pantheon in Rome. However, the source for the octagonal form of the dome, the Upper Tribunal, Lower Tribunal and cellar at Chiswick may be Scamozzi's Rocca Pisana near Vicenza. Burlington may also have been influenced in his choice of octagon by the drawings of the Renaissance architect Sebastiano Serlio (1475â1554), or by Roman buildings of antiquity (for example, Lord Burlington owned Andrea Palladio's drawings of the octagonal mausoleum at Diocletian's Palace, Split in modern Croatia).\nThe brick-built Villa's faÃ§ade is faced in Portland stone, with a small amount of stucco. The finely carved Corinthian capitals on the projecting six-column portico, carved by John Boson, are derived from the Temple of Castor and Pollux in Rome. The inset door, projecting plinth and 'v'-necked rusticated vermiculation (resembling tufa) were all derived from the base of Trajan's Column. The short sections of crenellated wall with ball finials which extend out either side of the villa were symbolic of medieval (or Roman) fortified town walls, and were inspired by their use by Palladio at his church of San Giorgio Maggiore in Venice and by Inigo Jones (1573â1652) (Palladio produced woodcuts of the Villa Foscari with crenellated sections of walls in his I quattro libri dell'architettura in 1570, yet they were never built). To reinforce this link, two full-length statues of Palladio and Jones are positioned in front of these sections of wall. Palladio's influence is also felt in the general cubic form of the villa with its central hall with other rooms leading off its axis. The villa is a half cube of 70 feet (21 m) by 70 feet (21 m) by 35 feet (11 m). The house when built was described by John, Lord Hervey as \"Too small to live in, and too big to hang to a watch\". John Clerk of Penicuik described it as \"Rather curious than convenient\", while Horace Walpole called it \"the beautiful model\".\n\n\n== Gardens ==\n\nThe gardens at Chiswick were an attempt to recreate a garden of ancient Rome, such as the Emperor Hadrian's Villa Adriana at Tivoli. From the 1720s, Burlington and Kent experimented with new designs, incorporating elements such as a Ha-ha, classical garden buildings, statues, groves, faux Egyptian objects, bowling greens, winding walks, cascades and water features. A theatre of hedges known as an exedra was designed by William Kent and originally displayed ancient statues of three unknown Roman gentlemen. The lawn at the rear of the house was created by 1745 and planted with young Cedar of Lebanon trees which alternate with stone funerary urns designed by William Kent. Placed between the urns and the Cedar of Lebanon are three more sphinxes orientated to face the rising sun.\nA lake was created around 1727 by widening the Bollo Brook. The excess soil was heaped up behind William Kent's cascade to produce an elevated walkway for people to admire the gardens and a view of the nearby River Thames. A gateway designed by Inigo Jones in 1621 at Beaufort House in Chelsea (home of Sir Hans Sloane) was bought and removed by Lord Burlington and rebuilt in the gardens at Chiswick in 1738. The Classic Bridge beyond the Orange Tree Garden was built for Georgiana Spencer in 1774 to the design of James Wyatt. \nThe kitchen garden was created in 1682 as part of an adjoining property. Its ownership changed several times, and the garden fell into disrepair. In 2005 it was restored by local volunteers of the Chiswick House Kitchen Garden charity. In 2009 the charity was awarded a grant from the Big Lottery Fund Local Food Scheme, which it had transferred to the Chiswick House and Gardens Trust to fund a community gardener and to assist with the ongoing operation of the kitchen garden.\n\n\n== Freemasonry ==\n\nChiswick House has been linked with Freemasonry, and is believed by some scholars to have functioned as a private Masonic Lodge or Temple (unaffiliated to Grand Lodge), given that many of the ceiling paintings by William Kent in the Gallery and the Red, Blue and Summer Parlour Rooms contain iconography of a strong Masonic, Hermetic, and possible Jacobite character. The proportions of several of the upstairs rooms also have significance in relation to biblical buildings important in Freemasonry. Lord Burlington's status as an important Freemason is indicated by his inclusion in the Freemason's Pocket Companion of 1736 and in a poem in James Anderson's Constitutions of the Free-Masons of 1723 where he is linked to an illustrious line of personalities important in Masonic lore. Pat Rogers has argued (following the original research of Jane Clark) that Chiswick House was a symbolic temple, based on so-called Royal Arch Freemasonry, involving a Hermetic intervention designed to heal the sufferings of the exiled Jews. Lord Burlington's handwritten list of titles in his library at Chiswick also shows that he supported a large number of publications by Freemasons. \nAfter completion of the villa in 1729, Burlington later provided inspiration to other Masonic architects for numerous other buildings, such as Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester at Holkham Hall, Norfolk Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond, at Goodwood House, and the Mansion House, nicknamed the \"Egyptian Hall\" for its columns.\n\n\n== Notable guests ==\nAlthough little is known of the people who stayed or visited the house in Lord Burlington's lifetime, many important visitors to the property are recorded as visiting throughout its history. These included leading figures of the European 'Enlightenment' including the philosophers Voltaire (1694â1778) and Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712â1778); the future US Presidents John Adams (1735â1826) and Thomas Jefferson (1743â1826); Benjamin Franklin (1706â1790); the German landscape artist Prince Hermann von PÃ¼ckler-Muskau; the Italian statesman Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807â1882); Russian Tsars Nicholas I (1796â1855) and Alexander I (1777â1825); the shah of Persia; Queen Victoria (1819â1901) and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg (1819â61); Sir Walter Scott (1771â1832); Prince Leopold III, Duke of Anhalt-Dessau (1740â1817); Prime Ministers William Ewart Gladstone (1809â1898) and Sir Robert Walpole (1676â1745); Queen Caroline of Brandenburg-Ansbach (1683â1737); John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute (1713â92) and the architect William Burges (1827â1881).\nOn 20 May 1966, the Beatles visited Chiswick House to shoot promotional films for both sides of their latest 45 RPM single, \"Paperback Writer\" and \"Rain\". There are scenes shot in the conservatory, in the walled garden and by the exedra.\n\n\n== Events ==\nSince the restoration of the gardens, a variety of seasonal events have been held in the gardens of Chiswick House each year, including a Camellia show, open days in the walled kitchen garden, a circus, and a magic lantern festival.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBibliography\nGroves, Linden; Mawrey, Gillian (24 August 2010).

Altered with new glazing and a modernised heating system in 1855. The glazed superstructure was replaced in 1932 to 1933 by Messenger and Co, and again in 2008 to 2010 closely matching the 1930s glazing pattern but retaining the patent clear span post-tensioned steel rafter system and rods and gears providing the roof ventilation system.    \n\n                    \n\n\n    \n        Reasons for Designation\n    \n    \n        Chiswick House Conservatory built to a design by Samuel Ware in 1814 but altered in 1932 to 1933 and 2008 to 2010, is listed at Grade I for the following principal reasons:Architectural interest: *     \tas an early C19 fruit house which retains the original rear service range and a number of important early internal features, despite later replacement of the glazed timber superstructure;\n*     \tfor the surviving early C19 coal-fired furnaces and much of the hypocaust from the original heating system, as well as the large cisterns from the original water irrigation system, and the drying poles, all of which have been identified as unusual and important features that may now be the only such examples surviving, as well as the 1855 vaulted water tank and boiler pit;\n*     \tfor the architectural interest of the rear service range with its pedimented entrance and vaulted hall, as well as the conservatory interior with its tiered platform of 1855 and surviving ironwork;\n*     \tfor the relatively rare surviving features of the 1930s Messenger roofing system to be built on this scale, including the cast-iron mullions anchored to the masonry dwarf wall with cast-iron brackets holding the steel tension bars that allow the rafters to span across the conservatory, as well as the rods and gears to open the roof ventilators in banks.Historic interest *     \toriginally built in 1814 to the design of Samuel Ware, architect for the Burlington Arcade (Grade II-listed), as, what is thought to be, the earliest large glasshouse built; a forerunner of Decimus Burtonâs hothouse at Kew, and Sir Joseph Paxtonâs at Chatsworth and Crystal Palace, with the notable use of a central dome, and which retains the original rear service range and many internal features despite later replacement of the glazed timber superstructure to a similar design;\n*     \tas part of the Italian Garden at Chiswick House; one of the earliest formal gardens to come under that name, preceded only by one at Mount Edgcumbe, and, more generally, one of the earliest instances of the revival of formal gardens after the long reign of landscape gardens in England;\n*     \tas an early free-standing fruit house with a heating and irrigation system that was converted into an important showhouse for flowers from around 1828, following the importation of camellias from China, which is now one of the oldest collections under glass in Europe, as well as probably the largest such collection in Britain, and possibly outside China and Japan, within the Grade I-registered garden;\n*     \tthe 1930s replacement to the timber superstructure was probably the last large glasshouse built by Messenger and Company of which the glazing pattern and roofing system have been retained.Group value*     \tfor the strong group value with the Grade I-listed Chiswick House, the Grade I-registered Park and Garden and numerous designated structures in the gardens.\n    \n\n                    \n\n\n        \n            History\n        \n        \n            The property at Chiswick was occupied by a Jacobean house (demolished 1788) and associated formal gardens from the mid-C17. In about 1727 to 1729, a Palladian villa (the current house, Grade I-listed) was added alongside a scheme of formal gardens with the intention of re-creating the architecture and gardens of ancient Rome under Richard Boyle, the third earl of Burlington. Several further phases of extensive gardens were added during the C18, including the first ânaturalâ or landscaped gardens under Burlington and William Kent from 1733. William Cavendish, Sixth Duke of Devonshire, inherited the Chiswick estate in 1811 and acquired the adjacent property, then known as Moreton Hall (built in 1682 to 1864 for Sir Stephen Fox to the designs of Hugh May) the following year. The house was demolished, but its sequence of walled gardens were added to the Dukeâs estate and both gardens were thereby combined into a single site (Grade I-registered). The walled enclosures to its north were used as kitchen gardens while a new Italian Garden was laid out in the southern section (originally Foxâs pleasure garden), which was one of the earliest instances of the revival of formal gardens after the long reign of landscape gardens in England (Woudstra 2010, 111). It was one of the earliest formal gardens to come under the name âItalian Gardenâ, preceded only by one at Mount Edgcumbe (Ibid, 111). Such gardens were typically characterised by symmetry, formality and hardscaping with terraces supported by parapet walls on the coping of which vases might be placed, as well as geometric beds often planted with evergreens. The Italian Garden was laid out to the design of Lewis Kennedy in 1814. It included a 92m long conservatory designed by Samuel Ware, architect for the Burlington Arcade (Grade II-listed), and built at a cost of Â£15,000. The building was positioned to separate a kitchen garden and melon ground to the north from a semi-circular formal garden at the south. The conservatory stood on a raised terrace, in order to visually extend its height and act as a base, with a flight of steps at the centre and to each end leading to the south where there was a central gravel path flanked by hedges, with narrower paths behind them, in parallel, as well as a number of parterres filled with classical patterns. Kennedy declared his completed design as âunique in this style of gardening for beauty, grandeur and magnificenceâ (Ibid 114). When viewed from the terrace in summer, with all the plants filled out, it was subsequently said that there was ânothing of the kind in the neighbourhood of London at all equal to itâ (Edward Kemp, 1851, cited by Woudstra 2010, 117). The conservatory was a lean-to south-facing fruit house except for a glazed semi-circular central projection with a gilded dome containing stained glass (a detailed history of the building is set out in McLaren 2005). The building is thought to be the earliest large glasshouse built and was a forerunner of Decimus Burtonâs hothouse at Kew, and Sir Joseph Paxtonâs at Chatsworth and Crystal Palace (Burns 2011). It has been suggested that the use of the central dome was pioneering, marking a transition from kitchen garden glasshouse to elegant conservatory, and that the building was notable for pre-dating the invention of curvilinear wrought-iron glazing bars introduced in 1830 (LDA Design, Gazetteer, 46). Beneath the dome there was a fountain and basin containing exotic aquatic plants. The building was originally fitted with sliding sashes glazed with small panes of crown glass. This superstructure was supported on a purlin and iron posts at mid-point resting on stone plinths. Around the perimeter of the central dome were doors that could be opened to provide ventilation. The conservatory contained peach trees, grapevines and pineapples. In terms of layout, it comprised nine compartments: two pineries at each end, the central domed compartment, and three compartments in each wing. The divisions corresponded to the heating furnaces and flues and enabled different climates to be maintained in each compartment, allowing produce to ripen at successive times throughout the growing season (McLaren 2005, 15). Set behind the glasshouse at the north was the lean-to potting and storage range, probably including a bothy for the gardeners. The bottom of the central division wall was pierced with arches to take the roots of the peach trees through to the back sheds and into a long soil-filled narrow trench running at the foot of the wall (Ibid, 17). This allowed the roots to be contained in order to restrict growth, encouraging the production of fruit by placing the plant under pressure to propagate seeds (the fruit) for survival. The external front wall and front and back walls of the pineries, as well as the main south wall of the conservatory, were also pierced by arches to allow vine roots to be grown in external beds. All of the arches appear to remain in place, although partly infilled, today (2022). The vines were originally trained up the roof rafters internally. The original heating system comprised a network of hypocausts which were fed with warm air created by six coal-fired furnaces (three of which survive) located in the back range positioned beneath large water storage cisterns. There were two further furnaces heating the pineries, but these have been removed. The hypocaust flues ran around the planting beds and beneath the central basin under the dome, possibly also warming the water to increase the humidity to suit the exotic plants being grown there. This heating system consumed over 100 tons of coal per year at one point. Partial excavation has shown that hypocaust flues survive below-ground within the current building and are constructed of four courses of bricks set on edge with a tiled floor and capping. The rear service range contains large irrigation cisterns for the conservatory plants and the furnaces noted above and would have been used for drying and storing produce from the kitchen garden as well as potting and preparing crops for planting. The first five bays on each side were originally open to allow access for wagons and carts. Within the range are drying poles; detachable circular poles positioned horizontally between the trusses. At the south-west end of the range is also a brick vaulted water tank; its purpose is currently unknown but it may have fed the fountain in the Italian Garden. Camellias were planted in the conservatory (originally in pots) in 1828, which subsequently saw a change in use from a fruit house to a show house. They were imported by Chandler and Buckingham of Vauxhall at considerable cost from China and are one of the oldest collections under glass in Europe. Many of the original 40 varieties still survive (there were some 33 varieties in 2022), making the collection probably the largest in Britain and possibly outside of China and Japan (Burns 2021). It contains specimens of four of the earliest camellia varieties introduced into Europe:Â Camellia japonicaÂ (about 1739),Â C japonicaÂ âRubra Plenaâ (1794)Â C japonicaÂ âVariegataâ (1792) andÂ C japonicaÂ âAlba Plenaâ (1792) (Ibid). There is also the Middlemistâs Red, one of only two of this variety known to exist in the world; the other being in Waitangi, New Zealand. The variety was brought to Britain from China in 1804 by John Middlemist, a nurseryman from Shepherds Bush. In about 1855, a series of changes were made to the conservatory. The existing hypocaust heating system was replaced with a gravity-piped hot water system fed by boilers located in pits at each end of the back range; the hypocaust trenches appear to have been adapted to accommodate the cast-iron pipes. In conjunction with this, or before, most of the partitions of the compartments were removed. The small panel glazing was replaced with larger panes, probably using Hartleyâs Patent Rolled Plate; glass produced with finely combed grooves for diffusing the sunâs rays and preventing scorching to the plants (McLaren 2005, 57 and 59). Two platforms formed of stone flags to display pot plants were built replacing the vinery planting bed, at the front of the conservatory. The planting at this time is recorded as including: pelargoniums and azaleas to the platforms when in flower with a mixed collection the rest of the year; camellias and rhododendrons to the rear bed; acacias, passion-flowers, tacsonia and climbing plants on pillars along the walkways; a wisteria and a Rosa banksiae trained inside the dome, and camellias, rhododendrons, and a cluster of rarer plants in the beds below. There may have been some further works to the conservatory in 1895 (LDA Design 2004). The Chiswick House estate was let to a series of aristocratic tenants after 1862 before becoming a mental health institution or asylum from 1892 until 1929. The Italian Garden was re-arranged by the gardener Michael May in 1880 and the beds planted with herbaceous plants and annuals. In 1929, the estate was sold to Middlesex County Council and subsequently leased to Brentford and Chiswick Urban District Council for use as a public park. In 1932 to 1933, the glazed conservatory superstructure was replaced with a patent clear span post-tensioned steel and timber rafter system by Messenger and Company of Loughborough, with hinged ventilators in place of the sliding sashes and cast-iron mullions (Ibid 65). This was one of the last glasshouses built by the company, which had ceased this work by 1940, and was constructed at a cost of Â£2188 (Ibid 68). The overall form generally matched the previous superstructure but the detailing appears to have been simplified and the central semi-circular projection was rebuilt with a dome raised on a faceted drum. In 1941, the rear service range and north entrance porch suffered some damage during Second World War bombing and repairs were subsequently carried out. The Beatles filmed early music videos of their singles âPaperback Writerâ and âRainâ under the conservatory dome and gardens in May 1966. The conservatory underwent some like-for-like repairs in 1983 and there were some repairs to the dome in about 1990. The camellia collection was described as approaching âterminal declineâ in 1994 but was rehabilitated by volunteers from the International Camellia Society (McLaren 2005, 30). The glazed superstructure of the conservatory was replaced in 2008 to 2010, closely matching the 1930s glazing pattern and retaining the earlier iron and steelwork. The Italian Garden was also partly restored to the 1880 scheme at this time. Small-scale repairs were carried out to the conservatory in about 2020.\n\n        \n        \n            Details\n        \n        \n            Conservatory, built as a hothouse for fruit species in 1814, used as a show house for flowers by about 1828.

PLAN: one long glazed conservatory lean-to range with a semi-circular projection at the centre and pavilions at the ends separated by a central brick wall from a lean-to service range at the rear. The service range contains the original furnaces and cisterns that would have been used to heat and irrigate the hothouse.EXTERIOR: the conservatory is set on a south-east-facing terrace approached by stone steps and looking out onto an Italian Garden. It is orientated north-east to south-west. The building has a symmetrical glazed timber superstructure resting on a rendered brick dwarf wall, which is built as a lean-to against a substantial central brick wall separating it from a rear lean-to service range. The dwarf wall has a Portland stone plinth, cill and upstand over it. At the centre is a semi-circular projection with a facetted glazed roof surmounted by a glazed drum, dome and small lead cupola with a weathervane. The conservatory is entered at the south-east by a pair of central glazed doors and lit by a continuous band of nine-paned top-hung windows beneath a clerestory of small square leaded lights. Adjoining the central semi-circular projection is a lean-to with nine-paned windows, a clerestory of small square leaded lights, and a glazed roof. Set lower, and flanking it, are two long wings, each of 28 bays with a continuous band of three-light top-hung windows, small square clerestory lights and a glazed roof. Each wing has a projecting gabled porch at the centre of the south-east side with glazed double doors and glazed roofs. There are pavilions at each end, again set lower, which were formerly pineries with gabled porches. The rear elevation of the building is formed by the lean-to brick service range under a slate roof. This range has a central pedimented entrance containing a glazed double doorway with transom lights. It is rendered and applied with detailing to imitate ashlar masonry. The first five bays flanking this entrance on each side were originally open to allow access for wagons and carts. However, they have been infilled in weatherboarding with ribbon glazing and boarded doors, whilst three of the bays at the north-east are set back to form a covered walkway supported on modern columns. The remaining seven bays to each side of the rear range have three-light casement and fixed windows, some of which have further subsidiary bars, and a doorway containing a panelled door at each end. The top of the central brick wall has a lead flashing, concrete coping and cast-iron classical urns situated next to the chimneys. The rear service range is covered by a slate roof. INTERIOR: the glazed timber superstructure of the conservatory was replaced in 1932 to 1933 by Messenger and Co, and again in 2008 to 2010 closely matching the 1930s glazing pattern. However, the Messenger clear span roofing system, consisting of cast-iron mullions anchored to the masonry dwarf wall with cast-iron brackets holding the steel tension bars that allow the rafters to span across the conservatory, was retained and remains in place. The Messenger system of rods and gears to open the roof ventilators in banks, in order to reduce the time spent on opening and closing the ventilators, also remains in place. Many of these features are stamped with âMESSENGER & CO LTD LOUGHBOROUGHâ. These features, together with the overall form, design, and glazing pattern of the conservatory are all of a high degree of significance, although the current glass and fabric of the timberwork itself is of lesser interest given that it has essentially seen replacement as recently as 2008 to 2010 (with minor repairs in 2020). The main entrance to the conservatory leads into the central semi-circular projection, which has a flagstone and York stone paved floor in which are set some decorative cast-iron underfloor heating grates. Beneath the dome is a circular geometric pebble mosaic situated where the original basin containing exotic plants was positioned. There are ten cast-iron piers with moulded bases and capitals supporting the glazed drum and dome above. An arch leads through into a barrel-vaulted entrance hall at the centre of the rear range, which has a ceiling rose and an elaborate bed moulding decorated with anthemia, bead-and-reel and foliated decoration. The centre of the conservatory is flanked by long wings, which have York stone paved flooring and a flower bed containing the historic camellias next to the back wall which is rendered on this side. A two-tier paved platform, supported by moulded stone columns, chamfered stone piers and stone blocks, runs the length of the front wall. This would originally have been used to display pot plants. Beneath the lower platform are the large heating pipes* added in 1990, whilst elsewhere there is a modern lighting system* and associated electrical fixtures*; all of these features are not of special interest. The platforms continue into and around the walls of the former pinery compartment at the south-west end, which also has a York stone paved floor, trenches for the heating pipework (and possibly water collection) and decorative heating grates. The former pinery pavilion at the north-east has had the platforms removed, forming a single paved open space. Adjacent to the internal entrances to the pavilions are panelled historic doors with brass door furniture that lead into the rear range.The rear service range is currently (2022) used for volunteer activities and storage purposes at the south-west but has been converted to offices at the north-east end. This range has lean-to timber roof trusses and three of an original six brick and stone furnaces (or stoves) that heated the fruit house remaining in place. The furnaces have brick arches for openings (now bricked up) about 1.5m wide and were fed by coal to reach very high temperatures in order to induce a flow of hot air along the conservatory hypocausts. These ran through the partition wall, across the planting beds, and under the windows before returning to vertical flues that emerged through the chimneys. Positioned above the furnaces are large stone water storage cisterns originally used to irrigate the conservatory plants. These cisterns are 3.9m long, 1.9m wide and 0.8m deep. They may once have been fed from gutters collecting rainwater from the roof of the range.  This service range would originally have been used for drying and storing produce from the kitchen garden as well as preparing crops for planting. There are a few remaining circular wooden poles fixed between the roof trusses that appear to have been designed to store kitchen garden produce for drying and made detachable for cleaning. At the west end of the service range is a large brick vaulted water tank that was inserted in about 1855, cutting through one of the principal truss tie beams. It may originally have been used to feed the fountain in the Italian Garden. Next to this tank is a brick pit for the boiler, originally created in 1855, but now containing a modern boiler* installation which is not of special interest. The service range has a brick floor, partly laid in a herringbone pattern. The western part of this range has a stone tank next to one of the cisterns, a later inserted brick fireplace with a hob grate, and some weatherboarded partitions. The eastern part of the range has a staff room with modern kitchen units* and a disabled ramp*, toilets with modern sanitary ware*, and offices with two brick fireplaces, some inserted modern false floors* (above the earlier brick flooring), false ceilings* and a number of modern fixtures, fittings and services* which are not of special interest.EXCLUSIONS\n* Pursuant to s1 (5A) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (âthe Actâ) it is declared that these aforementioned structures and/or features are not of special architectural or historic interest. However, any works to these structures and/or features which have the potential to affect the character of the listed building as a building of special architectural or historic interest may still require Listed Building Consent (LBC) and this is a matter for the Local Planning Authority (LPA) to determine.\n\n        \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n    \n        Legacy\n    \n    \n        The contents of this record have been generated from a legacy data system.\n    \n    \n        \n            Legacy System number:\n            \n                202445\n            \n        \n        \n            Legacy System:\n            \n                LBS\n            \n        \n    \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n                    Sources\n                \n                \n                    Books and journalsClegg, G, Chiswick House and Gardens, (2011)Jacques, D, Chiswick House Gardens, (2022)Woudstra, J, 'The Italian Garden at Chiswick House' in English Heritage Historical Review, , Vol. 5, (2011), 110-130WebsitesBurns, A, Chiswick House and Gardens website: 2021 Camellia Collection â A History of our Collection., accessed 1 September 2022 from https://chiswickhouseandgardens.org.uk/2021/02/16/2021-camellia-celebration-a-history-of-our-collection/OtherEnglish Heritage Guidebook: Chiswick House and Gardens (1991)LDA Design, Chiswick House and Grounds Regeneration Project: Conservation Management Plan (2004)McLaren, I, The Conservatory, Chiswick House: A report on its history and development, 1812 to the present day, for English Heritage (2005)Museum of London Archaeology Service, Chiswick House Conservatory: An archaeological evaluation report (2005)West Scott Architects, Options Appraisal for Chiswick House Conservatory Repairs (April 2021)\n                \n\n\n\n                    \n                        \n\n\n    \n        Legal\n    \n\n\n    \n        This building is listed under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as amended for its special architectural or historic interest.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n\n            \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n            \n                Map\n            \n            \n                This map is for quick reference purposes only and may not be to scale.

    "wikipediaText": "St Mary's, Harrow on the Hill, is the Borough and Parish Church at Harrow on the Hill in northwest London, England. It is a Grade I-listed building.\n\n\n== History ==\nLanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, began the construction of a church on this site in 1087. He died in 1089. His successor was St Anselm, who at the age of 60 was enthroned â after considerable delay â as archbishop in September 1093.\nThe new church building, now completed and dedicated in the name of the Blessed Virgin Mary, was consecrated by St Anselm on 4 January 1094 (a most appropriate date, as at the time, 25 December was a more pagan festival and Christians kept the feast of the Epiphany or Old Christmas Day as it came to be called â as their principal feast of the birth of Christ).\nLittle of this original building remains apart from the lower section of the tower. The Chancel, with its fine arch and lancet windows, had been constructed by the end of the 12th century and this was followed by the rebuilding of the nave and the addition of the two transepts. The Rector of Harrow at this time was one Elias of Dereham (who was also involved in the building of Salisbury Cathedral) and it was he who appointed the first vicar, John de Holtune, about the year 1236.\nIn 1324, two chantries (small chapels endowed for the purpose of special prayer on behalf of their benefactors) were founded. One was the Chantry of St Michael in the free chapel of Tokyngton, which was situated about one and a half miles away in Wembley. The second was founded by the then rector, William de Bosco, ââto the honour of God and the Blessed Virgin Maryââ, and was in the present building. It had been assumed that this chantry was somewhere in the south transept, but recent investigations have convincingly suggested that it was over the south porch.\nThe small room, still there at the top of the staircase, contains evidence of Norman work, traces of colour decoration on the roof beams and a carved niche. John Byrkhede, himself a master builder, was appointed Rector of St Mary's in 1437, and died at Harrow in 1468. By 1450, the present clerestory windows, the nave and transept roofs, in the chancel and the upper stages of the tower with its famous spire, had been constructed. The roofs of the nave and transepts are reckoned to be the finest in Middlesex with 377 carvings, while the spire is covered with 12 tons of lead.\n400 years later, extensive restoration and renovation took place under George Gilbert Scott between 1846 and 1849. A parapet was added to the nave and aisle roofs, the north wall of the chancel was pulled down to enlarge the building, the east walls were rebuilt, the church building faced with flint and a vestry added to the north side. This vestry was further enlarged about the turn of the 20th century.\nA proposal in 1893 to build an organ at the south side of the chancel was abandoned when three Norman windows were uncovered, still showing decoration on the splays. The T.C.Lewis Company was commissioned to build a three manual organ which was completed in 1900. In 1932, Henry Willis & Co added new stops on the Great and Swell division. In 1970, Rushworth & Dreaper rebuilt the organ. B.C.Shepard of London electrified the stop action and Great/Swell organ division in 1991 and 1994. The Lewis console was modernised by David Wells of Liverpool in 1998.\n\nThe chancel roof, which had been renewed in the 18th century, was decorated in 1972 by Campbell Smith & Co.\nThere are thirteen ancient brasses in the church, mostly badly mutilated. The cope, to be seen in the North transept, was made for the 900th anniversary of the laying of the foundation stone, and the embroidered designs on this were copied from the mutilated brass of John Byrkhede in the chancel.\nThe brass to John Lyon, founder of Harrow School, and his wife, Joan, is on the wall of the nave, near his grave by the lectern. It has an interesting inscription in English. The gravestone on the floor, with a Latin inscription, was laid in 1875.\nLord Byron was a frequent visitor as a schoolboy from Harrow school, from 1801 to 1805, and he sat dreaming by \"his favourite tombstone\" (the \"Peachey Tomb\"), as recorded in \"Lines Written beneath an Elm in the Churchyard of Harrow\", which is reproduced on a memorial in front of the Peachey Tomb, erected by the son of one of Byron's school friends in 1905.  The Elm burnt down sometime prior to 1935. Byron's daughter Allegra Byron (by Clair Clairmont) is buried in an unmarked grave outside, very near to the south porch.\nThe old door into the north porch used to be on the south side and was moved to its present position by Gilbert Scott for better protection. The font, of Purbeck marble, and the chest in the north transept, like this door have been in use since 1200 â or even earlier. The pulpit is a good example of late 17th century woodcarving.\nThere are ten bells in the tower, the two smallest commemorating Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe church is at the top of Harrow Hill and views towards Central London and most other directions can be seen from the churchyard. It is the highest building in Middlesex. Notable buildings that can be seen are the buildings of Canary Wharf, and the BT Tower in Warren Street, some fourteen and nine miles respectively away from Harrow, and Wembley Stadium.\nThe church is often the icon of Harrow and can be seen from miles. Since WWI, it has been used as a navigational reference for aircraft approaching RAF Northolt.\n\n\n== Notable memorials ==\nThe church has memorials to:\n\nGeorge Butler, head master, 1805â1829\nJohn William Cunningham (1811â1861), vicar\nByron Drury (1815-1888), admiral\nJoseph Drury, Head Master, 1785â1805\nJames Edwards, bookseller\nWilliam Gerard, politician\nJohn Lyon, founder of Harrow School, and benefactor of the John Lyon School and the John Lyon's Charity\nGeoffrey Harold Woolley VC (1944â1952), vicar\nIn the north aisle are:\n\nJohn Henry North, politician\nWilliam Osgoode (1754-1824), first Chief Justice of Upper Canada (now Ontario, Canada)\n\n\n== Filming Location ==\nThe church features in some early scenes of the 2008 British science fantasy film Franklyn.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Parish and Borough Church of St Mary Harrow on the Hill, Diocese of London\nSt Mary's Church burial ground, Harrow on the Hill, Middlesex, England, Gravestone Photographic Resource\nChurch of St Mary, Harrow on the Hill, YouTube (30 July 2012)"

    "wikipediaText": "The Bower House () is a Grade I listed Palladian mansion in Havering-atte-Bower, England. It was built in 1729 by Henry Flitcroft, and was his first commission. The stable block was built at the same time and is separately grade I listed. Landscape architect Charles Bridgeman designed the grounds and possibly the stable block. The mansion incorporated architectural items salvaged from the ruined Havering Palace. The staircase features murals by James Thornhill.\nIt remained a private home until 1976 when it was purchased by the Ford Motor Company. It is currently used as a Christian training centre. The house forms part of the Open House London festival.\n\n\n== References =="

    "wikipediaText": "Boone's Chapel is a single-storey building attributed to Sir Christopher Wren and built in 1683. The chapel is very small, measuring just 45 square metres and is constructed of red brickwork with Portland stone details to window architraves, rusticated quoins and a pyramidal roof with an open wood cupola. The chapel is listed Grade I on the National Heritage List for England.\nIt is located adjacent to the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors almshouses on Lee High Road in Lewisham, London and is one of only two Grade I-listed buildings in the borough of Lewisham (the other is St Paul's, Deptford).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nChristopher Boone, a member of the Merchant Taylorsâ Company, commissioned Sir Christopher Wren to design the chapel.  The Boone family lived in Herefordshire and income from their estate was used to build almshouses for the elderly of Lee and also to educate twelve poor children.\nThough Wren may have been commissioned to build both the chapel and almshouses, it appears that Robert Hooke, a friend and colleague and another member of the Merchant Taylorsâ Company, actually undertook construction.\nAlthough the almshouses that were built to the left of the chapel along Lee High Road were demolished in 1877, the chapel itself was preserved as a reading room. There are remaining Grade II-listed almhouses dating from 1825 just up from the chapel. Following the end of the second world war, the chapel fell into disuse.\n\n\n=== Mausoleum ===\n\nBoth Christopher Boone (1616-1686) and his wife, Mary (c1638-1722) are interred within the chapel.\n\n\n== Restoration ==\nBy the late 1990s, the Grade I-listed chapel was suffering from decades of neglect and was placed on English Heritage's London Buildings at Risk register. To combat this, a new charity was set up - The Blackheath Historic Buildings Trust - in 1999.\nThe charity received Heritage Lottery Funding and support from the London Borough of Lewisham, livery companies and  the support of  local residents through the Lee Manor and Blackheath Societies. The funding allowed for the chapel to be completely renovated.\nFollowing the raising of over Â£500,000, Boone's Chapel was renovated in 2008. A small physic garden was also added during the renovation.\nThe chapel is now used by a firm of architects but is open to the public 30 days a year.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBoone's Chapel website\nThe Blackheath Historic Buildings Trust\nRestoration video of Boone's Chapel on YouTube"

Restored in 1856 by J Whichcord, and several times in the C20.MATERIALS\nBrick, faced in Portland stone ashlar, exposed brick in crypt. Lead roofs.PLAN\nCruciform externally but suppressed to appear as a rectangular block with an E apse, W semi-circular Doric portico and round tower, and wide three bay pedimented N and S projections (the interior is also cruciform but again suppressed, particularly by the heavy cornice to the central space, to give the clear impression of a central rectangle with subsidiary side spaces) . Raised on a wide, integral stone terrace all the way around, with staircases to N, S and W. Crypt below whole church.EXTERIOR\nA large and magnificent church in a strongly modelled Classical style of the kind referred to as English Baroque, heavily Doric externally. Rusticated pilasters and recessed round arched windows with triple keystones throughout, with lunette windows over the doors and lighting the staircases at the W end. The W apse rises above a half-round staircase and is surrounded by a monumental semi-circular Doric portico,derived from the semi-circular porches of the north and south transepts of St Paul's Cathedral but ultimately from the half-oval porch Pietro da Cortona designed as part of the faÃ§ade to the church of St Maria della Pace in Rome (1656-57) which Archer, unlike Wren, may have seen. The portico supports a tall, slender round tower of two stages with a two stage polygonal spire. The E apse has a Venetian window following the curve and a pediment. The N and S transeptal projections have pediments with lunettes and central doorways leading to balustraded symmetrical staircases with access to the crypt below the central terrace. Exterior very little altered, and powerfully conceived throughout.INTERIOR\nThe power of the exterior extends to the fine and dignified classical interior, typical of the English Baroque in its sophisticated but muted central plan, its rich architecture and luxuriant plasterwork. It retains its original galleries and hugely rich plasterwork mouldings relatively unaltered, although the floor levels at the E end were raised in 1895. C18 painted decorative scheme in the apse, excellently restored in the early C21. Round entrance vestibule with curved staircases to the galleries. Giant Corinthian columns support a richly moulded entablature around the nave and apse, with the panelled oak galleries on the N and S sides suspended behind the columns. The corners are cut off diagonally and glazed internally to form vestries in the eastern angles and space for the gallery staircases in the western angles. Projecting inwards from each canted angle at gallery level is a box gallery on Corinthian columns of oak. The W organ gallery is higher than the side galleries and stands on paired fluted Corinthian columns. The brick crypt is vaulted and is very similar to that in Archer's St John's Smith Square. PRINCIPAL FIXTURES\nOutstanding plasterwork ceilings by James Hands. C18 painted decoration in the E apse was restored in the early C21 following fire damage. An unusual painted window of 1813 by William Collins has been reset from the E end in the internal window of the NW gallery box pew. The bombe-shaped pulpit was cut down from its original three-decker arrangement in 1873, at which date the tester was also removed. It retains part of its C18 wrought iron stairs. Similar C18 railings and gates, probably part of the former communion rails, are stored in the S gallery. Some box pews survive at the W end beneath the organ gallery.The nave and gallery benches were cut down in the C19 from the C18 box pews. C19 neo-Romanesque font brought from Rochester cathedral. Some good C18 and early C19 monuments, including Matthew Ffinch d.1745; Vice-Admiral James Sayer, d. 1776 by Nollekens, and Dr Charles Burney, d.1817.SUBSIDIARY FEATURES\nThe churchyard boundary wall on the S side contains significant amounts of C18 and early C19 brick, especially at its eastern end. HISTORY\nSt Paul's is one of the churches built by the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches, set up by Act of Parliament in 1711 and funded by a tax on coal coming into London. The Fifty New Churches Act was intended to provide additional church accommodation is areas of rapid urban growth such as Deptford, the site of one of the Royal Navy's most important dockyards. Its architect, Thomas Archer, was one of the Commissioners. He had travelled abroad between 1686 and 1689, almost certainly to Germany, Austria and Italy, which is often held to account for his knowledge of Roman and Viennese Imperial Baroque, of its features and use of space, though his buildings are generally tempered by the same fondness for simple but expansive and rich classical effects which characterise Hawksmoor and Vanbrugh's buildings. In this, St Paul's is part of the wider International Late Baroque, in common with works by Fontana and Juvarra in Italy, Fischer von Erlach and Hildebrandt in Vienna and Hardouin-Mansart in France. In particular, Archer in this church shared the same interest in suppressed central planning and cross axes which can be seen in Hawksmoor's churches for the Commission. He also designed St Philip Birmingham, now Birmingham Cathedral (1710-15, prior to the Commission; tower, 1725) and, for the Commission, St John's Smith Square, Westminster (1713-28). The plans for the church were drawn up in 1712, work began in 1713 and the building was largely complete by 1720, but some work continued until 1730. It was restored in 1856 by J Whichcord, in 1883 by T Dinwiddy, and several times in the C20 and early C21, but with the exception of the furnishings, which were remodelled in the C19, retains much of its original appearance. Something of the richness of the Commission churches, compared to Wren's City churches of forty years previously, is that the major ones cost as much as ten times the average cost of a Wren City church. The inventive triangular parsonage was also designed by Archer but was demolished c.1885 (illustration see K Downes, op. cit, fig. 46 and p. 101).SOURCES\nDownes, K., English Baroque Architecture (1966), 96-101, 399, 402 and 422.\nPevsner, N and Cherry, B., Buildings of England, London 2 South (2002), 403-4REASONS FOR DESIGNATION\nThe church of St Paul, Deptford, is designated at Grade I for the following principal reasons:\n*\tOutstanding early C18 parish church, one of the finest achievements of Thomas Archer, in style English Baroque but lent interest by memories of the Roman and the Imperial Baroque characteristic of its author.

    "wikipediaText": "St Paul's, Deptford, is one of London's finest Baroque parish churches, cited as \"one of the most moving C18 churches in London\" in the Buildings of England series. It was designed by gentleman architect Thomas Archer and built between 1712 and 1730 in Deptford, which was then a settlement in Kent but is now part of South East London.  It was one of the 50 churches that were to be built by the New Church Commissioners, although only 12 were ultimately constructed. With St John's, Smith Square, it was one of two churches designed by Archer to be built under the Act.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Construction ===\n\nWith rising urban growth in Deptford (mainly made up of literate, skilled workers tending to dissent from the established church), the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches decided to counter this drift away from the established Anglican communion by building a major new Church of England church in the area. To this end they appointed Thomas Archer, one of their fellow commissioners, to design a church in Deptford. Archer also designed St John's Smith Square and Birmingham Cathedral. He began almost immediately, designing it in his usual Roman Baroque style and completing the fabric and most of the decoration by 1720 (though work continued until its consecration in 1730). The church was built by Edward Strong the Younger a friend of Christopher Wren the Younger.\nThe Rectory also designed by Archer, was demolished, ca 1886.\n\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nIn the 1970s a basement room at the church, known as 'The Crypt', was used as a reggae club. By the mid-1980s it was a regular venue for all-night psychedelic rock revival concerts and club nights. Colin Jerwood of the anarcho-punk band Conflict would also put on gigs there.\nIn May 2000 the church was damaged by a fire. The structural damage was confined to the east end, where much of the stained glass was lost and the joinery and decorative finishes were badly charred. The whole of the interior, including the organ case, was blackened by smoke.\n\n\n== Architecture and Features ==\n\nThe church is built from Portland stone, and, as with most of these churches, it is raised on a crypt that is mostly above ground, thus needing a flight of stairs to enter. The most unusual feature of the building is the cylindrical tower with a steeple, around which is wrapped a semi-circular portico of four giant Tuscan columns; colossal pilasters articulate the body of the church facades. The steeple embedded in the plane of the church wall echoes the apse at the east end. It was an afterthought, which required structural strengthening of the underpinnings of the west end. The body of the church is approximately square in plan, with its pedimented roof set transversely. Two additional, liturgically and practically unnecessary side entrances in the middle of the walls, each approached by a grand divided symmetrical staircase, suited to a Palladian villa. The east wall has a projecting apse.\nThe interior has two side aisles each separated by two giant Corinthian columns, which continue as attached columns on the other walls. There are side galleries supported by the giant columns, with an organ gallery above the entrance. The east window is in the form of a Venetian window but following the curve of the apse, \"a very Baroque trait, no doubt indulged in by Archer on the precedent of Vanbrugh's licenses\" Sir Nikolaus Pevsner observed. This is articulated by small Tuscan columns.\nThe tower contains three bells, originally hung for change ringing but long since unringable. These were all cast at various stages, by the Whitechapel bell foundry: the tenor is the oldest bell, and was cast in 1772.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nParish website\nParish history\nSt Paul's Deptford Church Development Project"

Late C12 with later alterations, widened c1758 and in 1852.Nos.12 and 14 High Street, which project over and abut the south-western arch of the medieval bridge, are not included in the listing.\n    \n\n                    \n\n\n    \n        Reasons for Designation\n    \n    \n        Clattern Bridge, late C12 with later alterations, widened c1758 and in 1852 is listed at Grade I for the following principal reasons: * Structural interest: a triple-arched C12 stone bridge at the southern approach to the medieval town, widened and thereby enclosing a C18 core behind a C19 eastern face;  * Historic interest: the continued use of the river crossing from at least the Saxon period, where it crosses the Hogsmill River, which was an important watercourse from the Roman to the post-medieval period, and site of the industrial quarter and wharfs.\n\n    \n\n                    \n\n\n        \n            History\n        \n        \n            Kingston upon Thames, historically in Surrey, was an important market town, port and river crossing from the early medieval period, while there is evidence of Saxon settlement and of activity dating from the prehistoric period and of Roman occupation. It is close to the important historic royal estates at Hampton Court, Bushy Park, Richmond and Richmond Park. The old core of the town, around All Saints Church (C14 and C15, on an earlier site) and Market Place, with its recognisably medieval street pattern, is âthe best preserved of its type in outer Londonâ (Pevsner and Cherry, London: South, 1983 p.307). Kingston thrived first as an agricultural and market town and on its historic industries of malting, brewing and tanning, salmon fishing and timber exporting, before expanding rapidly as a suburb after the arrival of the railway in the 1860s. In the later C19 it become a centre of local government, and in the early C20 became an important shopping and commercial centre. Its rich diversity of buildings and structures from all periods reflect the multi-facetted development of the town.Â  In the late 12th century, the Saxon âClatrung Bridgeâ was replaced by a new bridge crossing the Hogsmill River. In 1758 the Court of Assembly voted towards 'widening and enlarging Clattering Bridge'. The brick parapet was taken down to road level, and the bridge was extended southwards by three red brick arches 7m wide. These were built beside the existing stone arches, and bonded into them, a brick parapet was raised on the southern side of the bridge, and one footpath was constructed. In 1852, the bridge was still further widened on the southern side by the addition of three more arches. At the same time an ornamental railing was set up in place of the brick parapet, and this further enlarged bridge became known as Clattern Bridge.\n\n        \n        \n            Details\n        \n        \n            Bridge over the Hogsmill River. Late C12 with later alterations, widened  c1758 and in 1852. Materials: stone rubble and flint, brick, stone ashlar facing and dressings.The north side of the bridge comprises three slightly stilted C12 stone arches, each built of  two courses of ashlar above which is rubble and flint filling. The upper part and parapet is an 18th century addition and is of red brick with stone coping, which rises to a central panel above which is the base of an octagonal stone shaft. The south side of the bridge was extended in the 18th and 19th centuries. The C19 south face of the bridge has three round arches in brick with stone dressings, and is articulated by stone half columns with cubic capitals, each surmounted by a column with a scallop capital. Between the columns, which form the parapet, are cast iron railings with alternating columnar shafts and two tiers of cusped circles. There are repaired or added cutwaters on the south side.The bridge is also designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument (NHLE 1002021)\n\n        \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n    \n        Legacy\n    \n    \n        The contents of this record have been generated from a legacy data system.\n    \n    \n        \n            Legacy System number:\n            \n                203119\n            \n        \n        \n            Legacy System:\n            \n                LBS\n            \n        \n    \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n\n\n\n                    \n                        \n\n\n    \n        Legal\n    \n\n\n    \n        This building is listed under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as amended for its special architectural or historic interest.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n\n            \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n            \n                Map\n            \n            \n                This map is for quick reference purposes only and may not be to scale.

    "wikipediaText": "The Clattern Bridge is a bridge over the Hogsmill River in Kingston upon Thames.  It was built around 1175 and is thus one of the oldest intact bridges in England. It replaced an older Saxon bridge which was known as the Clatrung Bridge. Its various names, such as the Clateryngbrugge, are thought to derive from the clattering of horses' hooves as they crossed the bridge. The bridge still carries a full load of modern vehicle traffic.\nUp to the 18th century, the bridge was used as a site for the ducking of scolds with a cucking stool.  The bridge also featured in the traditional game of football held in the centre of Kingston each year on Shrove Tuesday. It was the goal for one of the teams, while the nearby Kingston Bridge was the other goal.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nThe bridge was constructed around 1175, during the Norman era, replacing an earlier Saxon bridge. The lower portion consists of three arches made of properly dressed ashlar stones with a filling of flint rubble. In 1758, the local authority, which was then the Kingston Court of Assembly, agreed to widen the bridge.  The addition was made of red brick which was bonded into the existing stone arches.  Brick parapets were built and these were capped with stone.  In 1852, the bridge was widened again with the addition of more brick-built structure.  An ornamental railing was added at this time.  This structure is considered quite sound and continues to bear a full load of traffic.  It was scheduled as an ancient monument on 16 February 1938 and its structure is now Grade I listed.\nIn 2012, a zoological survey found that eels were having difficulty migrating upstream under the bridge, because of the fast flow of water across the smooth surface under the bridge. Tiles were fixed to the river bed with protrusions so that the eels could wriggle up them to pass the bridge and eels are now found upstream on the Hogsmill.\n\n\n== Traditions ==\n \nScolds were ducked at the bridge, using a cucking stool.  Kingston was still doing this as late as 1745 when the landlady of the Queen's Head was ducked before a large crowd.\nA traditional game of football was held each year for centuries in Kingston.  Men of the town would meet at the Druid's Head on Shrove Tuesday and then the two teams â the Townsend and the Thames-Street â would compete to get the ball to one of the two goals: the great bridge over the Thames or the Clattern Bridge.  William Biden tells that this started with an 8th-century dispute between rivals Kenulf and Kynard.  In the late 18th century, the authorities tried to suppress the game on account of its violence and disruption of the town's trade.  The Riot Act was read in 1798 and the cavalry at Hampton Court was sent for but did not respond as they were playing football too.  The game was finally displaced from the public highway in 1867, when the authorities managed to move the game to a local playing field.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nClattern Bridge, Historic England, 30 March 2015\nBiden, William Downing (1852), The History and Antiquities of the Ancient and Royal Town of Kingston-upon-Thames, William Lindsey\nSampson, June (1972), The story of Kingston, Michael Lancet\nPratt, Derek (2015), Great Waterways Journeys, Bloomsbury, ISBN 9781472905840\nAtkinson, Ken (1997), Highway Maintenance Handbook, Thomas Telford, ISBN 9780727725318\nMalcolmson, Robert (1979), Popular Recreations in English Society 1700â1850, CUP Archive, ISBN 9780521295956\nPecorelli; Humble; Barker; Mowat; Debney (26 November 2013), European Eel Project Report 2013 (PDF), Zoological Society of London\nEel Passage on the Hogsmill, South East Rivers Trust, 12 December 2016"

The stone and its enclosure have stood at their present location since 1935.    \n\n                    \n\n\n    \n        Reasons for Designation\n    \n    \n        The Coronation Stone is listed at Grade I for the following principal reasons:Historic interest:  \n*  the stone has traditionally been associated with a legend, probably dating from the late C18, that Saxon kings were seated on a stone to be crowned in Kingston in the C10;\n*  it helps to tell the story of Kingston as a place with ancient royal connections.Architectural interest:\n*  it is a good example of a C19 commemorative public monument, with an attractive enclosure enriched by Saxon-style railings and a seven-side plinth that allude to the stoneâs traditional association with the coronation of seven C10 Saxon kings.Group value: \n*  with the adjacent Grade I listed and scheduled Clattern Bridge and the nearby Grade II listed Guildhall.\n\n    \n\n                    \n\n\n        \n            History\n        \n        \n            Kingston upon Thames, historically in Surrey, was an important market town, port and river crossing from the early medieval period, while there is evidence of Saxon settlement and of activity dating from the prehistoric period and of Roman occupation. It is close to the important historic royal estates at Hampton Court, Bushy Park, Richmond and Richmond Park. The old core of the town, around All Saints Church (C14 and C15, on an earlier site) and Market Place, with its recognisably medieval street pattern, is âthe best preserved of its type in outer Londonâ (Pevsner and Cherry, London: South, 1983 p. 307). Kingston thrived first as an agricultural and market town and on its historic industries of malting, brewing and tanning, salmon fishing and timber exporting, before expanding rapidly as a suburb after the arrival of the railway in the 1860s. In the later C19 it become a centre of local government, and in the early C20 became an important shopping and commercial centre. Its rich diversity of buildings and structures from all periods reflect the multi-facetted development of the town.The Coronation Stone (or Kingâs Stone) is an ancient sarsen stone traditionally said to have been used for the coronation of seven Anglo-Saxon kings in the C10. Historic evidence shows that at least two kings certainly were crowned in Kingston: Athelstan (925) and Aethelred the Unready (979), and there is some evidence to suggest Eadred (946) was also. The other four kings traditionally believed to have been crowned there are Edward the Elder (900), Edmund (940), Edwy (955) and Edward (975). Modern historians also think that Edgar was crowned in Kingston in 959. Athelstan is said to have been the first king to wear a crown (as opposed to a helmet) and is considered by modern historians to be the first King of all England. His coronation on 4 September 925 in Kingston, close to the border of the old kingdoms of Wessex and Mercia, laid the foundations for modern coronation ceremonies: he first greeted people in the market place before entering a church to be crowned. Local legend has it that Athelstan and other kings were seated upon a stone within the church for their coronations. The C10 church may have been the Saxon Minster Church, which would perhaps have been built of timber with an adjacent chapel.Antiquaries including John Leland and John Aubrey do not mention a stone or refer to any traditions regarding a coronation stone in their writings about Kingston. The earliest record of a stone possibly matching the description of the present Coronation Stone is in the Court of Assembly (equivalent to a local council) minute book for 1703, which refers to a âsmooth square stone in Court Hallâ in the Market Place. At some point that stone, which had become an encumbrance, is said to have been moved into St Maryâs Chapel or just outside it, a late Saxon building that stood close to the site of the present All Saints Church. Another theory is that the stone now celebrated as the Coronation Stone had been used as building material in St Maryâs. In 1730 the chapel collapsed when graves were being dug inside it, killing the Sexton. His daughter, Hesther Hammerton, miraculously survived and was pulled from the rubble, apparently along with the stone according to some sources. The notion that the recovered stone was in fact the one associated with the C10 coronations is disputed by modern historians (e.g. Butters, 2013), but by 1793 the sixth edition of The Ambulator, a London guidebook, was describing that stone as the one upon which the Saxon kings were crowned. Historians speculate that it then remained in the churchyard for some time before being placed in 1825 outside the Elizabethan Guildhall in the Market Place, where it was used as a public mounting block. Around 1838 when the Guildhall was rebuilt as the current Market House, it was relocated to the Assize Courts to be used as a mounting block by county magistrates.Eventually in 1849 Henry Haughton Young of Leamington Spa, an antiquarian, noticed the neglected stone and encouraged the town council to move it to a position more suited to its supposed legendary status. Frederick Gould, Samuel Ranyard and Charles Fenner subsequently led a campaign to preserve the stone for posterity. The council appointed a committee who selected a proposal by Mr C E Davis of Bath. In 1850 the stone was re-erected at the south end of the Market Place, set in a seven-sided granite plinth and surrounded by seven âSaxon styleâ stone piers with iron railings, according to Davisâs proposal. The heptagonal design was an allusion to the seven kings thought to have been crowned on the stone, their names and coronation dates inscribed on the plinth along with a coin from each of their reigns. The project was part funded by the committee with the remainder by private donations. The town declared a public holiday on 19 September 1850 for the stoneâs official inauguration âwith Masonic honoursâ. Thousands flocked to Kingston to watch a procession by the Mayor, the Corporation, and the Freemasons of Surrey, which culminated with the Provincial Grand Master anointing the stone with corn, oil and wine. Afterwards there was a public meal followed by poetry, music, a presentation of commemorative medals, aquatic sports and fireworks.The Coronation Stone was moved (along with the 1850 plinth and enclosure) to its present site next to the new Guildhall around 1935 following the demolition of Clattern House and the Assizes Court. The stone has continued to be a focus for public pageantry, and in 2022 it was restored with a new interpretation board installed to mark the Platinum Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II.The name âKingstonâ derives from the Old English âCyninges-tunâ, meaning royal estate or enclosure. A local legend (perhaps perpetuated by the Victorians) that the Kingâs Stone gave the town its name has been refuted. Kingstonâs royal association first appears in the record of King Egbertâs Great Council held there in 838, well before the stone is thought to have been used in coronations at Kingston.\n\n        \n        \n            Details\n        \n        \n            An ancient sarsen stone, traditionally said to have been used for the coronation of Saxon kings in the C10, with a plinth and enclosing railings and piers of 1850. The Coronation Stone and its enclosure have stood at their present location since 1935.MATERIALS: the Coronation Stone is an unhewn block of hard sandstone or sarsen stone. It is set within a two-tier plinth of mixed limestone and concrete composition, with the base rendered with lime and cementitious mortar. It is surrounded by cast iron railings and rendered piers with Caen stone capitals, with various lime and cement mortar repairs. Some of these repairs probably date from 1920 and 1935, with more repairs carried out as part of the 2022 restoration work.PLAN & DESCRIPTION: the approximately one-metre-high block of stone is set within a two-tier heptagonal plinth, which bears the names of the seven kings to each of its chamfered edges, with the dates of their coronations on the vertical faces below. These inscriptions are in lead with Anglo-Saxon lettering for the names and Roman numerals for the dates. There is a small, circular indentation beneath each name, which is presumably where the coins from each monarchâs reign were placed, although these are now obscured. The Stone and the plinth are surrounded by seven piers, originally of Purbeck stone, but now apparently replaced or covered with concrete, probably due to damage that occurred during a motor accident in 1920 as well as the monumentâs relocation in 1935. These piers are of circular section and are set in chamfered, heptagonal bases. They are capped with carved capitals, each of a unique design, and conical, scalloped hoods, all of Caen stone but patched with cement and lime mortar. These are topped with painted spearhead finials probably of cast iron and of varying quality. The piers are linked by painted, iron railings in the form of intersecting round-headed arches, with cubic capitals below, resting upon spiked circles. Some of these details resemble those of the railings on the south side of the adjacent Clattern Bridge.\n\n        \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n    \n        Legacy\n    \n    \n        The contents of this record have been generated from a legacy data system.\n    \n    \n        \n            Legacy System number:\n            \n                203121\n            \n        \n        \n            Legacy System:\n            \n                LBS\n            \n        \n    \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n                    Sources\n                \n                \n                    Books and journalsButters, S, 'That Famous Place' a history of Kingston upon Thames, (2013), 38-44, 263-5Malden, H E, The Victoria History of the County of Surrey: Volume III, (1911), 487M Blockley, The Kingston Coronation Stone (May 2010), accessed from https://issuu.com/kevinjdavis/docs/coronation_stone 22 February 2023.Hawkins, D, 'Anglo-Saxon Kingston: a shifting pattern of settlement' in The London Archaeologist, , Vol. 8:10, (1998), 271-278WebsitesWhere England Began, accessed 22 February 2023 from https://www.allsaintskingston.co.uk/heritage/where-england-began\n                \n\n\n\n                    \n                        \n\n\n    \n        Legal\n    \n\n\n    \n        This building is listed under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as amended for its special architectural or historic interest.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n\n            \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n            \n                Map\n            \n            \n                This map is for quick reference purposes only and may not be to scale.

    "wikipediaText": "The Coronation Stone is an ancient sarsen stone block which is believed to have been the site of the coronation of seven Anglo-Saxon kings. It is currently located next to the Guildhall in Kingston upon Thames, England. Kingston is now a town in the Royal Borough of Kingston Upon Thames in Greater London.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nIn Old English, tun, ton or don meant farmstead or settlement, so the name Kingston appears to mean farmstead of the kings. A local legend that these Saxon coronations gave Kingston its name is contradicted by the records of the 838 council.\n\n\n== History ==\nÃthelstan was consecrated king at Kingston in 925, Eadred in 946 and Ãthelred the Unready in 979. There is also some evidence that Edward the Elder, Edmund I, Eadwig and Edward the Martyr were consecrated in the town.\n\nAccording to John Stow, writing in the late sixteenth century, Ãthelstan was crowned on a stage in the market place, but it was later believed that the kings were crowned in the ancient church of St Mary, which collapsed in 1730. A large stone block was recovered soon afterwards from the ruins of the chapel, and it has since been regarded as the \"Coronation Stone\" of the Kings of the English. It was used for a time in the late 18th century to the early 19th century as a mounting block, but in 1850 it was placed in the market place on a plinth in front of the old Town Hall (on the site now occupied by the 'Market House' today). which had the names of the seven kings believed to have been crowned on it inscribed around the side.\n\n\n== Future plans ==\nIn 2017, Kingston Council was considering an option of re-siting the coronation stone from the Guildhall's frontage back to its original location within the churchyard of Kingston's old parish church, All Saints' Church.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of individual rocks\nBlarney Stone (Ireland)\nStone of Scone (Scotland)\nDuke's Chair (Austria)\nEdward Faraday Odlum\nHistory of Scotland\nLia FÃ¡il (Ireland)\nOmphalos\nPrince's Stone (Slovenia)\nStone of Jacob\nStones of Mora (Sweden)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBell, William (1858). \"The Kingston Morasteen\" .

    "wikipediaText": "Osterley Park is a Georgian country estate in west London, which straddles the London boroughs of Ealing and Hounslow. Originally dating from the 1570s, the estate contains a number of Grade I and II listed buildings, with the park listed as Grade II*. The main building (Osterley House) was remodelled by Robert Adam between 1761 and 1765. The National Trust took charge of Osterley in 1991, and the house and park are open to visitors.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe original building on this site was a manor house built in the 1570s for banker Sir Thomas Gresham, who purchased the manor of Osterley in 1562. The \"faire and stately brick house\" was completed in 1576. It is known that Elizabeth I visited. The stable block from that period remains at Osterley Park. Gresham, the founder of the Royal Exchange, also bought the neighbouring Manor of Boston in 1572.\n\n\n=== Acquisition by the Child family ===\nDuring the late 17th century, the estate was owned by Nicholas Barbon, a developer who mortgaged it to Child's Bank and then died in debt around 1698. As a result of a mortgage default, by the early 1710s, the estate came into the ownership of Sir Francis Child, the founder of Child's Bank. In 1761, Sir Francis's grandsons, Francis and Robert, employed Scottish architect Robert Adam (who was just emerging as one of the most fashionable architects in Britain) to remodel the house. When Francis Child died in 1763, the project was taken up by his brother and heir, Robert Child, for whom the interiors were created.\nThe house is of red brick with white stone details and is approximately square, with turrets in the four corners. Adam's design, which incorporates some of the earlier structure, is highly unusual, and it differs greatly in style from the original construction. One side is left almost open and is spanned by an Ionic pedimented screen, which is approached by a broad flight of steps and leads to a central courtyard, which is at piano nobile level.\n\nAdam's neoclassical interiors are among his most notable sequences of rooms. Horace Walpole described the drawing room as \"worthy of Eve before the fall\". The rooms are characterised by elaborate but restrained plasterwork, rich, highly varied colour schemes, and a degree of coordination between decor and furnishings unusual in English neoclassical interiors. Notable rooms include the entrance hall, which has large semi-circular alcoves at each end, and the Etruscan dressing room, which Adam said was inspired by the \"Etruscan\" vases (as they were then regarded, now recognised as Greek) in Sir William Hamilton's collection, illustrations of which had recently been published. Adam also designed some of the furniture, including the opulent domed state bed, which is still in the house.\n\n\n=== After Robert Child ===\nRobert Child's only daughter, Sarah, married John Fane, 10th Earl of Westmorland, in 1782. When Child died two months later, his will placed his vast holdings, including Osterley, in trust for any second-to-be born grandchild. This proved to be Lady Sarah Fane, who was born in 1785.\nChild's will kept his property out of the hands of John Fane, his son-in-law. Under the doctrine of coverture then in force, if Child had given his daughter more than a life interest in any property, Fane would have had control of it. Fane had eloped with Child's daughter to Gretna Green, as Child had not consented to the marriage. Child had wished his daughter to marry someone willing to take on the Child surname and ensure its continuation.\nChild's eventual heiress, Lady Sarah Fane, married George Villiers in 1804 and, having children, the estate passed into the Villiers family. In 1819, George Villiers changed his surname to Child Villiers.\n\n\n=== Later history ===\n\nGeorge Child Villiers, 9th Earl of Jersey, opened Osterley to the public in 1939 after having received many requests from people wishing to see its historic interior. He justified his decision by saying that it was \"sufficient answer that he did not live in it and that many others wished to see it\". Some 12,000 people visited the house during its first month of opening. Villiers staged a series of exhibitions of artworks by living artists in the top-floor rooms to contrast with the 18th-century interiors on the ground floor. He also planned to create an arboretum in the grounds, although that never came to fruition.\n\n\n==== Home Guard training establishment ====\nThe grounds of Osterley Park were used for the training of the first members of the Local Defence Volunteers (forerunners of the Home Guard) when the 9th Earl, a friend of publisher Edward George Warris Hulton, allowed writer and military journalist Captain Tom Wintringham to establish the first Home Guard training school (which Hulton sponsored) at the park in MayâJune 1940. It included teaching the theory and practice of modern mechanical warfare, guerilla-warfare techniques and street-fighting techniques, making use of some estate workers' houses that had been scheduled for demolition.\nPainter Roland Penrose taught camouflaging here, an extension of work he had developed with the paintbrush in avant-garde paintings to protect the modesty of his lover, Elizabeth 'Lee' Miller (married to Aziz E. Bey). Maj. Wilfred Vernon taught the art of mixing home-made explosives, and his explosives store can still be seen at the rear of the house, while Canadian Bert \"Yank\" Levy, who had served under Wintringham in the Spanish Civil War, taught knife fighting and hand-to-hand combat. Despite winning world fame in newsreels and newspaper articles around the world (particularly in the US), the school was disapproved of by the War Office and Winston Churchill, and it was taken over in September 1940. Closed in 1941, its staff and courses were reallocated to other newly opened War Office-approved Home Guard schools.\n\n\n==== National Trust ====\nAfter the Second World War, Lord Jersey approached Middlesex County Council, which had shown interest in buying the estate, but eventually decided to give the house and its park to the National Trust. The furniture was sold to the Victoria & Albert Museum. In 1947, Lord Jersey moved to the island of Jersey, taking with him many pictures from the collection at Osterley. Some were destroyed in a warehouse fire on the island soon after. Lord Jersey assisted the Ministry of Works and the V&A in their restoration of the house to its present late-18th-century state.\nThe National Trust took charge of Osterley in 1991. The house has enjoyed loans and gifts from Lord Jersey, including items of silver, porcelain, furniture and miniatures. The trust commissioned portraits of Lord Jersey and his wife by Howard J. Morgan, which hang upstairs. In 2014, William Villiers, 10th Earl of Jersey, the present Earl, arranged a ten-year loan to Osterley of portraits of the Child family. The pictures that are part of the loan include Allan Ramsay's portrait of Francis Child (1758), and George Romney's portrait of Francis's brother, Robert.\nThe house and small formal gardens are open to the public. They account for 30,000 paying visitors per year. Many hundreds of thousands of visitors per year walk the footpaths and enjoy the woodland of the surrounding park at no cost. A weekly 5k Parkrun takes place in the park.\nThe house saw its latest restoration from 2018 to 2021. This repaired structural deterioration and discolouring of the external brickwork.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOsterley Park information at the National Trust\nFlickr images tagged Osterley Park\nA Brief History of Osterly Park by the Dowager Countess of Jersey, 1920\nList of paintings on view"

Builders Messrs Aird and Sons for the Grand Junction Water\nWorks Company.  Rendered brick with rendered dressings.  Tower is square in plan,\ntapering in its height to the square base of the octagonal cupolas, to which the\nplan changes by means of squinches on the 4 corners.  There are 2 large cornices,\nthe lower forming the top of the plinth of the tower which is just under a third of\nits height.  The upper-cornice is immediately below the squinches to the upper\ncupola, and has modillions.  The plinth has a secondary plinth, cement rendered,\nbanding approximately one third of its height and has 3 pilasters with rendered\nimposts and 2 semi-circular arches with ventilation slits in the recessed panels.\nThis is on all 4 sides.  The shaft has a rendered plinth of banding also 3 pilasters\nand 2 rendered arches with rendered imposts. Semi-cicular above there is a circular\nwindow with a large arch springing from the 2 outside pilasters.  The cupola has\nslender openings in each face surmounted by a rendered arch on rendered imposts on\nall 8 sides.  The shaft of the cupola is topped by a very simple banded capping.\nThe cupola formerly had a copper dome.  A ball and metal rod with lighting conductor\nforms the terminal finial to the tower.  The tower contained a 4-foot rising and a\n3-foot falling pipe, and replaced an earlier standpipe which was damaged by severe\nfrost.------------------------------------                                             KEW BRIDGE ROAD, BRENTFORD\n1.\n4419\n                                             Metropolitan Water Board\n                                             Pump-house Tower Kew\n                                             Bridge\nTQ 1878 16/194I2.                                          \nBuilt 1867 as part of pump-house buildings, housing the important Boulton\nand Watt Cornish pumping machines.

    "wikipediaText": "Syon House  is the west London residence of the Duke of Northumberland.  A Grade I listed building, it lies within the 200-acre (80 hectare) Syon Park, in the London Borough of Hounslow.\nThe family's traditional central London residence had been Northumberland House in Trafalgar Square, since demolished. The eclectic interior of Syon House was designed by the architect Robert Adam in the 1760s.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSyon House derives its name from Syon Abbey, a medieval monastery of the Bridgettine Order, founded in 1415 on a nearby site by Henry V. The abbey moved to the site now occupied by Syon House in 1431. It was one of the wealthiest nunneries in the country and a local legend recites that the monks of Sheen had a ley tunnel running to the nunnery at Syon. In 1539, the abbey was closed by royal agents during the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the monastic community was expelled.\nUpon the dissolution of the abbey, Syon became the property of the Crown for a short time before long lease to the 1st Duke of Somerset, who had the site rebuilt as Syon House in the Italian Renaissance style before his death in 1552. In November 1541 and through February 1542, Henry VIII's fifth wife, Catherine Howard, was imprisoned at Syon. In February 1542, the King's men took her to the Tower of London and executed her on charges of adultery. Five years later, when King Henry VIII died, his coffin, surmounted by a jewelled effigy, rested at Syon House for one night before the procession continued to his burial place in St George's Chapel, Windsor.\nLady Jane Grey received formal notification at Syon House on Sunday, 9 July 1553 that she was King Edward VI's heir to the throne. Jane was living at her parents' house of Sheen Priory nearby, and John Dudley sent his daughter Mary, Lady Sidney, to Sheen that morning to bring Jane to Syon. A delegation consisting of Dudley and members of the Privy Council together with their wives are said by tradition to have met with Jane in what is now the Long Gallery to officially convey the news to her.\nIn 1557, it was proposed to convert the new building to the earlier Catholic use but Elizabeth I acceded to the throne before this change was effected. Syon was acquired in 1594 by Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland (1564â1632) since when it has remained in his family.\n\nIn 1609, Thomas Harriot was working at Syon when he made the first ever use of the newly invented telescope to make astronomical drawings of the moon on 26 June, several months ahead of Galileo's observations. A plaque marking Harriot can be found in the grounds, not far from where the observations took place.\nIn the late 17th century, Syon was in the possession of Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset, through his wife, Elizabeth Seymour (nÃ©e Percy). After the future Queen Anne had a disagreement with her sister, Mary II (wife of William III), over her friendship with Sarah Churchill, Countess of Marlborough, Queen Mary evicted Princess Anne from her court residence at Whitehall and Hampton Court. Princess Anne came to live at Syon with her close friends, the Somersets, in 1692. Anne gave birth to a stillborn child there. Shortly after the birth, Queen Mary came to visit her, again demanding that Anne dismiss the Countess of Marlborough and stormed out again when Anne flatly refused.\nIn the 18th century, Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland, commissioned architect and interior designer Robert Adam and landscape designer Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown to redesign the house and estate. Work began on the interior reconstruction project in 1762. Five large rooms on the west, south and east sides of the House, were completed before work ceased in 1769. A central rotunda, which Adam had intended for the interior courtyard space, was not implemented, due to cost.\nIn 1951, Syon House was opened to the public for the first time under Hugh Percy, 10th Duke of Northumberland and his wife Elizabeth.  Later, in 1995 under Ralph Percy, 12th Duke of Northumberland, the family rooms became open to the public as well.  As the Percy family continues to live there, they continue to enhance the house. Most recently the Duchess added a new central courtyard with the design of Marchioness of Salisbury.\nA Â£600K restoration was undertaken in late 2007, primarily involving work to the roof area.  In 2008 restoration work commenced on the Great Hall and a current long-term project is to restore the Adam Rooms.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nSyon House's exterior was erected in 1547 while under the ownership of the 1st Duke of Somerset.  Syon's current interior was designed by Robert Adam in 1762 under the commission of the 1st Duke and Duchess of Northumberland.\nThe well known \"Adam style\" is said to have begun with Syon House. It was commissioned to be built in the Neo-classical style, which was fulfilled, but Adam's eclectic style doesn't end there. Syon is filled with multiple styles and inspirations including a huge influence of Roman antiquity, highly visible Romantic, Picturesque, Baroque and Mannerist styles and a dash of Gothic. There is also evidence in his decorative motifs of his influence by Pompeii that he received while studying in Italy.  Adam's plan of Syon House included a complete set of rooms on the main floor, a domed rotunda with a circular inner colonnade meant for the main courtyard ('meant for' meaning that this rotunda was not built due to a lack of funds), five main rooms on the west, east and south side of the building, a pillared ante-room famous for its colour, a Great Hall, a grand staircase (though not built as grand as originally designed) and a Long Gallery stretching 136 feet long.  Adam's most famous addition is the suite of state rooms and as such they remain exactly as they were built.\nMore specific to the interior of Adam's rooms is where the elaborate detail and colour shines through.  Adam added detailed marble chimneypieces, shuttering doors and doorways in the Drawing Room, along with fluted columns with Corinthian capitals.  The long gallery, which is about 14 feet high and 14 feet wide, contains many recesses and niches into the thick wall for books along with rich and light decoration and stucco-covered walls and ceiling.  At the end of the gallery is a closet with a domed circle supported by eight columns; halfway through the columns is a doorway imitating a niche.\nIn the 1820s the north range of the house that was not completed by Adam was redesigned by Hugh Percy, 3rd Duke of Northumberland. At this time the house was also refaced in Bath stone and the porch rebuilt.  This remodelling is thought to have been done by the architect Thomas Cady, who had worked on other estates belonging to the Percy family.\nSyon House was refurbished again in the 1860s.  Algernon Percy, 4th Duke of Northumberland had Renaissance-style plaster ceilings put into the Family Drawing Room, Family Dining Room and Print Room.\nThe final plan of Syon House includes an entrance hall, ante-room, State Dining Room, State Drawing Room, Long Gallery, study, sitting room, Print Room, Family Drawing Room, Family Dining Room, private apartments on the top floor for the family to live in and a grand staircase.\n\n\n== Syon Park ==\n\nSyon Park is a 200-acre (80 hectare) park bordering the Thames, looking across the river to Kew Gardens.  Near its banks is a tidal meadow flooded twice a day by the river. It contains more than 200 species of rare trees. Although the park and lake were designed by Capability Brown in 1760, their character today is nineteenth century. The circular pool has a copy of Giambologna's Mercury.  The park and the house in the background were painted from across the Thames by J. M. W. Turner c. 1802â1810 in the painting Zion House, Isleworth and in two capriccios in 1805.\n\nThe Great Conservatory in the gardens, designed by Charles Fowler in the 1820s and completed in 1827, was the first conservatory to be built from metal and glass on a large scale. The conservatory is Grade I listed.\nHenry Percy, 11th Duke of Northumberland, who was head of the family from 1988 to 1995, was noted for planting many trees in the grounds of Syon.\nIn 2002, the English poet Geoffrey Hill released a booklength poem, The Orchards of Syon, to much acclaim. The Orchards of Syon focuses on the history of the region and in particular on the orchard of rare trees first planted in Syon Abbey.\nThe London Butterfly House was based in the grounds of Syon Park from 1981 until its closure on 28 October 2007 due to Ralph Percy, 12th Duke of Northumberland's plans to build a hotel complex on the land. In 2004, planning permission was granted for the deluxe Â£35-million Radisson Edwardian Hotel. In 2011, the Syon Park Waldorf Astoria hotel opened on the site. The hotel was renamed to the Hilton London Syon Park in 2013.\nAlso based in the grounds of Syon Park was the Heritage Motor Museum, a collection of vintage cars, which was also founded in 1981. Owing to a major increase in the number of vehicles acquired, in 1993 the museum closed and its collection was transferred to the Heritage Motor Centre at Gaydon in Warwickshire. Before that, Syon House was host to the London Transport Collection after the closure of the Clapham museum and prior to its move to Covent Garden in 1980.\nIn 2002 an annual archaeological dig was initiated, originally by the Channel 4 television Time Team programme, to excavate the remains of the lost abbey. The annual dig is now undertaken by Birkbeck College part of the University of London. It is backed up by a permanent exhibition in the undercroft.\nIn November 2010, the results from an archaeological dig made two years before on the site of the new hotel were reported, with the excavations uncovering the remains of a Roman village that existed in what was then the rural outskirts of Londinium. Artefacts uncovered included 11,500 pottery fragments, 100 coins and pieces of jewellery. Some of the finds remain unexplained, such as the discovery of skeletons \"buried in ditches placed on their side\". Although the skeletons date from the Roman period, this burial practice was said by the senior archaeologist to be \"more suggestive of unknown prehistoric rites than Roman practice\".\nSyon Park is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and Grade I listed.\n\n\n== Filming location ==\nSyon House and its grounds have frequently been used as locations for filming including: Gosford Park, King Ralph, Emma, The Avengers, Killing Eve, Belgravia and Bridgerton. \n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nAlnwick Castle, the principal seat of the Dukes of Northumberland\nHounslow parks and open spaces\nList of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Greater London\nNorthumberland House, the former central London residence of the Dukes of Northumberland, since demolished\nTreasure Houses of Britain, 1985 television documentary that shows parts of the house\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== General sources ===\nField, D.

The area fell within the parish of St Barnabas, Addison Road (built 1826-9 during the first phase of development on the estate), but by the 1860s there was a need for a second church further north. In 1868 the Revd George Booker obtained permission to build a temporary iron church on a piece of land at the western end of Addison Gardens, intended for residential development but left vacant after the failure of the builder. This church, dedicated to St John the Baptist, opened in February 1869, although a permanent lease on the site was not obtained until 1875. Meanwhile, in 1872, designs for a replacement building â a large and ambitious stone structure of cruciform plan, with a big west tower and (at least in early versions) an octagonal central lantern â were commissioned from the architect James Brooks. The foundation stone was laid in the same year, but shortage of funds and the disputed ownership of the site made for slow progress. Construction began in 1874 with the apse, built by Thomas Blake of Gravesend; the work was then taken over by the firm of Turtle and Appleton, and the eastern arm as far as the crossing was completed in 1885. (The octagonal lantern, unrealised here, reappeared in Brooksâ 1886 competition design for Liverpool Cathedral.) The nave was built by Kilby and Gayford between 1890 and 1892, by which time the west tower had also been abandoned, obliging Brooks to prepare an alternative design for the west end featuring a wheel window and triple open porches. The lower portion was not completed until 1909-11; Brooks had died in 1901, and his former assistant JS Adkins reworked his design, enclosing the outer porches and turning the central one into a baptistery. The builders for this final phase were EA Roome & Co., with carving by JE Taylerson. The total cost of the building was approximately Â£25,000. James Brooks (1825-1901) was born in Berkshire and trained under the London architect Lewis Stride, also attending classes at University College and the Royal Academy Schools before setting up in private practice in 1853. He made his reputation during the 1860s with a number of large brick churches in London's impoverished East End (e.g. St Michael, Shoreditch; St Chad and St Columba, Haggerston), whose compact plans, soaring proportions and severe Early Gothic details became Brooks's signature. Later churches, some completed by other architects, include the Ascension, Battersea (1876-98), Holy Innocents, Hammersmith (1886-1891) and All Hallows, Gospel Oak (1892â15). Brooks became vice-president of the RIBA in 1892, and was awarded the RIBA gold medal in 1895.\n\n        \n        \n            Details\n        \n        \n            Parish church, 1872-1910 by James Brooks with JS Adkins.MATERIALS: the exterior is faced in snecked Ancaster stone with Bath stone bands and dressings; the interior is entirely of Bath stone. The nave aisles are lead-roofed, all other roofs being of slate.PLAN: St Johnâs occupies a constricted mid-terrace plot, and its cruciform plan is correspondingly long and narrow. (The true alignment is SW-NE; the cardinal points given in what follows are the liturgical ones.) The church is entered from the west via a narthex comprising an octagonal baptistery-cum-porch flanked by two smaller square porches, the latter afterwards converted into chapels (St Saviourâs to the south and SS Michael and George to the north) and now used as offices. The plan of the main body of the church is characteristically Brooksian: an aisled nave of four short bays is followed by a crossing with transepts projecting only slightly beyond the aisles, and then by a two-bay chancel with a deep rounded apse; this is flanked to the south by an apsidal Lady chapel and to the north by a chapel dedicated to SS Peter and Paul. A two-storey vestry block occupies the north-east angle of the site, with the Blessed Sacrament Chapel between it and the main apse. Beneath the church is a large modern undercroft (not of special interest).*EXTERIOR: the church is viewed almost exclusively from the west, where the impressive west front, recalling a scaled-down French cathedral, appears â improbably â in the midst of a typical four-storey west London terrace. The style is Anglo-French Gothic of the early C13, with bar tracery rather than the simpler plate tracery used in Brooksâs east London churches. The dominant feature is a big wheel window in three concentric rings, the outer one formed of twelve quatrefoiled circles. Stepped arcading fills the gable above, with projecting angle-buttresses on either side rising into cylindrical pinnacles. The narthex below is in five parts, stepping up from the low twin-arched outer portals to the taller gabled porch/chapels, to the central baptistery â an almost free-standing octagon with gabled windows, pinnacles and a segmental main doorway topped with a canopied niche. The side elevations (glimpsed from between the houses on either side) are much plainer, with tall lancets in the clerestorey and heavy flying buttresses spanning the nave aisles.INTERIOR: this will be described from west to east, including fittings and glass. The BAPTISTERY contains Brooksâs massive square font (1892, originally in the north aisle), of grey Devon marble with quatrefoil relief panels depicting Baptism, Confirmation, Penance and Holy Communion, beneath a pinnacled wooden canopy crowned by a statue of St John the Baptist. (The original corner statues, representing the Four Rivers of Paradise, have been lost.) The main west portal â which Brooks intended to be open to the street, but which is now enclosed within Adkins' baptistery â has multiple orders of shafts with rich foliate capitals and equally rich mouldings in the arch above. Between the shafts are stone statues of the Wise and Foolish virgins (1909-11 by JF Taylerson). The traceried wooden screen that spans the arch has further figures, also by Taylerson: SS Gabriel and George; the Virgin and St Joseph; Synagogue and Ecclesia. The two WESTERN CHAPELS have blocked double archways that formerly opened into the aisles; the chapel of SS Michael and George, created as a WWI memorial, retains its furnishings, including a traceried wooden screen with painted figures of the two saints and a reredos with figures copied from the main rood screen (see below). A series of windows depicting Aspects of Christ runs across the two chapels and the baptistery; there is also, in St Saviourâs chapel, a stained-glass roundel of the Pelican in her Piety.The body of the church is stone-vaulted throughout â an exceptional feature that testifies to the wealth and devotion of the early congregants. Brooksâs design for the NAVE was supposedly influenced by the great Cistercian abbeys of Yorkshire, e.g. Rievaulx; the effect is one of austere strength articulated by means of vigorous linear detail. The arcades are carried on compound piers and the springing of the vault on tall clustered shafts which rest on tapering corbels. Prominent string-courses give a countervailing horizontal emphasis. The clerestorey windows are single lancets set in deep splayed recesses, while those in the aisles are double lancets with detached shafts to the central mullions. The aisle and transept windows contain stained-glass figures of saints, installed between 1894 and 1914; most are by Clayton & Bell, though one window in the south aisle is by CE Kempe. The great west window (the Virgin and Child with Patriarchs and Angels, by Percy Bacon & Bros., 1910) is set within a deep arched recess with a blind-arcaded parapet in front. Lighting is supplied by hanging globes suspended from big polychromatic angel brackets, the latter recalling those found in the roofs of East Anglian churches. The pulpit (designed by Brooks and executed in 1902 by HH Martyn of Cheltenham) is of stone with red marble shafts and inlay, and has figures in canopied niches representing St John the Baptist and the four Latin Doctors. The wooden tester (added in 1912 to Adkinsâ design) bears a figure of Our Lord. The pew-ends have turned decoration (1930s), apparently executed by members of the churchâs scout group. The aisles contain mosaic Stations of the Cross in aedicular surrounds (also by Adkins, of 1912-15).Four massive cruciform piers with engaged shafts define the CROSSING. Attached to the eastern piers are twin ambones or lecterns, similar in design to the pulpit and also made by HH Martyn; they are of stone with red and green marble shafts and inlay, and have book-rests in the form of an angel (south) and eagle (north). By the northern ambo is an immense Paschal candlestick (designed by Adkins, 1910), of golden marble with onyx banding and inlaid crosses of Egyptian porphyry, bearing figures of the Four Archangels. Behind, almost filling the chancel arch, is an immense triple-arched stone screen (1894-1900). The sculpture is by Taylerson: censing angels and foliage in the tympana, then a tier of niches with small statues of Christ and the Apostles, and crowning the whole a great Rood with angels and archangels bearing the Instruments of the Passion. The central arch contains elaborate wrought-iron gates and railings, designed by Brooks and made in 1894 by JW Singer & Son. The TRANSEPTS are distinguished by very long single wall-shafts that rise from ground level right up to the springing of the vault. Canopied statues of St John the Baptist (north) and Our Lady (south) are prominently displayed. Across the arches to the side-chapels are further stone screens, of the same date as the chancel screen and similar in design, with wrought-iron gates and railings (by Hart, Son, Peard and Co., 1903), and figures (again by Taylerson) representing missionary saints and illustrating âthe spread of the Catholic Church throughout the worldâ. The CHAPEL OF SS PETER AND PAUL, on the north side, has wall-panelling and an altar (designed by Brooks) with figures of Christ and the two saints. The altar rails (1920s) have little medievalising figures at the base. In a vaulted chamber above is the organ, originally of 1896 by August Gern, rebuilt by Henry Willis and Sons in 1928; there is no decorative organ case, only a plain pipe-rack. The LADY CHAPEL has blind wall arcading with ballflower ornament, enclosing mosaic panels and numerous memorial tablets, beneath a frieze of quatrefoils and shield-bearing angels. Its apsidal sanctuary, floored in black and white marble, is filled by an elaborate gilded stone reredos (of 1907, designed by Adkins): canopied figures of the Virgin and Child with Faith, Hope, Charity and Ecclesia (the latter holding a model of the building) alternate with reliefs of the Annunciation, Nativity, Purification and Assumption. The altar frontal (1905 by Gosse & Sons) is a painted wooden tableau illustrating the history of the Church.The CHANCEL is floored with stone slabs and encaustic tiles arranged diamond-wise, and contains stalls carved (by M Spencer, daughter of the second vicar) with foliage, scrolls and shields bearing the Instruments of the Passion. In the arches to north and south are more stone screens, again with iron railings and gates; there is a frieze of shields emblazoned with various musical instruments, and above are statues of musician angels along with saints and Old Testament figures associated with music. Beyond the arcaded altar-rails (1897), the SANCTUARY has a polychromatic marble pavement (1902), with three stone steps rising to the high altar. The latter, of 1895, displays painted panels showing the Placing in the Tomb, the Resurrection and the Harrowing of Hell. The crucifix above is of C15 Spanish make. The dominant feature, however, is the enormous arcaded stone reredos that fills most of the wall of the apse. Originally of 1892, it owes its present form to a series of enrichments and enlargements, notably of 1909 when Adkins added the lower tier of arcading with its angel spandrels and coloured marble inlays, and inserted the tall pinnacled piers that frame the projecting central section. Here the upper two tiers, along with an intervening tier of roundels, are filled with painted panels of patriarchs, prophets, saints and angels, and in the gabled central panel is represented the Adoration of the Lamb. The reredos as a whole is intended to represent the Heavenly Jerusalem as described in Revelations 7:9: âa great multitudeâ¦of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb.â Above, the central clerestorey window contains vividly-coloured glass (by Hardman) depicting Christ in Glory.The low-ceilinged VESTRY has a polychromatic tiled floor and built-in cabinets for vestments etc. Steps lead up to a tall wagon-roofed chamber above, and down to a small rib-vaulted crypt below. The little BLESSED SACRAMENT CHAPEL (added in 1912 by Adkins) was used for the Reservation of the Host for the sick and dying - a favoured practice in Anglo-Catholic churches, severely frowned upon by Low Churchmen. It has the character of a closet or hidden chamber: a narrow, confined space top-lit via a small lantern with glass representing the Four Cardinal Virtues, its walls lined with oak wainscoting tricked out with coloured prints and miniature figures of the Twelve Apostles. At the far end is a canopied reredos with painted figures of Christ and the Apostles. The Host itself was reserved in a small aumbry, whose door bears a medieval relief carving of the Risen Christ.\n* Pursuant to s.1 (5A) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (âthe Actâ) it is declared that the modern undercroft beneath the main body of the church, along with its fixtures and fittings, is not of special interest.\n\n        \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n    \n        Legacy\n    \n    \n        The contents of this record have been generated from a legacy data system.\n    \n    \n        \n            Legacy System number:\n            \n                203949\n            \n        \n        \n            Legacy System:\n            \n                LBS\n            \n        \n    \n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n                    Sources\n                \n                \n                    Books and journalsHalsey , William Richard , History of St John Baptist Church, Holland Rd, KensingtonPevsner, N, Cherry, B, The Buildings of England: London 3 North West, (1991), 458Sheppard,  FHW, Survey of London: Volume 37: Northern Kensington, (1973), 126-150WebsitesGeoffrey Tyack, âBrooks, James (1825â1901)â, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2007, accessed 4 Nov 2014 from http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/63613\n                \n\n\n\n                    \n                        \n\n\n    \n        Legal\n    \n\n\n    \n        This building is listed under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as amended for its special architectural or historic interest.\n    \n\n    \n        The listed building(s) is/are shown coloured blue on the attached map.

The Museum building was extended to the north-west in 1929-31 by the addition of the Whale Hall by JH Markham of the Office of Works and incorporates the former Geology Museum to the north-east of 1929-33, built to the designs of Sir Richard Allison and JH Markham.The North Block* (by W Kendall of the Office of Works, comprise three phases of construction of 1953-5, 1955-59, and a later phase of 1970-73) and its linking corridors* to the Waterhouse building, are excluded from the listing. The Palaeontology Wing of 1970-75* by architects of the Ministry of Public Building and Works the Department of the Environment from 1970), attached to the north-east corner of the Waterhouse building's east range and to the south-east corner of the Earth Galleries, is excluded from the listing. Attached to the west of the Waterhouse building, the Darwin Centre phase one of 1999-2002 by HOK and Darwin Centre phase two of 2006-2008 by C F Moller Architects, are less than thirty years old and have not been assessed for listing in 2016.\n    \n\n                    \n\n\n    \n        Reasons for Designation\n    \n    \n        The Natural History Museum, South Kensington, London, of 1873-81 by Alfred Waterhouse, incorporating the Whale Hall of 1929-31 by JH Markham and the Earth Galleries of 1929-33 by Sir Robert Allison and JH Markham, and the gates, gatepiers, railings and south lodge, are listed at Grade I for the following principal reasons:* Architectural interest: Waterhouseâs stately essay in early German Romanesque with extensive, intricate terracotta detailing, matched by the authoritative distinction of Allison and Markhamâs Earth Galleries and the quietly bespoke Whale Hall by Markham, share exceptional design quality, high standards of execution and thoughtful application of a range of materials and statuary to create a public building of the highest specification to house the national collection of natural history;\n* Historic interest: for the role the buildings continue to play in the rich cultural life of the country;\n* Interior: sumptuously detailed interior features and spaces, including models of animals, finely painted ceilings and a range of geometric motifs, displayed within Waterhouseâs well-lit, considered plan comprising the galleries, the Hintze Hall and connecting enfilade. The entrance hall and staircase of the Earth Galleries, and interior to the Whale Hall, are also also notable features;\n* Intactness: although there have been some minor alterations to the structure of the Museum, the historic fabric retains a high level of intactness;\n* Group value: with the Victoria and Albert Museum, also listed at Grade I, with which it has functional and historical group value, and numerous other listed buildings in close proximity.\n\n    \n\n                    \n\n\n        \n            History\n        \n        \n            The history of the Natural History Museum is well documented in Girouard (1981), Stearn (1998), the Conservation Management Plan (Alan Baxter and Associates 2003, under revision 2016) and other sources, notably the Survey of London vol.38 (1975) and the Museumâs archive. The National Archives holds a large collection of plans and correspondence relating to the development of Museum and a number of Waterhouseâs plans and sketches are held by the RIBA. A summary of the buildingâs history only is given here.The notion of housing the Natural History section of the British Museum in a new premises in South Kensington was first mooted to the Trustees of the British Museum in 1859 by (Sir) Richard Owen (1804-92), the Superintendent of the collection (and later the Museumâs first Director). Owenâs vision for top-lit, single-storeyed galleries ranged at right angles to longitudinal galleries at the front and rear, on land which formed part of the Commissionerâs Great Exhibition estate of 1851, was narrowly accepted by the Trustees in 1860. After protracted negotiations, the land was made available by the Commissioners to the Office of Works in 1864, and the competition to design the Museum was won by Captain Francis Fowke, the architect of the 1862 Great Exhibition building, on whose site the Museum was to be built, and the Scottish Museum in Edinburgh of 1861. Fowkeâs Museum in the Renaissance style was positioned on the north side of the plot, topped with a central dome, said to be inspired by St Peterâs in Rome, and flanked by cupolas with a circular staircase hall and a lecture theatre internally. Fowke died in December 1865; the 36 year-old Alfred Waterhouse (1830-1905) was appointed to execute his designs in February 1866. A political hiatus saw the plans put on hold until 1868, when Waterhouse was allowed to revise Fowkeâs elevational design rather than to implement his scheme entirely.In March 1868 Waterhouse submitted plans, sections and perspective views to the Office of Works. At the Clydesdale Bank in Lombard Street, London (1864â5) and at Strangeways Prison in Manchester, then just completing, he had used quasi-Romanesque motifs. At South Kensington he now proposed a more comprehensive essay in this style. To quote his own words he \"abandoned the idea of a Renaissance building and fell back on the earlier Romanesque style which prevailed largely in Lombardy and the Rhineland from the tenth to the end of the twelfth century\" (Stearn,1998,45). The scheme was delayed again, largely through further political and budget difficulties, during which an alternative scheme for the museum on the Embankment was seriously considered. Waterhouseâs estimated Â£495,000 cost had to be reduced to Â£330,000, and in August 1870 the amended scheme with an increased frontage, but omitting side and rear elevations, was presented. The plans were refined in 1871 and 1872, and in February 1873 the contract was let to the builders, George Baker and Son of Lambeth. Further economies were required. Between the towers, Waterhouse redesigned the centre of his faÃ§ade to rise to the present gables, and the towers themselves were to be curtailed (but later partly reinstated for fire prevention reasons). Some granite was replaced by Portland stone in the containing and approach walls, slates replaced lead on the roofs, and brick replaced terracotta in the internal courts. Inside, plaster ceilings replaced wooden, and the decoration was both reduced and postponed under Waterhouse's direction. Internal modifications included the infilling of spaces between piers, creating the blind arches between the transverse galleries still evident today. The construction is said to have been difficult, with rising costs and fixed budgets, and in particular the unreliable supply of terracotta (from Staffordshire) in such large quantities caused delays to the project and contributed to the bankruptcy of George Baker & Son in 1879 (although they were allowed to fulfil their contract).Owen continued to be a driving force behind the design. The plan of the Museum fulfilled many of his wishes, but by the time the Museum opened, some of the facilities he had wanted were absent. The key space in the building, the main hall (known as the Hintze Hall in 2016) was designed for Owen to house his Index Museum, with the side bays around it for exhibits of different groups. The smaller hall to its rear was to house the Lecture Theatre, but these spaces were not used as intended. The single storey rear galleries were alternately wide and narrow for display and study respectively, but were given over mostly to display by the time the Museum opened. Of greater success are the external and internal statuary and decorative figures instigated by Owen. Externally, carved figures of living and extinct species denoted the zoological wing at the west and the fossil wing at the east respectively. Internally, carved snakes, monkeys, insects and aquatic creatures adorn the walls and piers. The subjects were suggested by Owen in 1873, who supplied Waterhouse with figures of animals which the architect sketched for the French modeller, Dujardin, employed by the architectural modellerâs, Farmer and Brindley, to produce plaster casts for Owenâs approval before the terracotta slabs and statues were manufactured by Gibbs and Canning of Tamworth, Staffordshire.In April 1881 the Museum finally opened, two years before Owenâs retirement. It received mostly critical acclaim from the press of the period. The Times of 18 April 1881 assured Londoners \"that they will now have the opportunity of pursuing the most delightful of all studies in a true Temple of Nature, showing, as it should, the Beauty of Holiness\" (Stearn, 1998, 47). Others were not so effusive; Augustus J C Hare in 1894 referred to the building as a \"pile of mongrel Lombardic architecture,\" (Stearn,1998, 51). The Museum remains Alfred Waterhouseâs best known building, and firmly established him as one of the foremost architects of his day. A prolific architect, he has many other highly graded listed buildings to his name, including the Prudential Assurance Building, Holborn, London (NHLE 1379064, 1885-1901, Grade II*) which also features extensive use of terracotta, and Manchester Town Hall (NHLE 1207469,1868-77,Grade I). Additions to the building during the C20 include: the Whale Hall to the north-west in 1929-31; the Spirit Building of 1920-39 (which replaced an earlier Spirit Hall by Waterhouse of the 1880s) and Entomological Block of 1936-52 to the west (both demolished); the offices, lecture theatre and library block to the north in 1953-1955, 1955-59 and 1970-73; the Palaeontology Wing to the east in 1970-75. The former Geology Museum to the north-east of 1929-33, built to the designs of Sir Richard Allison and J H Markham (after Allison retired) was opened by the Duke of York (later King George VI) in July 1935. It was linked by a bridge north to the Science Museum, and incorporated into the NHM in 1986, forming the Earth Galleries. The sites of the Spirit Building and Entomological Block were redeveloped for the Darwin Centre phase one of 1999-2002 and Darwin Centre phase two of 2006-2008.ALTERATIONS: the Museum is a dynamic space which has undergone changes, generally sympathetic to the historic fabric of the buildings, and it is understood that routine maintenance of such a large estate will have resulted in like for like repairs. Nevertheless, it is acknowledged that some major alterations have occurred to the Waterhouse building, including the following. This list is not exhaustive, however:\n- Replacement fabric following bomb damage in the Second World War when on numerous occasions the galleries were hit directly; many windows were shattered, many of the roofs were destroyed, and exhibits and cases damaged (Stearn, 1998,149). The botanical gallery over the geological gallery (east front range) was reconstructed in 1962.\n-Internal modifications include openings in the side wall of the easternmost gallery to form access from the Earth Galleries, the rear wall to accommodate the North Block extension and west wall to access the Darwin Centre.\n- Openings on the east and west sides of the Hintze Hall to access east to west corridors.\n- Remodelling of the east and west access corridors at the rear of the Waterhouse building.\n- The removal of fabric in the rear galleries to allow greater exhibition space, shop units and cafe spaces.\n- The provision of lifts and stairs to the rear of the minerals gallery and in the central gallery of the east range.\n- The creation of a range of exhibitions throughout replacing earlier fittings and fixtures.\n- The provision of modern toilet facilities throughout.Modifications to the former Geology Museum (Earth Galleries) include the glass extension to the south elevation for staff stair access. Internally at the ground floor of the west end a loggia was formed at the juncture with the Waterhouse building. An escalator was installed in the main hall as part of an exhibition by Neal Potter (1996), resulting in the openings from the side galleries onto the hall being blocked. Enlargement of the entrance hall and boxing in of decorative balustrades was undertaken by Pawson Williams Architects in 1996 and the Library here was refurbished in 1987-1989. There have been minor modifications to the other later additions to the Waterhouse building which are noted in the details where relevant.The lodge to the west fronting Queen's Gate was designed by Waterhouse in c1883; it is separately listed (NHLE 1190175). The lodge at the Cromwell Road front (south) of the Museum, gates, gatepiers and railings were erected by 1881.\n\n        \n        \n            Details\n        \n        \n            Museum of 1873-81 and gates, piers and railings erected by 1881, all designed by Alfred Waterhouse and built by George Baker and Son of Lambeth. The Museum building was extended to the north-west in 1929-31 by the addition of the Whale Hall by JH Markham of the Office of Works. The former Geology Museum to the north-east of 1929-33, built to the designs of Sir Richard Allison and JH Markham, was later incorporated into the Museum forming the Earth Galleries.For the Waterhouse building, the terracotta and carved stone were manufactured by Gibbs and Canning of Tamworth, Staffordshire. The architectural modelling was by Farmer and Brindley; the plaster ceilings were painted by Best and Lea of Manchester; and the stained-glass windows designed by Waterhouse were by FT Odell of Finsbury. Burke and Company of Newman Street made the mosaic pavements and the ornamental ironwork was made by Hart, Son and Peard of Wych Street. The slating of the roofs was by T Stirling.The North Block* (by W Kendall of the Office of Works, comprises three phases of construction of 1953-5, 1955-59, and a later phase of 1970-73) and its linking corridors* to the Waterhouse building, are excluded from the listing. The Palaeontology Wing* of 1970-75 (by architects of the Ministry of Public Building and Works, the Department of the Environment from 1970), attached to the north-east corner of the Waterhouse building's east range and to the south-east corner of the Earth Galleries, is excluded from the listing. Attached to the west of the Waterhouse building, the Darwin Centre phase one of 1999-2002 by HOK and Darwin Centre phase two of 2006-2008 by C F Moller Architects, are less than thirty years old and have not been assessed for listing in 2016.MATERIALS\nThe Waterhouse building has an iron frame, bridging between masonry walls of brick and terracotta, the rear elevation of brick with terracotta dressings, and brick elevations to the galleries at the rear. Ceilings are of iron and concrete for fireproofing, with plaster finishes. Interior finishes are largely terracotta or brick in the basement, painted plaster decoration and mosaic floors to the atrium and central halls, and generally timber flooring elsewhere. The Earth Galleries (the former Geology Museum) has a steel frame, red Bracknell bricks and Portland Whitbed stone details to the facade and dressings, yellow stock bricks at the south and west elevations and slate roof coverings. Internally it has marble finishes to the entrance bay. The Whale Hall is of steel frame encased in concrete with external facings of brick with Portland stone dressings.PLAN\nOwing to the various extensions, the Museum has an evolved plan. The Waterhouse building, set back from the Cromwell Road, is symmetrical with its ground floor raised above basement workshops, storage spaces and laboratories. The central entrance has exhibition ranges to the east and west, both terminating in pavilions. To the rear of the entrance hall is the main hall (Hintze Hall) surrounded by side galleries, with a triforium above at the first floor. To the rear of the Hintze Hall is a smaller hall, originally the Gallery of British Zoology, in use as a cafeteria in 2016, the fixtures* and fittings* of which including catering equipment* are excluded from the listing. Parallel with the front ranges, and linked to them by short linking passages to each side, are ground floor axial access corridors to the west and east (termed galleries of communication by Waterhouse); these were both galleries, that to the east continues to have fossil exhibits, and that to the west was formerly the Coral Gallery. To the rear (north) of each of the corridors are six, transverse single-storey galleries, alternately wide and narrow. These have been altered in the C20 to accommodate shops* and catering facilities*, when some of the Victorian walls were removed and replaced with modern partitions*. The interior of the rear (north) access corridors* of the transverse galleries were remodelled and partially rebuilt in the late C20 and contain no historic fixtures and fittings; they are excluded from the listing.The plan of the Whale Hall, linked to the Waterhouse building at its north-west end, comprises a central hall with surrounding first floor walkways. Its east wall abuts the North Block*, excluded from the listing. East of the Waterhouse building, and linked at its north-east corner, is the former Geology Museum (Earth Galleries) with a large central hall surrounded by two reconfigured exhibition floors* and an upper gallery*, an elaborate entrance hall and stairs at the east end, and offices* on the upper floors and to the west. A modern lecture theatre and administration block* links the former Geology Museum to the near parallel Palaeontology Wing* to the south; these are both excluded from the listing.To the north of the complex is an east-west access route, known as Museum Way, and service yard*, accessed from Exhibition Road beneath the bridge to the Science Museum. The gates, gatepiers and railings are south of this route, along the Exhibition Road, Cromwell Road and Queen's Gate frontages. The small Porter's Lodge is located to the south of the Museum, adjacent to the main gate. Immediately to the south of the Waterhouse building are late-C19 railings of standard type that are not of special interest, beyond which are landscaped gardens accessed by steps that are also not of special interest.\nTHE WATERHOUSE BUILDINGEXTERIOR: a symmetrical composition, the facade is 207m long and set back from Cromwell Road. The features of the faÃ§ade are composed with single and multiple orders of round-arched window and door openings springing from columns with capitals, and robustly detailed cornices. Rich detailing in buff and blue terracotta uses a variety of motifs including geometric shapes, chevrons, rosettes, foliation and animals in relief and statuary; extinct species to the east range, and living to the west. All windows are metal-framed casements.Curved carriage ramps and flights of steps approach the central grand, cathedral-type, round-arched entrance of multiple orders resting on decorated columns with acanthus motifs to the capitals. At the centre, a pair of round-arched door openings, with square and semi-circular fanlights, is similarly embellished. Chequerboard details above are topped by a frieze of animals and foliation with five round-arched windows over. The surmounting double-height gable has pairs of round-arched windows with a front balustrade and a central round-arched panel with three windows above, flanked by two smaller pairs of windows. The gable has robust dentil decoration and was formerly topped by a figure of Adam (destroyed during the Second World War). The entrance is framed by two tall towers, 58m high, of four stages topped by spires on octagonal bases. At the lowest stage are two round-arched windows beneath square heads; at the first a single round-arched window with stylized geometric tracery; the second stage has a pair of round-arched windows with front balustrade, corresponding to those in the gable above the entrance, with an arcade of six round-arched openings above; at the third are three round-arched windows of multiple orders. Each tower has a parapet with corner pinnacles topped with spirelets. The elevations of the octagonal bases to the spires have pairs of round-arched windows, framed by piers topped by spirelets. The roofs have banded decoration and lightning conductors.The east and west ranges, each of 11 bays with rainwater goods in between, are of three storeys with a basement and terminate in ornate pavilions. The treatment to each bay is identical; the basement is lit by a pair of straight-headed windows; at the ground floor are pairs of round-arched windows with modillions beneath a squared head above; at the first floor, a single round-arched window with stylized geometric tracery and aprons decorated with mouldings of creatures, with a dentil cornice. Above, a parapet has figures of creatures on plinths between each second floor dormer; the dormers have pairs of round-arched windows beneath gablets with central roundels decorated with figures of animals. The slated, gable roof has bands of decoration and is topped with wrought iron cresting.The elevations of the east and west pavilions have the same arrangement as the ranges from basement to first floor. At the second floor is an arcade of five round-arched openings with recessed windows. Similar to the entrance towers, the corner piers are topped with spired pinnacles, set back from the parapet. The final stage of the pavilion is broadly lozenge-shaped with a hipped roof, slated with bands of decoration and topped with cresting. Single and pairs of round-arched windows are surmounted by gables central to each elevation, unified by a balustrade topped by statuary of animals. The gables to east and west have four-shaft stacks.The rear elevation of the Waterhouse building is of brick with terracotta dressings in the same arrangement as the faÃ§ade. However, the side elevations of the Hintze Hall, north hall and rear galleries were not intended to be seen and are thus relatively plain. The âpier and panelâ structure is clearly expressed; brown brick generally laid in Flemish bond contrasts with sparing buff terracotta copings and dressings to the windows. The variation in height between the wide and narrow rear galleries is evident when viewed from above, but more striking is the complex roof arrangement for lighting the spaces within. The rear is dominated by the two service towers that rise from the north-west and north-east corner piers of the rear hall. These were the smokestacks to the Waterhouse building, with back stairs wrapping around the stacks, but now serve as flues. Mostly of brown brick with buff terracotta dressings, the elevations have three tall and narrow recessed panels with arrow-slit lights, above which are three small round-arched openings with geometric tracery to the windows. Above, the terracotta-clad upper stages have three round-arched ventilation openings, with detailed cornices and parapets beneath the slated, hipped and flat-topped spires masking the boiler flues.INTERIOR: in general, interior finishes are of buff terracotta with blue terracotta details comprising plain banding, chequerboard and chevron and other geometric motifs. Most of the intricate mouldings are in buff terracotta including decorative columns, mouldings of robust dentils and chevrons to the arches and the panels with moulded animal and plant figures. All ceilings are of plastered concrete with painted mouldings and painted iron trusses. In the entrance hall and rear halls the floor coverings are combinations of polychromatic mosaics with black, white and grey geometric panels. Throughout fine timber panelled doors, many with the original furniture, and joinery remain.The basement generally has walls of exposed yellow stock brick laid in English bond. The space is divided into small offices on the south front, and clustered around light wells, with storage space behind, linked by a network of corridors, and some public realm in the form of mobility access* and picnic areas* to the south-east. The offices have plastered walls with skirtings, and in general some terracotta detailing, mosaic pavements, original windows and joinery of the period survive, but otherwise the basement is not of special interest.On the ground floor of the front (south) range there are entrance doors to the entrance hall, which is five bays wide and one bay deep; between each bay are round-headed transverse arches with moulded details. Each bay is rib vaulted, with dog tooth, chevron and geometrical mouldings and imposts decorated with foliation and creatures. The bays are supported on piers with moulded corner columns, and pilasters to the front wall. A timber Roll of Honour attached to the rear of a pier facing the hall records staff members from the British Museum and Natural History Museum on active service, an asterisk against the names of those killed in action.The main Hintze Hall, 52m long, opens to the rear of the entrance beneath an iron roof 22m high carried on perforated ribs, with clerestory glazing to the east and west and central coffered ceiling panels painted with plant specimens. These were designed by the Keeper of Botany, William Carruthers, the lower panels representing medicinal and economic plants such as olives, Scots pine, lemons and maize. Beneath the clerestory windows is a frieze of narrow arches with a wide arch in between robust brackets. The cornice above is topped with another round-arched arcade, the arches supported by a pair of muscular columns.At the north end of the hall is a monumental staircase, a broad single flight splitting to left and right at the landing and leading up to the triforium. Beneath each side flight are arched openings to the small hall at the rear. At the hallâs south end on the first floor is a bridge spanning the open space and topped by two side flights of stairs linked to a central platform, from which there are commanding vistas of the hall. A short flight southwards accesses the second floor galleries. Here, the south wall of the hall has a central round-arched recessed panel containing a statue; flanking are round-arched entrances to the rooms in the front towers. The balustrades of all stairs comprise round-arched arcades with elaborately decorated columns beneath moulded handrails and square-section moulded newels.The hall has 10 side bays to the east and west beneath a first floor triforium; the central bay on each side has been pierced to create an east-west route across the Hall. Each bay is defined by slender piers comprising three columns rising from the ground to the roof, topped with moulded capitals. The side bays have a single round-headed arch opening to the great hall, chamfered and with decorative mouldings, and shallow arched and moulded ceiling panels. There is blind arcading to the flanking bays; to the rear of each bay are shallow arches supported on two pairs of columns with square capitals decorated with shell motifs. On the first floor facing the hall, the triforium bays have three round arched openings, the central being taller, supported on four columns with those to the side engaged with the piers. The balustrades, like those to the stairs, are arcaded with moulded columns. The ceilings comprise two shallow arched panels, with painted coffered mouldings. The three stained glass windows to the external elevation of each bay are simple square, leaded light casements with small roundels.The north wall of the hall above the landing is broadly divided into three round-arched panels defined by two piers. The central section is the widest and contains three round arched windows with moulded mullions and stained glass with geometric and floral motifs; to each side the panels have a pair of windows with mullions and a roundel above. The windows rest on a frieze of small-arched arcades above round arched stained glass windows, two in the outer panels and four to the centre, with polychromatic leaded lights. Commemorative plaques are inserted into this north wall.North of the Hintze Hall is a smaller hall, a cafeteria space in 2016, the fixtures* and fittings* of which are excluded from the listing, beneath a similar roof to the main hall but lit from clerestories to the north and south, rather than the east and west. At the ground floor are two single round-arched openings to the east and west, and three to the north and south. Above there is a triforium with pairs of in line columns with polychromatic stained glass windows to the exterior wall beyond. The corridor access* to the North Block* is through the central arch of the north wall; the flanking arches have been blocked in.The double entrances to the long east and west galleries are from the entrance hall through vaulted bays adjacent to the atrium on the ground floor; the gallery spaces extend into the ground and first floors of the pavilions at each end, but there were partitions between the two spaces originally. These were partly inspected. In February, 2016, neither of the west galleries is open to the public, the lower being refitted for a new Dinosaur exhibition, the upper is the vacant former Darwin Gallery with inserted mezzanine* and wall panels masking the original finishes. The ground floor former Geology Gallery to the east has been converted into a shop* and the Ecology exhibition*. The lifts* and stairs* to the rear of the east galleries are excluded from the listing. At the first floor, the galleries are approached through double round-arches with roundel decoration in the tympanum. Despite their current uses, these galleries share a similar treatment on both the ground and first floors. Iron âHâ section piers are clad in buff terracotta, the lower panels featuring creatures, seascapes and foliation with moulded capitals featuring projecting animal heads, foliation and scrolls above. The pilasters to the side walls are similarly treated. The shallow arched concrete and iron ceilings are plastered with painted moulded decoration. The second floor gallery to the east was rebuilt following damage in the Second World War, and as modern fabric has less architectural interest. That to the west is in use as the herbarium, and there is no public access; it was not inspected but is understood to have an arched ceiling with moulded plaster decoration and top lighting.Linking the east and west galleries to the rear access corridors are short corridors with round-arched openings decorated with chevrons but without capitals; those from the west gallery form enfilades in a particularly well-composed arrangement. Although both east and west corridors have the same function, they take different forms. The east access corridor is entered from the centre of the Hintze Hall through a loggia with a mosaic floor and a dentil cornice (formerly part of the hall). A pair of shallow-arched doorways with timber panelled doors, with three blind shallow arches resting on pairs of columns above, leads into the top-lit, gabled corridor with a dentil cornice, used as the Fossil Gallery from 1881. From here the alternately wide and narrow single storey galleries are aligned north-south; the entrances to the wide galleries are shallow-arched, and round-arched to the narrow, both moulded and with timber panelled doors. Each gallery has a mansard roof, which is supported on ribs with painted ceiling panels and clerestories in the wide galleries and on terracotta-clad arches with top-lighting in the narrow galleries. At the north end are up to nine stained glass windows arranged in a semi-circular panel or lunette; round-headed arches, often blind or blocked are in the side walls. Some of the original dividing walls between the galleries have been removed and replaced with modern structures*; these are excluded from the listing. The restaurant*, staff canteen* above (and all catering equipment*), modern access stairs* and lift* constructed at the centre of the east set of transverse galleries, and the shop fixtures* and fittings* adjacent are excluded from the listing.The west access corridor (formally the Coral Gallery) is lower, arranged in three-bay sections; the central section is defined by two upper partitions each with three stained glass windows and lit by a top lantern. The outer sections have top-lit gables. The cornice to the north and south wall comprises a double row of dog tooth mouldings. Entrance to the wide galleries is through three shallow-arched openings, each with two orders of mouldings above, and a single round-arched opening to the narrow gallery. The interiors of the galleries are believed to be similar to those off the east corridor but were not inspected. The shop and its fixtures* and fittings* located at the centre of the west set of transverse galleries is excluded from the listing.The upper levels of the east and west pavilions are used for offices, storage and plant*. The rooms within the two flanking entrance towers are no longer in use; they contain some late C19 fixtures and fittings of standard type. The towers to the rear are part of the heating system and contain flues* and other modern equipment*.SERVICES: the Waterhouse building had a fresh-air ventilation system and a hot-air system fired by coal-fired boilers. Some of the ventilators are said to survive in the south galleries and high level extracts are set behind architectural features.\nTHE WHALE HALLEXTERIOR: mostly obscured, but with a mansard roof with slate covering above the clerestories. INTERIOR: partly inspected in January 2016 owing to refurbishment works, the large central hall is lit by clerestory windows with geometric leaded lights to the north and south with a plain flat ceiling between. The hall is surrounded by walkways to the ground and first floors, the openings with metal balustrades with Moderne styling between the concrete piers providing observation points. To the east and west ends are slightly projecting platforms with plain metal balustrades beneath timber handrails. There are black marble skirtings and the floor, obscured at the time of the inspection, has an early type of linoleum covering.\nTHE EARTH GALLERIES (FORMER GEOLOGY MUSEUM)EXTERIOR: exceptional interest is found at the classical, symmetric faÃ§ade in stone at the east, facing Exhibition Road, and the north return as far as the bridge north to the Science Museum. The facade is of four storeys. At the centre, the entrance has a muscular carved stone surround topped by a plaque stating âGeological/ Survey & Museumâ. The entrance is dwarfed by the projecting, double-height classical portico to its rear with four columns of the Corinthian order in antis. Above, the pediment has guttae and dentil details, and at the centre a carved roundel. At the rear of the portico are three rectangular windows with moulded stone surrounds and geometric stained glass; part of the windows which light the floors above and below are visible. To either side are squareâheaded windows to each floor level, lighting the staircase within, all with moulded surrounds. Above the projecting cornice has dentils. The lower pitch of the mansard roof is clad with stone, through which are punctuated square windows with carved and detailed surrounds; the upper pitch is slated. To the left (south) of the facade is the link* to the Palaeontology Wing*, excluded from the listing. The right (north) return has a similar treatment as the faÃ§ade; set back is the two storey âbridgeâ to the Science Museum, clad in stone with rusticated treatment at the ground floor and ashlar above. At the centre is a round-arched entrance with a wrought iron gate, with a window with carved classical surround above. The south and west elevations of yellow stock brick are of pier and panel form with concrete and stone banding and recessed metal-framed casement windows with concrete lintels and cills. The rear elevation of the bridge is in red brick.Over the central hall, is a glazed barrel vault framed by a slated mansard roof with side lights. Rising to the rear (west) of the vaulted roof is plant housing, further to the west of which is a glazed addition to the flat roof over seven floors of offices. The south, west and north (west of the bridge to the Science Museum) elevations are utilitarian in construction and are not of special interest.INTERIOR: the focus of exceptional interest is the entrance hall and staircase which rises through four storeys, featuring British and Irish marble floor coverings, finishes and decoration; the marbles are mainly from Devon, Derbyshire, Purbeck and Connemara. The loggia at the ground floor has an arched opening beneath a bridge-like structure which leads up to the hall and onto the staircase. This bridge has banded green and buff marble with black marble to the opening; flights of stairs to each side terminate in a central platform from which the hall is viewed. The balustrade here has very ornate ironwork. From the platform a flight of steps leads to a landing behind the portico from where double stairs rise, with solid balustrades and square section newels all clad with granite and stone. The main hall has a modern escalator* rising to the remodelled upper galleries*, all of which have recent fixtures* and fittings*. Flanking the escalator at the ground floor are a cafeteria*, the fixtures*, fittings* and equipment* of which are excluded from the listing, and a shop space, the fixtures* and fittings* of which are also excluded from the listing. At the north-west corner is the library. The ground floor loggia between the Earth Galleries and Waterhouse building is remodelled and is not of special interest. The interior space* of the bridge to the Science Museum has modern fixtures* and fittings* and is excluded from the listing.SUBSIDIARY FEATURES \nBroad steps lead up to the Museumâs main entrance set back from Cromwell Road. The former Porter's Lodge to the front of the Museum, near to its Cromwell Road entrance, is the survivor of a pair (the other, a Policeman's Lodge, was destroyed in the Second World War). It is single storey, clad in buff terracotta with a hipped, slated roof topped with leaded finials. An external chimney on its north elevation has a decorated stack, beneath which is a roundel with a lionâs head in relief. There is a small round-arched opening on its west elevation, and a door at the south. The interior was not inspected.The gates, gatepiers and railings to the Museum extend along the Cromwell Road to the south, Queenâs Gate to the west and Exhibition Road to the east. They were designed by Alfred Waterhouse and comprise Portland stone piers of square or octagonal section, which support wrought iron railings. The Cromwell Road entrances have larger square piers topped by lanterns, with inset terracotta reliefs of plants or animals and elaborate wrought iron gates.

    "wikipediaText": "The Natural History Museum in London is a museum that exhibits a vast range of specimens from various segments of natural history. It is one of three major museums on Exhibition Road in South Kensington, the others being the Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum. The Natural History Museum's main frontage, however, is on Cromwell Road.\nThe museum is home to life and earth science specimens comprising some 80 million items within five main collections: botany, entomology, mineralogy, palaeontology and zoology. The museum is a centre of research specialising in taxonomy, identification and conservation. Given the age of the institution, many of the collections have great historical as well as scientific value, such as specimens collected by Charles Darwin. The museum is particularly famous for its exhibition of dinosaur skeletons and ornate architectureâsometimes dubbed a cathedral of natureâboth exemplified by the large Diplodocus cast that dominated the vaulted central hall before it was replaced in 2017 with the skeleton of a blue whale hanging from the ceiling. The Natural History Museum Library contains an extensive  collection of books, journals, manuscripts, and artwork linked to the work and research of the scientific departments; access to the library is by appointment only. The museum is recognised as the pre-eminent centre of natural history and research of related fields in the world.\nAlthough commonly referred to as the Natural History Museum, it was officially known as British Museum (Natural History) until 1992, despite legal separation from the British Museum itself in 1963. Originating from collections within the British Museum, the landmark Alfred Waterhouse building was built and opened by 1881 and later incorporated the Geological Museum. The Darwin Centre is a more recent addition, partly designed as a modern facility for storing the valuable collections.\nLike other publicly funded national museums in the United Kingdom, the Natural History Museum does not charge an admission fee.\nThe museum is an exempt charity and a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. The Princess of Wales is a patron of the museum. There are approximately 850 staff at the museum. The two largest strategic groups are the Public Engagement Group and Science Group.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe foundation of the collection was that of the Ulster doctor Sir Hans Sloane (1660â1753), who allowed his significant collections to be purchased by the British Government at a price well below their market value at the time. This purchase was funded by a lottery. Sloane's collection, which included dried plants, and animal and human skeletons, was initially housed in Montagu House, Bloomsbury, in 1756, which was the home of the British Museum.\nMost of the Sloane collection had disappeared by the early decades of the nineteenth century. Dr George Shaw (Keeper of Natural History 1806â1813) sold many specimens to the Royal College of Surgeons and had periodic cremations of material in the grounds of the museum. His successors also applied to the trustees for permission to destroy decayed specimens. In 1833, the Annual Report states that, of the 5,500 insects listed in the Sloane catalogue, none remained. The inability of the natural history departments to conserve its specimens became notorious: the Treasury refused to entrust it with specimens collected at the government's expense. Appointments of staff were bedevilled by gentlemanly favouritism; in 1862 a nephew of the mistress of a Trustee was appointed Entomological Assistant despite not knowing the difference between a butterfly and a moth.\nJ. E. Gray (Keeper of Zoology 1840â1874) complained of the incidence of mental illness amongst staff: George Shaw threatened to put his foot on any shell not in the 12th edition of Linnaeus' Systema Naturae; another had removed all the labels and registration numbers from entomological cases arranged by a rival. The huge collection of the conchologist Hugh Cuming was acquired by the museum, and Gray's own wife had carried the open trays across the courtyard in a gale: all the labels blew away. That collection is said never to have recovered.\nThe Principal Librarian at the time was Antonio Panizzi; his contempt for the natural history departments and for science in general was total. The general public was not encouraged to visit the museum's natural history exhibits. In 1835 to a Select Committee of Parliament, Sir Henry Ellis said this policy was fully approved by the Principal Librarian and his senior colleagues.\nMany of these faults were corrected by the palaeontologist Richard Owen, appointed Superintendent of the natural history departments of the British Museum in 1856. His changes led Bill Bryson to write that \"by making the Natural History Museum an institution for everyone, Owen transformed our expectations of what museums are for\".\n\n\n=== Planning and architecture of new building ===\nOwen saw that the natural history departments needed more space, and that implied a separate building as the British Museum site was limited. Land in South Kensington was purchased, and in 1864 a competition was held to design the new museum. Only thirty-three submissions were made, many of which contained elements of the Renaissance style. The winning entry was submitted by the civil engineer Captain Francis Fowke, who died shortly afterwards in December of 1865. To give the project to the second place winner would have been viewed as disrespectful to Fowke's memory, and instead the decision was made to expand on his original plans. The scheme was taken over by Alfred Waterhouse, who was hired in February of 1866, and who substantially revised the agreed plans, and designed the faÃ§ades in his own idiosyncratic Romanesque style, which was inspired by his frequent visits to the Continent. The original plans included wings on either side of the main building, but these plans were soon abandoned for budgetary reasons. Initially, Waterhouse's approximate cost was Â£495,000, but after further discussion was revised to Â£330,000. The space these would have occupied are now taken by the Earth Galleries and Darwin Centre. Waterhouse spent time with those in charge of each department of the museum to learn more about their needs, which helped him clarify his plans before construction began.\n\nWork began in 1873 and was completed in 1880. The new museum opened on 18 April 1881, although the move from the old museum was not fully completed until 1883. The museum received both positive and negative reviews by the media upon it's opening, but most viewed the museum as a positive contribution to society. In addition to routine maintenance, the building has been altered over the years, especially after it sustained damage in World War II.\nBoth the interiors and exteriors of the Waterhouse building make extensive use of architectural terracotta tiles to resist the sooty atmosphere of Victorian London, manufactured by the Tamworth-based company of Gibbs and Canning. The tiles and bricks feature many relief sculptures of flora and fauna, with living and extinct species featured within the west and east wings respectively. This explicit separation was at the request of Owen, and has been seen as a statement of his contemporary rebuttal of Darwin's attempt to link present species with past through the theory of natural selection. Though Waterhouse slipped in a few anomalies, such as bats amongst the extinct animals and a fossil ammonite with the living species. The sculptures were produced from clay models by a French sculptor based in London, M Dujardin, working to drawings prepared by the architect.\nThe central axis of the museum is aligned with the tower of Imperial College London (formerly the Imperial Institute) and the Royal Albert Hall and Albert Memorial further north. These all form part of the complex known colloquially as Albertopolis.\n\n\n=== Separation from the British Museum ===\n\nEven after the opening, the Natural History Museum legally remained a department of the British Museum with the formal name British Museum (Natural History), usually abbreviated in the scientific literature as B.M.(N.H.). A petition to the Chancellor of the Exchequer was made in 1866, signed by the heads of the Royal, Linnean and Zoological societies as well as naturalists including Darwin, Wallace and Huxley, asking that the museum gain independence from the board of the British Museum, and heated discussions on the matter continued for nearly one hundred years. Finally, with the passing of the British Museum Act 1963, the British Museum (Natural History) became an independent museum with its own board of trustees, although â despite a proposed amendment to the act in the House of Lords â the former name was retained. In 1989 the museum publicly re-branded itself as the Natural History Museum and stopped using the title British Museum (Natural History) on its advertising and its books for general readers. Only with the Museums and Galleries Act 1992 did the museum's formal title finally change to the Natural History Museum.\n\n\n=== Geological Museum ===\n\nIn 1985, the museum merged with the adjacent Geological Museum of the British Geological Survey, which had long competed for the limited space available in the area. The Geological Museum became world-famous for exhibitions including an active volcano model and an earthquake machine (designed by James Gardner), and housed the world's first computer-enhanced exhibition (Treasures of the Earth). The museum's galleries were completely rebuilt and relaunched in 1996 as The Earth Galleries, with the other exhibitions in the Waterhouse building retitled The Life Galleries. The Natural History Museum's own mineralogy displays remain largely unchanged as an example of the 19th-century display techniques of the Waterhouse building.\nThe central atrium design by Neal Potter overcame visitors' reluctance to visit the upper galleries by \"pulling\" them through a model of the Earth made up of random plates on an escalator. The new design covered the walls in recycled slate and sandblasted the major stars and planets onto the wall. The museum's 'star' geological exhibits are displayed within the walls. Six iconic figures were the backdrop to discussing how previous generations have viewed Earth. These were later removed to make place for a Stegosaurus skeleton that was put on display in late 2015.\n\n\n=== The Darwin Centre ===\nThe Darwin Centre (named after Charles Darwin) was designed as a new home for the museum's collection of tens of millions of preserved specimens, as well as new work spaces for the museum's scientific staff and new educational visitor experiences. Built in two distinct phases, with two new buildings adjacent to the main Waterhouse building, it is the most significant new development project in the museum's history.\nPhase one of the Darwin Centre opened to the public in 2002, and it houses the zoological department's 'spirit collections'âorganisms preserved in alcohol. Phase Two was unveiled in September 2008 and opened to the general public in September 2009. It was designed by the Danish architecture practice C. F. MÃ¸ller Architects in the shape of a giant, eight-story cocoon and houses the entomology and botanical collectionsâthe 'dry collections'. It is possible for members of the public to visit and view non-exhibited items for a fee by booking onto one of the several Spirit Collection Tours offered daily.\nArguably the most famous creature in the centre is the 8.62-metre-long giant squid, affectionately named Archie.\n\n\n=== The Attenborough Studio ===\nAs part of the museum's remit to communicate science education and conservation work, a new multimedia studio forms an important part of Darwin Centre Phase 2. In collaboration with the BBC's Natural History Unit (holder of the largest archive of natural history footage) the Attenborough Studioânamed after the broadcaster Sir David Attenboroughâprovides a multimedia environment for educational events. The studio holds regular lectures and demonstrations, including free Nature Live talks on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.\n\n\n== Major specimens and exhibits ==\n\nOne of the most famous and certainly most prominent of the exhibitsânicknamed \"Dippy\"âis a 105-foot (32 m)-long replica of a Diplodocus carnegii skeleton which was on display for many years within the central hall. The cast was given as a gift by the Scottish-American industrialist Andrew Carnegie, after a discussion with King Edward VII, then a keen trustee of the British Museum. Carnegie paid Â£2,000 (equivalent to Â£272,185 in 2023) for the casting, copying the original held at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. The pieces were sent to London in 36 crates, and on 12 May 1905, the exhibit was unveiled to great public and media interest. The real fossil had yet to be mounted, as the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh was still being constructed to house it. As word of Dippy spread, Mr Carnegie paid to have additional copies made for display in most major European capitals and in Central and South America, making Dippy the most-viewed dinosaur skeleton in the world. The dinosaur quickly became an iconic representation of the museum, and has featured in many cartoons and other media, including the 1975 Disney comedy One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing.  After 112 years on display at the museum, the dinosaur replica was removed in early 2017 to be replaced by the actual skeleton of a young blue whale, a 128-year-old skeleton nicknamed \"Hope\". Dippy went on a tour of various British museums starting in 2018 and concluding in 2020 at Norwich Cathedral.\n\nThe blue whale skeleton, Hope, that has replaced Dippy, is another prominent display in the museum. The display of the skeleton, some 82 feet (25 m) long and weighing 4.5 tonnes, was only made possible in 1934 with the building of the New Whale Hall (now the Mammals (blue whale model) gallery). The whale had been in storage for 42 years since its stranding on sandbanks at the mouth of Wexford Harbour, Ireland in March 1891 after being injured by whalers. At this time, it was first displayed in the Mammals (blue whale model) gallery, but now takes pride of place in the museum's Hintze Hall. Discussion of the idea of a life-sized model also began around 1934, and work was undertaken within the Whale Hall itself. Since taking a cast of such a large animal was deemed prohibitively expensive, scale models were used to meticulously piece the structure together. During construction, workmen left a trapdoor within the whale's stomach, which they would use for surreptitious cigarette breaks. Before the door was closed and sealed forever, some coins and a telephone directory were placed insideâthis soon growing to an urban myth that a time capsule was left inside. The work was completedâentirely within the hall and in view of the publicâin 1938. At the time it was the largest such model in the world, at 92 feet (28 m) in length. The construction details were later borrowed by several American museums, who scaled the plans further. The work involved in removing Dippy and replacing it with Hope was documented in a BBC Television special, Horizon: Dippy and the Whale, narrated by David Attenborough, which was first broadcast on BBC Two on 13 July 2017, the day before Hope was unveiled for public display.\nThe Darwin Centre is host to Archie, an 8.62-metre-long giant squid taken alive in a fishing net near the Falkland Islands in 2004. The squid is not on general display, but stored in the large tank room in the basement of the Phase 1 building. It is possible for members of the public to visit and view non-exhibited items behind the scenes for a fee by booking onto one of the several Spirit Collection Tours offered daily. On arrival at the museum, the specimen was immediately frozen while preparations commenced for its permanent storage. Since few complete and reasonably fresh examples of the species exist, \"wet storage\" was chosen, leaving the squid undissected. A 9.45-metre acrylic tank was constructed (by the same team that provide tanks to Damien Hirst), and the body preserved using a mixture of formalin and saline solution.\nThe museum holds the remains and bones of the \"River Thames whale\", a northern bottlenose whale that lost its way on 20 January 2006 and swam into the Thames. Although primarily used for research purposes, and held at the museum's storage site at Wandsworth.\nDinocochlea, one of the longer-standing mysteries of paleontology (originally thought to be a giant gastropod shell, then a coprolite, and now a concretion of a worm's tunnel), has been part of the collection since its discovery in 1921.\nThe museum keeps a wildlife garden on its west lawn, on which a potentially new species of insect resembling Arocatus roeselii was discovered in 2007.\n\n\n== Galleries ==\n\nThe museum is divided into four sets of galleries, or zones, each colour coded to follow a broad theme.\n\n\n=== Red Zone ===\n\nThis is the zone that can be entered from Exhibition Road, on the East side of the building. It is a gallery themed around the changing history of the Earth.\nEarth's Treasury shows specimens of rocks, minerals and gemstones behind glass in a dimly lit gallery. Lasting Impressions is a small gallery containing specimens of rocks, plants and minerals, of which most can be touched.\n\nEarth Hall (Stegosaurus skeleton)\nHuman Evolution\nEarth's Treasury\nLasting Impressions\nRestless Surface\nFrom the Beginning\nVolcanoes and Earthquakes\nThe Waterhouse Gallery (temporary exhibition space)\n\n\n=== Green zone ===\n\nThis zone is accessed from the Cromwell Road entrance via the Hintze Hall and follows the theme of the evolution of the planet.\n\nBirds\nCreepy Crawlies\nFossil Way (marine reptiles, a giant sloth, and the Swindon stegosaur Dacentrurus)\nHintze Hall (formerly the Central Hall, with blue whale skeleton and giant sequoia)\nMinerals\nThe Vault\nFossils from the UK\nAnning Rooms (exclusive space for members and patrons of the museum)\nInvestigate\nEast Pavilion (space for changing Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition)\n\n\n=== Blue zone ===\n\nTo the left of the Hintze Hall, this zone explores the diversity of life on the planet.\n\nDinosaurs\nFish, Amphibians and Reptiles\nHuman Biology\nImages of Nature\nThe Jerwood Gallery (temporary exhibition space)\nMarine Invertebrates\nMammals\nMammals Hall (blue whale model)\nTreasures in the Cadogan Gallery\n\n\n=== Orange zone ===\n\nEnables the public to see science at work and also provides spaces for relaxation and contemplation.

These include for example a highly praised \"How Science Works\" hands on workshop for school students demonstrating the use of microfossils in geological research. The museum also played a major role in securing designation of the Jurassic Coast of Devon and Dorset as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and has subsequently been a lead partner in the Lyme Regis Fossil Festivals.\nIn 2005, the museum launched a project to develop notable gallery characters to patrol display cases, including 'facsimiles' of Carl Linnaeus, Mary Anning, Dorothea Bate and William Smith. They tell stories and anecdotes of their lives and discoveries and aim to surprise visitors.\nIn 2010, a six-part BBC documentary series was filmed at the museum entitled Museum of Life exploring the history and behind the scenes aspects of the museum.\nSince May 2001, the Natural History Museum admission has been free for some events and permanent exhibitions. However, there are certain temporary exhibits and shows that require a fee.\nThe Natural History museum combines the museum's life and earth science collections with specialist expertise in \"taxonomy, systematics, biodiversity, natural resources, planetary science, evolution and informatics\" to tackle scientific questions.\nIn 2011, the museum led the setting up of an International Union for Conservation of Nature Bumblebee Specialist Group, chaired by Dr. Paul H. Williams, to assess the threat status of bumblebee species worldwide using Red List criteria.\n\n\n== Access ==\n\nThe closest London Underground station is South Kensington â there is a tunnel from the station that emerges close to the entrances of all three museums. Admission to the museum is free, though there are donation boxes in the foyer.\nMuseum Lane immediately to the north provides disabled access to the museum.\nA connecting bridge between the Natural History and Science museums closed to the public in the late 1990s.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe museum plays an important role in the 1975 London-based Disney live-action feature One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing; the eponymous skeleton is stolen from the museum, and a group of intrepid nannies hide inside the mouth of the museum's blue whale model (in fact a specially created prop â the nannies peer out from behind the whale's teeth, but a blue whale is a baleen whale and has no teeth). Additionally, the film is set in the 1920s, before the blue whale model was built.\nThe museum features as a base for Prodigium, a secret society which studies and fights monsters, first appearing on The Mummy.\nIn the 2014 film Paddington, Millicent Clyde is a devious and treacherous taxidermist at the museum. She kidnaps Paddington, intending to kill and stuff him, but is thwarted by the Brown family after scenes involving chases inside and on the roof of the building.\nThe museum was prominently featured in the Sky One 2014 documentary David Attenborough's Natural History Museum Alive where several extinct creatures exhibited at the museum including Dippy the Diplodocus were brought to life using CGI.\nThe museum features prominently in the level Lud's Gate from Tomb Raider III, with Core Design launching the game with Jonathan Ross at the museum on 15 October 1998.\nAndy Day's CBeebies shows, Andy's Dinosaur Adventures and Andy's Prehistoric Adventures are filmed in the Natural History Museum.\nThe museum was site of the first Pit Stop on The Amazing Race 33.\nThe Museum is featured in the fifth episode of the Apple TV+ period drama The Essex Serpent.\n\n\n== Natural History Museum at Tring ==\n\nThe NHM also has an outpost in Tring, Hertfordshire, built by local eccentric Lionel Walter Rothschild. The NHM took ownership in 1938. In 2007, the museum announced that the name would be changed to the Natural History Museum at Tring, though the older name, the Walter Rothschild Zoological Museum, is still in widespread use.\n\n\n== Move of collections to Harwell and Shinfield ==\nThere has been some discussion of plans to move major parts of the collections to sites in Harwell (which was abandoned) and then to Shinfield, Berkshire. These plans have been heavily criticized, together with the overall departure of the strategic direction of the museum.\n\n\n== See also ==\nJames John Joicey\nKeeper of Entomology, Natural History Museum\nSophie the Stegosaurus\nCategory:Employees of the Natural History Museum, London\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDr Martin Lister: A bibliography by Geoffrey Keynes.

    "wikipediaText": "Debenham House (or Peacock House) at 8 Addison Road is a large detached house in the Holland Park district of Kensington and Chelsea, W14. Built in the Arts and Crafts style by the architect Halsey Ricardo, it is a Grade I listed building.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe house was designed in 1905 for department store owner Ernest Ridley Debenham. Debenham had previously lived in another house designed by Ricardo, at 57 Melbury Road in Holland Park. The house only became known as Debenham House after it was sold on Sir Ernest's death.\nFrom 1955 to 1965 the house was used by the London College of Dance and Drama. In the 1990s it housed the headquarters of Richmond Fellowship and was the venue for Royal Garden Parties.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nDebenham House combines an Italianate exterior with an Arts and Crafts interior. Both are richly decorated. The house is clad in Royal Doulton Carrara ware with green and blue Burmantofts bricks. Ricardo favoured polychromy for its design effects, but it also served a practical purpose, as the glazing resisted the aging effects of the polluted London air. The critic Jonathan Meades described the house as \"structurally stodgy â an alderman dressed as a hippy.\"\nThe interior contains tiles designed by William De Morgan, a mosaic dome painted by Gaetano Meo, ceilings painted by Ernest Gimson and stained glass by Edward Schroeder Prior. The decoration throughout is overwhelming. A domed hall has a gallery linking the upstairs rooms. Mosaics show members of the Debenham family, mixed with gods and goddesses from classical mythology. There are marble and tile fireplaces and mahogany bookcases with decorated with Art Nouveau inserts in wood and mother of pearl. The light switches were made by the Birmingham Guild of Handicraft.\n\n\n== Filming location ==\nThe house has been used as a film location, including; The Wings of the Dove (1997 film), Secret Ceremony, What the Butler Saw, Spooks, two episodes of Agatha Christie's Poirot, Lord Edgware Dies and Cards on the Table, Trottie True and the BBC's Mrs. Bradley Murder Mysteries.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nStourton, James (2012).

    "wikipediaText": "The Royal Tennis Court, Hampton Court Palace is a Grade I listed court for playing the sport of real tennis.  It was built for Cardinal Wolsey between 1526 and 1529. Henry VIII of England played there from 1528.  This court is still home to an active tennis club.  In 2015 it was closed to visitors for major restoration works.\nDuring the 17th century various improvements were made to the court. One of the first acts of Charles II after his restoration in 1660 was to order the extensive refitting of the Tudor tennis court. This included the laying of a new tile floor, the remodelling of the galleries and repairs to the roof. At the same time, new nets, curtains and velvet cushions for the spectators' seats were provided. The interlaced initials above the net on the wall opposite the corridors are, however, not those of Charles but of William III and Mary II (1689â1702). Since the end of the 17th century the court has undergone little alteration. However, progress is not incompatible with history: in 1975 sodium halide lighting was installed.\n\n\n== Real Tennis World Championship matches ==\nThe Real Tennis World Championship has been played at the Royal Tennis Court on five occasions:\n\n1885 Thomas Pettitt beat George Lambert 7â5\n1977 Howard Angus beat Gene Scott 7â2\n1979 Howard Angus beat Chris Ronaldson 7â0\n1983 Chris Ronaldson beat Wayne Davies 7â4\n2002 Rob Fahey beat Tim Chisholm 7â6\nThe Ladies' World Championship, inaugurated in 1985, was played at the Royal Tennis Court in 1999, when defending champion Penny Lumley beat Sue Haswell 2â1 in the final.\n\n\n== The court today ==\nThe court is home to a real tennis club of over 450 members. The club is active in interclub competitions and fields sides in the National League (administered by the International Real Tennis Professionals Association) and also in Tennis and Rackets Association tournaments including the Field Trophy. The court hosts the annual Champions Trophy, part of the qualifying series for the Real Tennis World Championship.\nThe club regularly records the highest court usage of any court in the world, along with the courts at Radley College, Oxfordshire and the Royal Melbourne Tennis Club.\n\n\n== Masters of the Royal Tennis Courts ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nReal tennis organizations\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Royal Tennis Court at Hampton Court Palace"

    "wikipediaText": "Ham House is a 17th-century house set in formal gardens on the bank of the River Thames in Ham, south of Richmond in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. The original house was completed in 1610 by Thomas Vavasour, an Elizabethan courtier and Knight Marshal to James I. It was then leased, and later bought, by William Murray, a close friend and supporter of Charles I. The English Civil War saw the house and much of the estate sequestrated, but Murray's wife Catherine regained them on payment of a fine. During the Protectorate his daughter Elizabeth Murray, Countess of Dysart on her father's death in 1655, successfully navigated the prevailing anti-royalist sentiment and retained control of the estate.\nThe house achieved its greatest period of prominence following Elizabeth's second marriageâto John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale, in 1672. The Lauderdales held important roles at the court of the restored Charles II, the Duke being a member of the Cabal ministry and holder of major positions in Scotland, while the Duchess exercised significant social and political influence. They began an ambitious program of development and embellishment at Ham. The house was almost doubled in size and equipped with private apartments for the Duke and Duchess, as well as princely accommodation suites for visitors. The house was furnished to the highest standards of courtly taste and decorated with \"a lavishness which transcended even what was fitting to their exalted rank\". The Lauderdales accumulated notable collections of paintings, tapestries and furniture, and redesigned the gardens and grounds to reflect their status and that of their guests.\nAfter the Duchess's death, the property passed through the line of her descendants. Occasionally, major alterations were made to the house, such as the reconstruction undertaken by Lionel Tollemache, 4th Earl of Dysart, in the 1730s. For the most part, later generations of owners focused on the preservation of the house and its collections. The family did not retain the high position at court held by the Lauderdales under Charles II, and a strain of family eccentricity and reserve saw the fifth Earl refuse a request from King George III to visit Ham. On the death of the 9th Earl â the last Earl to live at Ham â in 1935, the house passed to his second cousin, Lyonel; he and his son, Major (Cecil) Lyonel Tollemache, donated it to the National Trust in 1948. During the second half of the 20th century the house and gardens were opened to the public, and were extensively restored and researched. The property has become a popular filming location for cinema and television productions, which make use of its period interiors and gardens.\nThe house is built of red brick, and was originally constructed to a traditional Elizabethan era H-plan; the southern, garden frontage was infilled during the Lauderdales' rebuilding. The architect of Vavasour's house is unknown although drawings by Robert Smythson and his son John exist. The Lauderdales first consulted William Bruce, a cousin of the Duchess, but ultimately employed William Samwell to undertake their rebuilding. Ham retains many original Jacobean and Caroline features and furnishings, most in an unusually fine condition, and is a \"rare survival of 17th-century luxury and taste\". The house is a Grade I listed building and received museum accreditation from Arts Council England in 2015. Its park and formal gardens are listed at Grade II*. Bridget Cherry, in the revised London: South Pevsner published in 2002, acknowledged that the exterior of Ham was \"not as attractive as other houses of this period\", but noted the interior's \"high architectural and decorative interest\". The critic John Julius Norwich described the house as a \"time machine â enclosing one in the elegant, opulent world of van Dyck and Lely\".\n\n\n== The builders ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\n\nIn the early 17th century the manors of Ham and Petersham were bestowed by James I on his son, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales. The original construction of Ham House was completed in 1610 by Sir Thomas Vavasour, Knight Marshal to James I. The Thames-side location was ideal for Vavasour, allowing him to move between the palaces at Richmond, Hampton, London and Windsor as his court role required. It originally comprised an H-plan layout consisting of nine bays and three storeys, as shown in a 1649 miniature by Alexander Marshal, but the lack of estate documentation makes it impossible to verify the names of persons involved in the design and construction of the house. Robert Smythson's survey drawing of the house and gardens is a key record of the early structure. Prince Henry died in 1612, and the lands passed to James's second son, Charles, several years before his coronation in 1625. After Vavasour's death in 1620, the house was granted to John Ramsay, 1st Earl of Holderness, until he died in 1626.\n\n\n=== William Murray, 1st Earl of Dysart (1643â55) ===\nIn 1626, Ham House was leased to William Murray, courtier, a close childhood friend and alleged whipping boy of Charles I. Murray's initial lease was for 39 years and, in 1631, a further 14 years were added. When Gregory Cole, a neighbouring landowner, had to sell his property in Petersham as part of the enclosure of Richmond Park in 1637, he made over the remaining leases on his land to Murray. Shortly afterwards William and his wife Katherine (or Catherine) engaged the services of skilled craftsmen, including the artist Francis Cleyn and the painter Matthew Goodrich (or Goodricke), to begin improvements on the house as befitting a Lord of the Manors of Ham and Petersham. He extended the Great Hall and added an arch that leads to the ornate cantilever staircase to create a processional route for guests as they approached the dining room on the first floor.  He remodelled the Long Gallery and added the adjoining Green Closet that was influenced by Charles I's own \"Cabbonett Room\" at Whitehall Palace, to which Murray had donated two pieces. As part of the Whitehall Group, Murray would have been in touch with the latest tastes in art and architecture at court.\n\nIn 1640 William was also granted a lease on the nearby Manor of Canbury, now in Kingston upon Thames, but in the run-up to civil war in 1641 he signed over the house to Katherine and his four daughters, appointing trustees to safeguard the estate for them. The principal of these was Thomas Bruce, 1st Earl of Elgin, a relative of his wife and an important Scottish Presbyterian, Parliamentarian supporter and ally of the Puritan party in London. Murray was raised to the peerage as Earl of Dysart in 1643, although his elevation appears not to have been confirmed at that time. As a Scottish title, the earldom could be inherited by daughters, as well as by sons.\nShortly after the outbreak of the Civil War, the house and estates were sequestrated, but persistent appeals by Katherine regained them in 1646 on payment of a Â£500 fine.\nKatherine skilfully defended her ownership of the house throughout the Civil War and Commonwealth, and it remained in the family's possession despite Murray's close ties with the Royalist cause. Katherine died at Ham on 18 July 1649 (Charles I had been executed on 30 January of the same year). The Parliamentarians sold off much of the Royal Estate, including the Manors of Ham and Petersham. These, including Ham House, were bought for Â£1,131.18s on 13 May 1650 by William Adams, the steward acting on behalf of Murray's eldest daughter, Elizabeth and her husband Sir Lionel Tollemache, 3rd Baronet of Helmingham Hall, Suffolk. Ham House became Elizabeth and Lionel's primary residence, as Murray was in exile abroad, predominantly in France.\n\n\n=== Elizabeth, Countess of Dysart (1655â98) and Sir Lionel Tollemache Bt. (1640â69) ===\nElizabeth and Lionel Tollemache were married in 1648.  He was from a family of Royalists who had estates in Suffolk, Northamptonshire and London, and they celebrated their union at Ham with a display of arms that can be seen in the spandrels of the arch above the main entrance to the house:  on the left an earl's coronet above the Tollemache horse's head and on the right the Tollemache argent a fret sable quartering Murray.\nWhen her father died in 1655 Elizabeth became the 2nd Countess of Dysart in her own right, but at that time during the Interregnum the title would have held little prestige. Of far more interest to the Protectorate authorities was the matter of Elizabeth's allegiance. Her parents' activities during the Civil War had raised suspicion among both Royalists and Parliamentarians, and similar speculation attached to Elizabeth, which was heightened when she began a close relationship with Oliver Cromwell in the early 1650s. Her family and connections provided the perfect cover for an agent, especially a double agent, and her movements were closely monitored by both Royalist and Parliamentarian spies.\nBetween 1649 and 1661, Elizabeth bore eleven children, five of whom survived to adulthood; Lionel, Thomas, William, Elizabeth, and Catherine. Elizabeth and Lionel made few substantial changes to the house during this busy time. On the Restoration in 1660, Charles II rewarded Elizabeth with a pension of Â£800 for life and, while many of the Parliamentarian sales of Royal lands were put aside, Elizabeth retained the titles to the Manors of Ham and Petersham. In addition, in about 1665, following William's death, Lionel was granted freehold of 75 acres (30 ha; 0.117 sq mi) of land in Ham and Petersham including that surrounding the house and a 61-year lease of 289 acres (117 ha; 0.452 sq mi) of demesne lands. The grant was made in trust to Robert Murray for the daughters of the, then, late Earl of Dysart, \"in consideration of the service done by the late Earl of Dysart and his Daughter, and of the losses sustained by them by the enclosure of the New Park\". Lionel died in 1669, leaving his Ham and Petersham estate to Elizabeth along with Framsden Hall in Suffolk, which had been her jointure on their marriage.\n\n\n=== Elizabeth and John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale (1645â82) ===\n\nElizabeth may have become acquainted with John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale at some time in the 1640s, when he was one of the Scottish Commissioners on the Committee of Both Kingdoms who petitioned for her father's release on charges of treason in 1646. She felt sufficient gratitude towards him to claim in later years that she appealed to Cromwell to show clemency following his capture after the Battle of Worcester, a gesture Maitland repaid in his will when he left her Â£1,500 in gold for \"preserving my life when I was a prisoner in the year 1651\". They became much closer following the death of her husband and he began visiting Ham regularly.  Already a favourite of the King, he was appointed High Commissioner for Scotland in August 1669 which, on top of his political influence as Secretary of State and participation in Charles's Cabal ministry, made him one of the most powerful men in the country. In 1671 Lauderdale was granted by Letters patent full freehold rights to the Manors of Ham and Petersham and the 289 acres of leased land. In 1672 Elizabeth and Lauderdale were married, and soon afterwards he was created Duke of Lauderdale and Knight of the Garter. With Lauderdale's part in the Cabal Ministry, the family remained close to the heart of court intrigue.\n\n \nAs Duchess and consort to a very political Duke, Elizabeth had risen to the peak of Restoration society where she could exercise her many talents and interests.  Image was paramount and the Lauderdales began a programme of aggrandisement of their properties â Elizabeth consulted her cousin, William Bruce, and Maitland commissioned William Samwell, respectively amateur and professional architects.  Ham was extended on the south front with an enfilade of rooms created each side of a central axis around a new downstairs Dining Room.  Most grand houses at that time had apartments laid out in this way, comprising a suite of rooms approached one through the other.  The original plan was to create the Duchess's apartments to the left (east) and the Duke's to the right, she having two closets for privacy and entertainment and he having a staircase connecting his bedroom to the library above, but Elizabeth appears to have changed her mind while the rooms were being built and eventually each came to have a bedchamber within the other's apartment. This alteration may have been due to the installation of a bathroom downstairs which had to be near the kitchen (the source of hot water) in the basement at the Duke's end of the house.  Despite the swap of bedchambers, she retained her original closets at the east side of the house.\nClosets formed an exclusive and very private end to the sequence into which only the most important guests were invited.  Visitors knew that they would only progress through the rooms according to their rank or significance in society: being entertained in one of Elizabeth's closets would have been an honour.  Her White Closet was designed for entertaining and had a private door opening onto the Cherry Garden.  It was decorated in the most advanced tastes of the day and according to the 1679 inventory that it had \"one Indian furnace for tee garnish'd wt silver\", a luxury at a time when tea was only beginning to be drunk outside of exclusive royal residences. For this reason, too Elizabeth kept her tea secure in a \"Japan box\" in her adjoining Private Closet.\nUpstairs the existing State Apartments (Great Dining Room, North Drawing Room and Long Gallery) were extended with the addition of a State Bedroom apartment.  The bedchamber itself was being referred to as \"the Queen's Bedchamber\" in 1674 which suggests that Queen Catherine of Braganza, a friend of Elizabeth's, had occupied it at least once. This was the most important room in the house and the focal point towards which one progressed on the first floor. Another benefit of transforming the house from single to double-pile  â a \"pile\" is a row of rooms, single-pile houses have only one row while double-pile houses are two rows deep, often with a corridor between the rows â  had been that it allowed the creation of hidden passages and staircases for servants who could now enter rooms via discreet jib doors rather than by moving through one room to get to another. Michael Wilson notes the \"positive warren\" of such passages at Ham.\nThe eldest daughter of Elizabeth and Lionel, also named Elizabeth (1659â1735), married Archibald Campbell, 1st Duke of Argyll in Edinburgh in 1678. Their first child, John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll, was born at Ham House in 1680; their second son, Archibald Campbell, 3rd Duke of Argyll was born there a few years later.\nThe glorious years for the Lauderdales began to wane in 1680 when the Duke had a stroke and his influence declined. On his death in 1682 he left the Ham and Petersham property to Elizabeth, thereby securing the estate for the Tollemache dynasty. However, Elizabeth also inherited her husband's debts including mortgages on his former properties in England and Scotland and her latter years were marred by a financial dispute with her brother-in-law, Charles Maitland, 3rd Earl of Lauderdale. Even the intervention of the newly crowned James II failed to reconcile them and the matter was finally settled in her favour in the Scottish courts in 1688. Although this may have suppressed Elizabeth's lavish lifestyle, she went on to make further alterations to the house at Ham, opening the Hall ceiling and creating the Round Gallery in about 1690. As she got older her movements became restricted by gout and she rarely went upstairs, living mainly in what had been the Duke's apartments, but her intellect remained and she liked to be kept informed about events at court and in politics. Elizabeth Maitland continued to live at Ham House until her death in 1698 at the age of 72.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nHam House is a brick building of three storeys and nine bays, with a hip roof and ashlar dressings, representing two distinctively different architectural styles and periods. Michael Wilson, referencing Ham in his work, The English Country House and its furnishings, considers the later 17th century as the finest period of English brick building. The first phase is the original main house facing north-east to the river Thames, built in 1610 in the early Jacobean English renaissance style on a traditional H-plan for Thomas Vavasour, Knight Marshal at the court of James I. Simon Jenkins, in his study, England's Thousand Best Houses, records that the original entrance had a tower over the porch and flanking, projecting turrets, which were removed in subsequent reconstruction, and suggests that Vavasour's original house may have been of an E-plan type. John Julius Norwich also notes the original configuration of the north front, which he considers \"forbidding\", and the \"damson-coloured\" brickwork. Bridget Cherry and Nikolaus Pevsner, in the London: South volume of the Buildings of England series, record the \"not specially impressive\" nature of the remaining doorway but are clear that Ham was built to an H-plan. The architect of Vavasour's house is not known although survey drawings by Robert and John Smythson exist.\nThe second phase of reconstruction is the ambitious expansion to the south or garden side of the original house by the Duke and Duchess of Lauderdale in 1672 to display their high status in the court of King Charles II. They infilled the space between the southern wings of the H-plan building, almost doubling the volume of the house. Jenkins considers the Lauderdales' remodelling one of the earliest examples in England of the creation of a suite of state rooms for the accommodation and entertainment of royalty. Although the Lauderdales initially consulted William Bruce, the architect ultimately employed to undertake the reconstruction of their south front was William Samwell. Bruce did design the gates fronting the Thames on the north facade.  \nThe northern faÃ§ade retains the Jacobean arched loggias on either side of the front door and also includes an array of marble and lead busts, which continue into the flanking courtyard walls. The southern Caroline faÃ§ade is loosely based on a classical style introduced from the continent by the architect Inigo Jones (1573â1652). At the time the Lauderdales' remodelling project was considered impressive, the faÃ§ades giving the impression of two separate houses, while the interior blends them harmoniously. Roger North, a contemporary aristocrat, amateur architect and critic, described the remodelling in his treatise, Of Building, and considered it as the best work he had seen. The renovation also included a very early installation of sash windows, a French invention which were refined with weights and pulleys in England. The east front of the house retains many of its 17th century windows, as well as the door to the Great Staircase and the door from the Duchess's private apartments to the cherry garden. The west front of the house contains a mixture of 17th and 18th century windows and has long served as the service entrance to the house. Structures such as the bake house, still house, bath house, dairy and ice house were located to the west of the house, although some no longer survive.\n\n\n=== Listing designations ===\nHistoric England is an organisation dedicated to the protection of England's historic environment and is responsible for the listing of buildings. There are three available designations: Grade I, Grade II* and Grade II, with the first being applied to buildings of \"exceptional interest\". The house is a Grade I listed building. Ham was also given Accredited Museum status in 2015, having demonstrated compliance with UK industry standards for museums and galleries. The Park and Garden has a Grade II* listing. A number of the surrounding features have a Grade II listing: the Forecourt, the entrance gates and railings, the Garden walls and gatepiers to the south, the Orangery (now used as a tea room), the Ice House, the service yard to the west of the house and the Gatehouse.\n\n\n=== Plan ===\n\n\n== Interiors and collections ==\n\n\n=== Introduction ===\nHam House is unusual in retaining much of its original 17th-century interior decoration, offering a rare experience of the style of the courts of Charles I and Charles II. Ham House's rooms display collections of 17th-century paintings, portraits and miniatures, in addition to cabinets, tapestries and furniture amassed and retained by generations of the Murray and Tollemache families. Geoffrey Beard, in his study, The National Trust Book of English Furniture, noted the extraordinarily high quality of the Lauderdales' furnishing of the house, undertaken with \"a lavishness which transcended even what was fitting to their exalted rank\". Bridget Cherry, in the London: South volume of the Pevsner Architectural Guides suggested that, while the exterior of Ham was \"not as attractive as other houses of this period\", the \"high architectural and decorative interest\" of its interior should be recognised. John Julius Norwich considered the interiors, a \"time machine â enclosing one in the elegant, opulent world of van Dyck and Lely\".\n\n\n=== Great Hall ===\n\nThis room forms part of the original 1610 construction and is off-set from the centre, in the English Gothic and Tudor tradition. During this time, the hall may have been used for both dining and entertainment. The distinctive black and white marble chequerboard flooring is also believed to date from the original construction. By the early 18th century the room had been expanded upwards by opening the ceiling to the room above, now known as the Round Gallery. The room contains a number of large and notable paintings.\n\nCharlotte Walpole, Countess of Dysart (1738â1789), by Sir Joshua Reynolds, was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1775.\nJohn Constable, a family friend, was commissioned to make copies of two family portraits: Anna Maria Lewis, Countess of Dysart (1745â1804) as Miranda, painted in 1823 after Joshua Reynolds and Lady Louisa Tollemache, Countess of Dysart (1745â1840), painted in 1823â25 after John Hoppner.\nHanging side by side are John Vanderbank's portraits of Lionel Tollemache, 4th Earl of Dysart (1708â1770) painted in 1730 and of his wife Lady Grace Carteret, Countess of Dysart (1713â1755), signed and dated 1737.\n\n\n=== Chapel ===\n\nFormerly the family's sitting room, this room was converted to a chapel during the major renovations of the 1670s. It was decorated with crimson velvet and damask wall hangings, which were changed to black velvet upon the Duke's death in 1682. While designed for Protestant worship, the chapel was used in the late 19th century by the wife of the 8th Earl for Roman Catholic services. The sumptuous and rare 17th-century textiles require that the light levels remain low, in order to minimise damage.\n\n\n=== Great Staircase ===\n\nThe Great Staircase, described by the historian Christopher Rowell as \"remarkable\" and \"apparently without a close parallel in the British Isles\", was created for William Murray at the east end of the Great Hall in 1638â39 as part of a series of improvements to the house which reflected his rising status at Court. An ornately carved archway marks the entrance from the Great Hall to the stairs, which were designed as a grand processional route giving access to the State Apartments on the first floor. The cantilever staircase rises over three floors above a square stairwell. The balustrade is composed of boldly hand-carved pierced wooden panels depicting trophies of war. Each panel is different, with varying images on each face of arms and armour, including a set of horse armour. The wide range of arms includes field guns with cannonballs and barrels of gunpowder, swords, shields, quivers of arrows and halberds. Dolphins, elephant heads, dragons and other fantastical creatures also appear on the dado panelling, together with military drums and trumpets. The martial theme of these panels is interspersed with drops of relief carvings of bay leaves, richly carved newel posts topped with baskets of fruit designed to carry candles or candelabra, and miniature swags decorating the outer string. Originally gilded and grained to resemble walnut, in the 19th century the balustrade and other woodwork were picked out in bronze, traces of which survive. According to Rowell, \"There is no other architectural wood carving on this scale and of such sophistication surviving from the late 1630s.\"\nA collection of 17th century copies of old master paintings in their original carved frames hangs on the staircase wall. Two were copied from originals in the collection of Charles I: Venus with Mercury and Cupid (The School of Love) by Correggio at the base of the stairs (the original in the National Gallery, London), while on the first floor landing there is a copy of The Venus Del Pardo (Venus and a Satyr) by Titian (the original in the Louvre, Paris).\n\n\n=== Round Gallery ===\nBefore the upward expansion of the Great Hall this room had served as the Great Dining Room, as created by William Murray in the 1630s. The ornate white plasterwork ceiling was created by Joseph Kinsman, master craftsman and member of the London Plasterers' Company. Engaged by the Royal Works at Goldsmith's Hall, Whitehall and Somerset House, he was employed by William Murray at Ham House during the 1637 renovation and creation of the State Apartments. The ceilings at Ham are the only surviving example of his work, showing the influence of Inigo Jones in their design of deep beams with rosettes at the intersections, enclosing geometric compartments. The white plaster high relief oval swags of luscious fruit, flowers and ribbons, including the odd worm, contrasted with the elaborate frieze which was originally coloured blue and gold.\nNotable paintings include Peter Lely's final portrait of Elizabeth, painted c. 1680, and the earlier double portrait, John Maitland, Duke of Lauderdale and Elizabeth Murray, Countess of Dysart and Duchess of Lauderdale painted by Lely c. 1675.\n\n\n=== North Drawing Room ===\n\nAfter dinner in the adjacent dining room, guests would have retired to the North Drawing Room for conversation. This room was decorated at the same time as the Great Dining Room, and was later hung with tapestries. Kinsman continued his elaborate plasterwork in the white ceiling in this room. Deep beams enclose rectangles bursting with individually crafted fruit and flowers. The hemispherical rosettes at the intersections are unusual, possibly unique.\nA notable piece of furniture in this room is the ivory cabinet: veneered in rippled ivory panels on the exterior and the interior, this large oak and cedar cabinet opens to reveal 14 drawers. An inner door conceals small drawers, further secret drawers and a compartment. It was recorded as being moved to the prestigious Queen's Bedchamber shortly after its appearance in the 1677 inventory and is considered the most impressive piece of furniture designed or bought for the house (with the exception of the State Bed, which no longer exists). The cabinet may have been made in the Northern Netherlands based on furniture inlaid in ivory brought back in 1644 by John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen, the former Governor of Dutch Brazil for his home in The Hague, now called the Mauritshuis. \nAlso notable in the room are a vibrant set of tapestries. James I established the Mortlake Tapestry Works in 1619 just three miles from Ham House, from which the Lauderdales had purchased a set of tapestries showing the seasons  incorporating gold thread for the Queen's Bedchamber. While these are no longer at the house, the 4th Earl of Dysart acquired a set woven in Lambeth in 1699â1719 by the ex-Mortlake weaver Stephen de May, probably to the Mortlake design. Altered to hang in the North Drawing Room, this set of The Seasons was originally commissioned by the 1st Lord Shelburne. Tapestries were important in Europe for comfort in draughty manor houses and as status objects because of their expense.  Sets with designs showing the seasons or months were popular and had a number of variations depicting appropriate seasonal activities such as milking for April, ploughing and sowing for September, and wine-making for October.\n\n\n=== Long Gallery ===\n\nThe Long Gallery was part of the original 1610 house, but was extensively redecorated in 1639 by William Murray. It has been used as an exercise space as well as a gallery to showcase portraits of family and important royal connections. Notable paintings include:\n\nSir John Maitland, 1st Baron Maitland of Thirlestane (1543â1595), aged 44 attributed to Adrian Vanson. In late 2016 an X-ray revealed that underneath the main painting was another, unfinished portrait likely of Mary, Queen of Scots, dated 1589âtwo years after her execution. According to the National Trust, this painting \"shows that portraits of the queen were being copied and presumably displayed in Scotland around the time of her execution, a highly contentious and potentially dangerous thing to be seen doing\".\nKing Charles I (1600â1649) by Sir Anthony van Dyck and studio. In recognition of their friendship this painting was given by Charles I to William Murray; a 1638â39 memorandum of pictures bought by the King from Van Dyck includes framed pictures, one of which is believed to be this portrait.\nColonel The Hon. John Russell (1620â1681) by John Michael Wright is signed and dated 1659.\nOf the 15 portraits by Peter Lely in Ham House, 11 are hung in the Long Gallery. These include Elizabeth Murray with a Black Servant, John Maitland, Duke of Lauderdale (1616â1682) in Garter robes, and Thomas Clifford, 1st Baron Clifford of Chudleigh KG (1630â1673) in Garter robes.\nPicture frames at Ham House date from the 17th century and its Long Gallery portraits are a showcase of elaborately carved, gilded frames in the auricular style (literally 'of the ear'). Two frames date from the 1630s, Charles I and Henrietta Maria. Later frames, for instance on the portraits of Elizabeth Murray with a Black Servant and Lady Margaret Murray, Lady Maynard are in a similar auricular style with straight sight edges. These frames, referred to as Sunderland frames, are distinguished by their irregular sight edges. They take their name from the 2nd Earl of Sunderland, who displayed many pictures at his estate Althorp framed in this style. There are examples of Sunderland frames on the portraits of John Maitland, Duke of Lauderdale (1616â1682) in Garter Robes and Colonel The Hon. John Russell (1620â1681).\nThis room also displays some notable furniture:\n\nFloral marquetry cabinet: Ham House has a number of tables and cabinets decorated with floral marquetry including this, the earliest inventoried example in England, dating from 1675. The naturalistic representations of flowers and fruit are cut from contrasting woods such as ebony, walnut and stained fruitwood and laid onto the carcass. The woods and other materials were often dyed to create a greater range of colours and the green leaves on this piece are made from stained ivory or bone. This cabinet, as well as other tables and a mirror in the house, is attributed by the National Trust to Gerrit Jensen, who was the cabinet maker in ordinary to Catherine of Braganza.\n\nJapanese lacquered cabinet: Japanese lacquered furniture was fashionable in the 17th century and this cabinet from 1650 remains in the Long Gallery where it has stood since then. Decorated with hills, trees and birds in raised gold and silver lacquer, the doors open on engraved brass hinges to reveal 10 drawers. The giltwood stand has four legs carved as elephant trunks topped with winged cherub busts.\n\nChinese lacquered chest: China was another Asian source of lacquered furniture in the 17th century. Decorated with watery landscapes and branches, this chest is lacquered in gold and red on a dark crimson ground. It was a standard form of storage chest for linens and other textiles. The English stand c. 1730 is japanned, a technique developed by English and European craftsmen to approximate the hard, smooth and shiny surfaces of popular Asian lacquered goods.\n\n\n=== Green Closet ===\n\nUsed for the display of miniature paintings and smaller-scale furniture, in contrast to the Long Gallery, this room is a very rare survival of a room in the style of Charles I's court. In the 1630s the Green Closet was specifically designed by William Murray to display miniatures and small paintings. The ceiling paintings are tempera on paper, and represent some of Franz Cleyn's best surviving work. Two preliminary drawings for the capricci of putti by Cleyn and an associate are held by the University of Southampton.\nToday it contains 87 items including Queen Elizabeth I (1533â1603) painted c. 1590 by Nicholas Hilliard, and A Man Consumed by Flames painted c. 1610 by Isaac Oliver.\n\n\n=== Library ===\n\nThe Library dates from the 1672â74 enlargement of the house. The architectural historian Mark Girouard considers it probably \"the oldest country house library\" still in existence. Although some shelves were moved from what is now the Queen's Antechamber, most of the cedar fixed furniture, including the secretaire, was provided by Henry Harlow. The Duke of Lauderdale added substantially to the contents: he was an avid reader and collector (so much so that his Highgate house was said to be in danger of collapse due to the weight of his substantial book collection), and he owed huge sums to booksellers when he died. Mark Purcell, in his 2017 study The Country House Library, notes that the probate inventory undertaken on the Duke's death estimated the value of his books at half of the total worth of the house's chattels. Many volumes were sold at auctions between 1688 and 1692, in part due to the Duchess's money difficulties upon the Duke's death.\nLater members of the family rebuilt the collection, notably the 4th Earl who bought at the Harleian auction and elsewhere. He acquired 12 books printed by William Caxton and many other incunabula; in 1904 a visitor, William Younger Fletcher, described the library as containing books of greater value, in proportion to its size, than any other in Europe. Most of the books were sold in 1938, and the bulk of the remainder after the Second World War. A notable exception, a Book of Common Prayer from Whitehall Palace, is sometimes on display in the chapel.\nAfter the war Norman Norris, a Brighton book dealer, assembled a collection of books from a range of post-war country house sales. He bequeathed the collection to the National Trust and many eventually came to Ham, primarily those pre-dating the mid-18th century. One, Jus Parliamentarium, which has the Dysart coat of arms on its cover, is from the Dysart collection. The ceiling and friezes in the room display a lively naturalism. Two globes with rare leather covers (acquired in 1745 and 1746) and two fire screens (1743) are notable.\n\n\n=== Queen's Apartments ===\nThis suite of three rooms, now referred to as the Queen's Apartments, was created by the Duke and Duchess of Lauderdale when the house was enlarged in 1673. Intended for use by Catherine of Braganza, they reflect the latest innovations from France, where royalty received important visitors in the State Bedchamber. The rooms are decorated with increasing splendour, beginning with the relatively modest Antechamber, culminating in the small but richly gilded and decorated Queen's Closet.\n\n\n==== Antechamber ====\nThe first of the suite of rooms is the antechamber, where visitors would wait for an audience with the Queen. The ceiling of this waiting room is the first of the three ceilings by the plasterer Henry Wells. A circular garland of leaves is thickly studded with small flowers, surrounded by four spandrels containing foliage and ribbons. The oak parquet floor, an innovation from France, continues through to the far side of the Queen's Bedchamber where it is then replaced with a more elaborate marquetry design where the State Bed would have stood. The blue velvet and damask wall hangings, installed during the period 1679â1683, are extremely rare survivals.\n\n\n==== Queen's Bedchamber ====\n\nThis room, built on the central axis of the house, was designed for the reception of guests and visiting dignitaries who would have waited to be summoned from the Antechamber. The State Bed stood prominently on a raised dais at the east end of the room facing the door. A balustrade separated the bed from the main area of the room where visitors may have gathered for their audience with the Queen. The bed was on an elaborate marquetry floor inlaid with the cipher and ducal coronet of the Duke and Duchess of Lauderdale, their initials J, E and L entwined in cedar and walnut, a feature that repeats in the Queens's Closet. The floor remains in excellent condition. This ceiling has the richest plaster decoration in the house, a large deep oval of bay leaves dotted with roses. These cluster more densely at the east end, above the area of the Queen's State Bed. The spandrels are also more decorative, acanthus leaves swirl to fill the panels, each corner hiding a grotesque figure among the foliage or bursting from the flowers.\nThe bed had been removed by 1728 and the rooms were closed and rarely used, contributing to their excellent state of preservation. The change of use to a drawing room took place in the midâ18th century with the lowering of the dais in line with the rest of the floor, and the purchase of new furniture and a set of William Bradshaw's popular early 18th century pastoral tapestries. Woven in 1734â40 for Henry O'Brien, 8th Earl of Thomond, and purchased in 1742 for Â£184 on behalf of the 4th Earl of Dysart, the tapestries needed only slight alterations to fit three of the walls of his newly decorated drawing room. Bradshaw's signature can be seen on The Dance tapestry. Woven in Soho, London, the four wool and silk tapestries have narrow borders in the style of picture frames and are thought to incorporate several different images from works by the French painters Antoine Watteau, Nicolas Lancret and Jean-Baptiste Pater.\n\n\n==== Queen's Closet ====\nThe smallest, most intimate of the suite of rooms, the third and final room was designed for private use and could be closed off, away from the business of the State Bedchamber. Rarely used and preserved largely intact, the decoration, textiles and furniture give a unique record of late 17th century interior decoration. The marquetry floor incorporating the ducal coronet and cipher continues from the Bedchamber into the Closet. The ceiling painting of Ganymede and the Eagle is in the style of the Italian artist Antonio Verrio (1636â1707). Framed by a plaster garland, following the designs of the previous rooms, the richness of the effect is emphasised by gilding of the roses. Three ceiling paintings, again in the style of Verrio, of cupids sprinkling flowers, are partly hidden from view above the alcove. The elaborate chimney piece, hearth and windowsill, again including the Lauderdale cipher and ducal coronet, are made from scagliola, possibly the earliest documented example of scagliola in this country.\n\n\n=== Private Closet ===\n\nThis was the Duchess's most private and intimate room where she would read, write and entertain her closest family and friends. The elaborate oil on plaster ceilings in both of the Duchess's closets are by Antonio Verrio. They are among his earliest commissions in England, and his earliest surviving work following his arrival from France in 1672. As his reputation grew he was commissioned by royal and aristocratic clients for larger projects including for Charles II at Windsor Castle, interiors for the Earl of Exeter at Burghley House and for William III at Hampton Court. The ceiling painting of The Penitent Magdalene Surrounded by Putti Holding Emblems of Time, Death and Eternity was completed around 1675. The central figure floats above the room, circled by three putti carrying symbols of time (an hourglass), death (a skull), and eternity (a snake eating its own tail). Verrio linked the ceiling design to the room by enclosing it in a narrow painted grey marble surround, matching the marble fireplace. The room also contains a portrait of Catherine Bruce, Mrs William Murray (d. 1649), by John Hoskins the Elder, a watercolour on vellum in an ebony travelling case, signed and dated 1638.\n\n\n=== White Closet ===\nAdjoining the Private Closet and richly decorated, this room was used by the Duchess for relaxing and entertaining, its double glazed door leading out to the Cherry Garden. The coved ceiling of this glamorous room, originally decorated with white silk hangings and marble effect walls, emphasises the advanced taste of the Duke and Duchess of Lauderdale in a room intended for their most important visitors. Painted by Verrio in oil on plaster in 1673/74, it is described by the art historians Peter Thornton and Maurice Tomlin as \"decorated with one of the earliest examples of Baroque illusionism to have been executed in a domestic interior in this country\". Putti climb up over a trompe l'oeil balustrade to reach the figures of Divine Wisdom Presiding Over The Liberal Arts, represented by seven mainly female figures bearing the symbols of Verrio's version of the liberal arts. The figure of Wisdom floats on clouds pointing to the all-seeing eye in the open sky above. Verrio linked the ceiling design to the room by enclosing it in a narrow painted red marble surround, matching the red marble fireplace, as in the Private Closet. The heavily gilded coving includes medallions of the four Cardinal virtues. Notable collection items include:\n\nHam House from the South (1675â79) by Hendrick Danckerts depicts a finely dressed couple (possibly the Duke and Duchess of Lauderdale) in front of the south front and formal gardens, and was set into the chimneypiece in the White Closet shortly after the building was completed.\nEscritoire of kingwood oysterwork: this elegant oak scriptor (c. 1672â75) is veneered with South American kingwood using the oystering technique and features silver mounts. Made for the Duchess of Lauderdale, it is listed in the 1679 inventory of Ham House and is believed to have been made in London by a French or Dutch craftsman. Kingwood was one of the most expensive woods used in furniture making in the 17th century.\n\n\n=== Marble Dining Room ===\n\nSince 1675 the walls of the Marble Dining Room have been decorated with leather panels. Today visitors can see two distinct designs. The earlier design of 1675 complemented the original black and white marble floor, for which the room is named, with brightly coloured Flemish leather panels of fruits and flowers such as tulips and roses mixed with birds and butterflies on a white background. These had been embossed and some elements gilded, giving the room a sumptuous look.\nIn 1756, the 4th Earl removed the marble floor and replaced it with a fine marquetry floor of tropical hardwoods. He also commissioned John Hutton of London to make a new set of leather wall hangings with an embossed diaper rosette surrounded by four leaves. The parts of the design which are now brown would originally have appeared to be gold, made by varnishing silver leaf in yellow. The fashion for leather wall decoration spread from Spain and the Spanish Netherlands in the 17th century and was considered ideal for dining rooms as leather did not become impregnated with the odours of food like the fabric of a tapestry. The Ham House inventory of 1655 indicates the \"two parlers facing the river were hung with gilt leather.\"\n\n\n=== Withdrawing Room ===\n\nAfter dining in the adjacent Marble Dining Room, guests would retire to this space for entertainment and conversation. It also served as an antechamber to the adjacent bedchamber. Notable in this room is the ebony and tortoiseshell cabinet:  this cabinet (c. 1650â1675) on a possibly 19th century stand features red tortoiseshell decoration on a somewhat austere ebonised pine exterior that does not prepare the viewer for the ornate interior. Two doors open to reveal multiple shallow drawers on either side of an architectural exterior, which then opens to a theatrical set framed by golden pillars and mirrors. Known as the Antwerp cabinet, it is embellished with ivory, pietra paesina (a type of naturally patterned limestone) and gilt bronze and brass.\n\n\n=== Duchess's Bedchamber ===\nOriginally the Duke's bedchamber, it is believed it became the Duchess's bedchamber following the installation of the bathroom which is accessed via the door to the left of the bed alcove. The ceiling above the bed in the alcove is painted in the style of Antonio Verrio and shows the partially clothed Flora Attended by Cupids floating above the tester of the four poster bed. The monogram initials J, E and L (John, Elizabeth, Lauderdale) are entwined in each corner. Notable paintings include:\n\nElizabeth Murray (1626â1698) painted by Peter Lely in 1648, the year of her marriage to Lionel Tollemache.\n\nA set of four overdoor maritime paintings by Willem van de Velde the Younger, signed and dated 1673, including Calm: An English Frigate at Anchor Firing a Salute, which remain from the decoration scheme planned for the room's use as the Duke's bedchamber.\n\n\n=== Back Parlour ===\nThis was the room in which senior male staff would have eaten their meals and spent any free time. Hanging in this room is: Elizabeth Murray, Countess of Dysart (1626â1698), with her First Husband, Sir Lionel Tollemache (1624â1669), and her Sister, Margaret Murray, Lady Maynard (c. 1638â1682) painted c. 1648 by Joan Carlile, a friend and neighbour to the Murrays.\n\n\n== Garden and grounds ==\n\nThe gardens and pleasure grounds at Ham cover approximately 12 hectares (30 acres). They follow an axial plan, with avenues originally leading east, west and south from the house. The fourth, northern, side of the estate fronts the River Thames. The listed avenues leading to the house from the A307 are formed by more than 250 trees stretching east from the house to the 19th-century Jacobethan gate house at Petersham, and south across the open expanse of Ham Common where it is flanked by a pair of more modest gatehouses. A third avenue to the west no longer exists, and the view to and from the Thames completes the principal approaches to the house. The gardens and grounds are listed Grade II* on Historic England's Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England. From the initial survey drawings produced by Robert Smythson and son in 1609, it is clear that the garden design was considered as important as that of the house and that the two were intended to be in harmony. The original design shows the house set within a range of walled gardens, each with different formal designs as well as an orchard and vegetable garden. Uncertainty remains as to how much of the original design was actually realised; nevertheless, the plans illustrate the influence of the French formal garden of the time, with its emphasis on visual effects and perspectives.\n\nThe 1671 plans for the renovation undertaken by the Duke and Duchess of Lauderdale, which have been attributed to John Slezer and Jan Wyck, demonstrate the continued importance of the garden design, with many features that exist today such as the Orangery, the Cherry Garden, the Wilderness and eight grass squares (plats) on the south side of the house. Both the private apartments for the Duke and Duchess and the State Apartments added to the south front of the house were designed to overlook the formal gardens, an innovation that was highly commended by contemporaries. John Evelyn remarked favourably on the garden design observed during his August 1678 visit, noting \"...the Parterres, Flower Gardens, Orangeries, Growves, Avenues, Courts, Statues, Perspectives, Fountaines, Aviariesâ¦\". The Duchess also commissioned a set of iron gates for the north entrance to the property, which remain in place today.\nThe 3rd and 4th Earls of Dysart who subsequently inherited the estate maintained the formal garden features into the 18th century, while also planting avenues of trees in the wider vicinity. After inheriting the estate in 1799, the 6th Earl opened the north front of the property to the river and installed the Coade stone statue of the River God at the front of the house. He also created the ha-ha which runs along the north entrance of the property. Louisa Tollemache, 7th Countess of Dysart, inherited the estate upon her brother's death and was acquainted with the artist John Constable, who completed a sketch of Ham House from the south gardens during a visit in 1835.\n\nBy 1972, the gardens had become greatly overgrown â large bay trees at the front blocked the view of the busts in their niches, the south lawn had reverted to a single large expanse of grass and the Wilderness was overgrown with rhododendrons and sycamore trees. Work to restore the 17th century design to the eastern and southern parts of the garden began in 1975. In 1974, an exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum entitled \"The Destruction of the Country House\" had included a model of Ham House with its gardens shown according to the 1672 plans created by Ms. Lucy (Henderson) Askew. This model illustrated the details of the 17th-century design in terms of both layout and plant selection and was used to garner support for the restoration project. By 1977, the grass plats and the structure of the Wilderness to the south of the house were re-established. The 1675 painting by Hendrick Danckerts showing the Duke and Duchess in the south gardens was used to guide the restoration of the furniture and statues now in place.\nIn approaching the restoration of the \"cherry garden\" on the east side of the house, there was less documentary evidence available to guide the design. A set of diagonally-set parterres outlined by box hedges and cones were planted with lavender, with the whole garden being enclosed by tunnel arbours and double yew hedges. Later archaeological studies completed in the 1980s indicated no evidence of formal gardens in this area prior to the 20th century; despite this finding, the National Trust's Gardens Panel decided not to remove the garden, but rather allow it to remain so long as visitors to the property were clearly informed of its origins. The focus of garden restoration since 2000 has been the walled kitchen garden to the west of the house, to restore its use as a supply of fresh fruit, vegetables and flowers. The produce is used in the Orangery cafe, while the flowers are used to decorate the house. The garden itself is also used as an exhibition space, with information about tulip varieties and the range of edible flowers.\n\n\n== Later owners ==\n\n\n=== Lionel Tollemache, 3rd Earl of Dysart (1698â1727) ===\nElizabeth and Lionel Tollemache's eldest son and heir, Lionel, became 3rd Earl of Dysart on his mother's death in 1698, inheriting Ham House, the adjoining estates and the manors of Ham and Petersham. Already the owner of his father's estates in Suffolk and Northamptonshire, he had also acquired 20,000 acres (8,100 ha; 31 sq mi) in Cheshire through his marriage in 1680 to Grace, daughter of Sir Thomas Wilbraham, 3rd Baronet. He only spent short periods at Ham, and apparently did little for the upkeep of the house though he kept the garden well. He did use his wealth to pay off the interest on the outstanding mortgages but was not considered generous, even with his immediate family. His only son, Lionel, predeceased him in 1712 and on his death he was succeeded as Earl of Dysart by his grandson, also named Lionel.\n\n\n=== Lionel, 4th Earl (1727â70) ===\n\nLionel Tollemache was only 18 years old when he became the 4th Earl of Dysart and head of the family in 1727.  Shortly after returning from the Grand Tour in 1729 he married Grace Carteret, the 16-year-old daughter of John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville, and began repairing existing furniture as well as commissioning new pieces for his properties at Ham and at Helmingham Hall] in Suffolk.  Ham House had been largely neglected since the death of Elizabeth; in 1730 he ordered a structural survey of the building from John James which revealed serious problems, especially on the north front.  Repairs began in the 1740s.  At the front of the house the \"Advance\", a projecting frontispiece which extended two storeys to form a porch over the main entrance, had become detached from the wall and was in danger of pulling down the roof. It was removed completely and the stone reused for repairs to the first and second floors.  The canted bays on the projections at each end of the house were rebuilt as deeper three-window bays, with corresponding alterations made to the bays on the south front. Major repairs were also made to the roof, where old unfashionable red tiles on the outer pitches were replaced with slate and reused for repairs to the inner pitches where they would not be visible.\nMuch new furniture was commissioned, but the 4th Earl seems to have also been committed to preserving existing artefacts, making repairs to fixtures from the Lauderdale period where necessary. He made three large changes to the interior of the house: the Queen's Bedchamber on the first floor became the principal drawing room with furniture and tapestries supplied by the London upholsterer and textile producer William Bradshaw; the Volury on the ground floor became another drawing room with the addition of tapestries and its distinctive X-framed seat furniture; and in the Dining Room the marble floor was replaced with marquetry, with matching gilded leather panels on the walls. By means of his extensive investment, the house would have become sumptuously furnished by the mid-18th century.\nOf the sixteen children of the 4th Earl and Countess, only seven lived to maturity. Three of their five sons died in the pursuit of their naval careers. The Countess died in 1755 aged 42, and the Earl in 1770 aged 61. He was survived by his sons Lionel, Lord Huntingtower, and Wilbraham, as well as three daughters: Jane, Louisa and Frances.\n\n\n=== Lionel, 5th Earl (1770â99) ===\nLionel Tollemache, 5th Earl of Dysart succeeded to the title in 1770 on his father's death. Despite spending on the house, the 4th Earl had kept his son short of money during his lifetime, causing friction in the relationship; he married without his father's consent. His wife, Charlotte, was the youngest illegitimate daughter of Sir Edward Walpole, second son of Robert Walpole, and niece of Horace Walpole who lived near to Ham across the Thames at Strawberry Hill. The 5th Earl seems to have been a reclusive and introverted individual who shunned publicity, preferring to remain on his estates and refusing to allow changes or renovations to Ham House.  His aversion to visitors was so marked as to lead him to refuse a request to visit from George III; \"whenever my house becomes a public spectacle, His Majesty shall certainly have the first view\". In contrast to his conserving instincts at Ham, he demolished two properties in Northamptonshire and Cheshire, although retaining the productive, and lucrative, estates. He continued the family tradition of acquiring fine furniture, most notably a marquetry commode which can be seen in the Queen's Bedchamber, and the sunburst chairs in the White Closet.\nCharlotte died, childless, in 1789 and although Lionel remarried he remained without an heir. The families of his surviving sisters, Louisa and Jane, reverted to the family name of Tollemache in anticipation of eventual succession. On his death in 1799 his brother, Wilbraham became the 6th Earl of Dysart.\n\n\n=== Wilbraham, 6th Earl (1799â1821) ===\n\nWilbraham was aged 60 when he inherited the title in 1799. One of his first acts was to buy the rights of the Manor of Kingston/Canbury from George Hardinge, extending the Dysarts' property south into Kingston. He had the wall which isolated the property and separated Ham House from the river demolished and replaced by a ha-ha, leaving the gates free-standing. Coade stone pineapples were added to decorate the balustrades to the north of the property and John Bacon's statue of the river god which is placed in front of the north entrance, pictured here, also in Coade stone, dates from this period. Several busts of Roman emperors which had adorned the now-demolished walls since the 17th century were relocated to niches in the front of the house. Further restoration of the old furniture took place as well as the addition of Jacobean reproductions. The 6th Earl became a patron of John Constable at this time. Wilbraham's wife died in 1804 and, devastated, he moved away, close to the estate in Cheshire. Wilbraham died without heir in 1821, aged 82.\n\n\n=== Louisa, 7th Countess (1821â40) ===\n\nOf the 4th Earl's children, only the eldest daughter, Lady Louisa, by then widow of John Manners MP, was still surviving when her brother Wilbraham, the 6th Earl, died. Already heiress to Manners' 30,000 acres (12,000 ha; 47 sq mi) at Buckminster Park, Louisa inherited the title and estates at Ham in 1821 at the age of 76. The remaining Tollemache estates were bequeathed to the heirs of Lady Jane. Louisa continued the patronage of John Constable who was a frequent and welcome visitor to Ham. Increasingly infirm and blind in old age, Louisa lived to the age of 95, dying in 1840.\n\n\n=== Lionel, 8th Earl (1840â1878) ===\nLouisa's eldest son, William, had predeceased her in 1833. Her grandson, Lionel William John Tollemache, inherited the title and became the 8th Earl of Dysart in 1840. Lionel preferred to live in London and invited his brothers, Frederick and Algernon Gray Tollemache, to manage the estates and Ham and Buckminster. Lionel became increasingly reclusive and eccentric. Lionel's only son, William, a controversial figure who amassed great debts guaranteed by the expectation of inheriting the family fortune also predeceased his father, who subsequently bequeathed the estates to his grandson William John Manners Tollemache, with the 8th Earl's brothers Frederick and Algernon along with Charles Hanbury-Tracy acting as trustees until 1899. Following the 8th Earl's death, his son's creditors brought an action in the High Court against the Tollemache family who ultimately had to pay a sum of Â£70,000 to avoid forfeiting much of the Ham estate.\n\n\n=== William, 9th Earl (1878â1935) ===\nThe 9th Earl inherited in 1878. In his autobiography, Augustus Hare recounts a visit to Ham House the following year, contrasting the dilapidation and disrepair of the house and estate with the treasures the house still contained. Shortly afterwards, the 9th Earl, with agreement from the trustees, undertook extensive renovation of the house and its contents and by 1885 it was again in a suitable state to host social activities, notably a garden party to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887. In 1890 Ada Sudeley, a niece of the 8th Earl, published her 570-page book Ham House, Belonging to the Earl of Dysart.\nOn 23 September 1899, full control of the Tollemache estates at Ham and Buckminster was transferred from trustees to the 9th Earl, then aged about 40, in accordance with his grandfather's will. By the early 1900s the Dysarts had installed electricity and central heating at the house along with other modern gadgets including, in the Duchess's basement bathroom, a bath with jets and even a wave machine. The 9th Earl travelled widely, rode despite blindness, invested successfully in the stock market, and while eccentric and difficult, nonetheless was hospitable and supportive of the local community. His cantankerous nature proved too much for his wife who left him in the early 1900s but he lived on with other family members at Ham for many years. In the 1920s and 1930s he employed a staff of up to 20 including a chauffeur for his four cars including a Lanchester and Rolls-Royce. When he died in 1935 he left investments worth Â£4,800,000 but had no direct heir. He was the last Earl of Dysart to live at the house.\n\n\n=== Sir Lyonel Tollemache, Bt. (1935â52) ===\nOn the 9th Earl's death in 1935, his inheritance passed to the families of his sisters. His niece, Wynefrede, daughter of his sister Agnes, inherited the earldom. Wynefrede's cousin, Lyonel, at the age of 81, inherited the baronetcy and the estates at Ham and Buckminster. He and his middle-aged son, Cecil Lyonel Newcomen Tollemache, lived at the house, but the lack of available staff during the Second World War added to the difficulty of maintaining it. The nearby Hawker Siddeley aircraft factory was a target for bombing raids, and the house and grounds suffered some minor damage. Much of the house's contents were removed to the countryside for safety. Most of the family papers were deposited in Chancery Lane but, while they survived the Blitz, they suffered significant water damage from fire hoses. Thought for some time to have been lost, an additional set of papers was subsequently recovered from the Ham House stables in 1953, though many were in poor condition from inadequate storage conditions.\n\n\n=== National Trust (1948âpresent) ===\nIn 1943, Sir Lyonel invited the National Trust's first Historic Buildings Secretary, James Lees-Milne, to visit the house. Lees-Milne saw the neglected state of the house and grounds but, even though devoid of its contents, the historical importance of the underlying estate was immediately apparent. He recorded his impressions in his diary for 1947, extracts from which were later reproduced in the volume Some Country Houses and their Owners: \"The grounds are indescribably overgrown and unkempt. All the rooms are dirty and dusty. The garden and front doors look as they had not been used for decades.\" Despite the neglect, a report commissioned by Lees-Milne in 1946 concluded that it was \"by far the finest, most valuable and most representative building of the period to which it belongs in the United Kingdom\". Following lengthy negotiations, Sir Lyonel and his son donated the house and its grounds to the Trust in 1948. The stables and other outlying buildings were sold privately and much of the remaining estate was auctioned in 1949.\nThe National Trust at first transferred ownership of Ham House to the state on a long lease to the Ministry of Works. The contents of the house were purchased by the government who entrusted them to the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A) after considerable urging by the director of the museum, Sir Leigh Ashton. His efforts were essential because the National Land Fund, which had been established in 1946 through the sale of surplus war materials, allowed for the purchase of property but not art or other interior furnishings. The legislation was amended in 1953, following the agreement that properties such as Ham House ought to retain their historic collections.\nBy 1950, the house was open to the public and a series of research and restoration works since undertaken, restoring and reproducing much of the house's former grandeur. The arrival of Peter Thornton as the Keeper of the Furniture Department at the V&A led to a new approach in the management of the collection; efforts focused on arranging pieces within the house according to the documented history of the property, rather than treating individual items as simply part of the museum inventory. Research on historic interiors emerged as a discipline from the late 1960s, with an important source made available through the publication of the Ham House bills and inventories in 1980.\nThe government relinquished its lease in 1990, and the compensation was used to form a fund to support maintenance. The collections were fully transferred from the V&A to the National Trust in 2002. Since that time, the National Trust has invested in recreating the period interiors of the house by rehanging the collection and placing furniture according to inventory records as well as commissioning replica textiles based on archival descriptions. To celebrate the 400th anniversary of the property, a symposium was held to stimulate interest in new research; this led to the publication of a major historical survey overseen by Christopher Rowell in 2013. The Trust continues to acquire items at auction with a historical connection to the house, such as paintings which were formerly in the collection. Restoration is an additional area of major investment, such as that completed for the Queen's Antechamber wallhangings in 2010. In its 2018/2019 Annual Report, the Trust reported that Ham received 127,195 visitors.\n\n\n== In film and television ==\nHam House is a popular film location. It has also appeared in television and radio programmes. Films that have used the house and its grounds include: Left Right and Centre (1959), Spice World (1997), The Young Victoria (2009), Never Let Me Go (2010), Anna Karenina (2012), John Carter (2012), A Little Chaos (2014), Victoria and Abdul (2017), The Last Vermeer (2019), and Rebecca (2020). Television programmes filmed at Ham include: Steptoe and Son (1964), Sense and Sensibility (2008), Taboo (2017), Bodyguard (2018), Belgravia (2020), The Great (2020), Antiques Roadshow (2021), and Mary & George (2024).\n\n\n== Access ==\nThe house can be reached by public transport and is located in Transport for London travel zone 4; from Richmond station (London) the 65 bus service serves Petersham Road and the 371 bus service serves Sandy Lane. These routes terminate near Kingston station. There is a free council car park north-west of the house, next to the Thames. Hammerton's Ferry, to the north-east, links to a playground between Orleans House Gallery and Marble Hill House below Twickenham's central embankment. The house is accessible to pedestrians and cyclists via the Thames Path national trail.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nEdwards, Ralph; Ward-Jackson, Peter (1959).

It incorporates the tower of All Hallows Lombard Street and is prominently south of a major road of west London, near Twickenham Stadium, specifically the Chertsey Road (A316).\nThe church took many structures of Sir Christopher Wren's All Hallows Lombard Street in the City of London which was demolished in 1937; its stone square tower, bells, stone pillared cloister and many interior fittings and furnishings were moved to the site.\n\n\n== History and description ==\nFormer Mission\nIn community the church began as the continuation of St Martin's Mission Church, technically at first a chapel, which had stood for a few decades from 1914. Its building was at the south end of Whitton Road, beside Heatham House. It was demolished to host a beekeepers' association when the tower of Lombard Street was donated. St Martin's was a mission of the parish of St Mary the Virgin, Twickenham. In 1933, it gained its own priest in charge, Harold Schofield. Under his leadership the church gained its own parish and he was made vicar.\n\nFoundation of the church at Chertsey Road\nThe new features of the church were designed by Robert Atkinson as a modern build based on Wren's uncompleted plans for All Hallows Lombard Street. The foundation stone was laid by the Bishop of London, Arthur Winnington-Ingram, on 11 July 1939, and the new church was consecrated on 9 November 1940 by his successor Geoffrey Fisher. During its consecration, air-raid precautions were in place and anti-aircraft gun fire could be heard in the distance, leading the Bishop to say, \"churches are being destroyed by agencies more unnatural and vile than the Great Fire [which had all but destroyed a previous form of All Hallows Lombard Street]\".\nThe main body of the church is a brick-built basilica with a narthex leading through the cloister to the old tower to the north, and to St Martin's Chapel to the south. The Christopher Wren-designed tower houses a peal of ten bells, including some of those that were originally hung at St Dionis Backchurch, then at Lombard Street. Inside the tower a massive oak gateway is preserved; it had been placed at the Lombard Street entrance to the old church after the Great Fire of London, and is decorated with skulls and crossbones.\nMuch of the church's carved woodwork resembles and is contemporary with the work of Grinling Gibbons, showing traces of his style. The great reredos is the best candidate for his work similar to his work at St Mary Abchurch. Its dimensions were included in Wren's plans, its carving original 17th-century work. The paintings are from its renovation in 1870. At the centre of the reredos is a carved, gilded pelican feeding her young from her own flesh (a traditional image of Christ who feeds his followers with himself in Communion). The main altar comes from the former local mission. The one from Lombard Street is in the Chapel at the south end of the narthex). Behind the choir stalls, which flank the chancel, are two wrought-iron sword rests for the ceremonial sword of the Lord Mayor of London. The wooden, carved, chalice-shaped pulpit with large sounding board comes from Lombard Street. The most famous regular preacher to have occupied it was John Wesley, who is recorded as preaching from it on 28 December 1789, and it is known to be where he preached his first ex tempore (off the cuff) sermon. The pews date from 1870. The baptismal font at the west doors comes from St Benet Gracechurch. Its marble base is decorated with carvings of cherubs, and its tall wooden cover is topped by the figure of Charity welcoming children. The church has an organ built by Renatus Harris in 1695, which is installed in the western gallery per Wren's plans for it, never before realised. Beneath are old churchwardens' box pews emblazoned with a lion/unicorn  (the royal arms supporters).\n\n\n== Activities ==\nServices are held every Sunday at 8.30 (Book of Common Prayer), at 10.00 parish communion and at 11.30 (especially for families with small children).  Services are occasionally held on Sunday evenings at 18.30 (evensong).  Daily prayers are said morning and evening and there is a said Eucharist every Wednesday at 9.30.\nThe 1960s hall is used by the local community including Little Wrens Nursery School.\n\n\n== Car park ==\nThe car park has tens of spaces and is charged per space for Twickenham Rugby Stadium matches/events for maintenance-only funds.\n\n\n== Charitable status ==\nThe Parochial Church Council of All Hallows is registered as a charity with the Charity Commission.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAll Hallows Lombard Street\n\n\n== References =="

It incorporates the fountain of 1689-90 by Edward Pearce the Younger from the Privy Garden, Hampton Court which in turn incorporated bronze figures by Hubert le Sueur from a fountain designed c 1633 by Inigo Jones for the river garden at Somerset House. The Great Basin is not included in the Grade I listing. MATERIALS: carved white marble pedestal on Portland stone podium, bronze figures and basins, gilt bronze figure of Arethusa. The Arethusa or Diana Fountain stands in the centre of the Great Basin, at the confluence of the diverging avenues in Bushy Park, on the axis of the main entrance to the Park, to the north of Hampton Court Palace. The fountain is crowned by a gilt bronze figure of Arethusa standing on a white marble pedestal, which has eight groups of bronze figures around its base. It is raised on a Portland stone podium, set out in eight projecting square piers carved with deep, rusticated banding. The marble pedestal, designed and executed by Edward Pearce in 1689-90 for the Privy Garden at Hampton Court Palace, was moved to its present position on a new, purpose-built podium in 1712-13. Square on plan, with concave sides and carved with swags of sea shells and sea creatures, the pedestal has large, sloping scrolls on the angles, on which are seated bronze boys holding fish, while mermaids astride sea monsters are placed against the sides of the pedestal. Both groups discharge water into four bronze basins set beneath the mermaids at the level of the plinth of the marble pedestal. The bronze figures are the work of the French sculptor Hubert Le Sueur and came from an Arethusa fountain designed by Inigo Jones for Somerset House in 1633-7 which was moved to Hampton Court in 1656. The basins were recast for Pearce's fountain in 1690 and the boys holding fish were recast in 1712. The crowning figure of Arethusa and the mermaids astride dolphins appear to have survived intact from Jones's fountain. In plan, the podium continues downwards the projecting piers and angles in the sub-structure of Pearce's pedestal. The piers are enriched with bands of  'rustication' carved in stalactite formations. The podium is ornamented with four bands of 'grotto-work' rustication carved with naturalistic stalactites in high relief. Large scrolled consoles, carved with leaves and stalactites, support square fluted blocks beneath a continuous central rusticated sill band, while a similar sill band forms a ledge beneath the marble pedestal.HISTORY: the Arethusa or 'Diana' fountain in the centre of the Great Basin of Bushy Park at Hampton Court is a composite structure of three periods. The lower podium, of tall rusticated piers, was constructed in 1712-13 to carry a white marble and bronze fountain designed and carved by sculptor and master mason Edward Pearce the younger (c1635-1695) in 1689-90 for a much smaller basin in the centre of the Privy Garden of Hampton Court Palace. The Privy Garden fountain in turn incorporated bronze sculpture, executed by the French sculptor Hubert Le Sueur (c1580-1658), from a fountain designed by architect and designer Inigo Jones (1573-1652) c1633 for the river garden at Somerset House. Jones's fountain was completed in 1637. It is known from a sketch proposal in his hand of c 1633, a topographical painting by Cornelius Bol, and an anonymous drawing from the 1670s, which indicates that the bronze figures in the lower parts closely followed the original design. The crowning figure of Arethusa was changed in execution to a Diana-like figure clothed in an antique-style dress, gathered at the waist. She has none of the usual attributes of Diana - bow and arrows, crescent moon and hunting dog - and her identity as Arethusa, a nereid or sea nymph who attempted to flee the river god Alpheus and later became a fountain, is confirmed by a description in a Parliamentary inventory of 1659, soon after the fountain was moved to Hampton Court. This describes the bronze sculpture as 'Fo[u]r scollop basins', 'Fo[u]r Sea-Monsters', 'Three Scrowles', 'Fo[u]r boyes holding Dolphins' and 'One large brasse Statue on the top of the Fountaine called Arethusa'. A description in 1663 by a French visitor, M. de la MoliÃ¨re, confirms that the arrangement of figures in the executed fountain followed those in Jones's design. The fountain was 'composed of four syrens in bronze, seated astride dolphins, between which was a shell, supported on the foot of a goat.  Above the sirens, on a second tier, were four little children, each seated, holding a fish, and surmounting all a large figure of a lady - all the figures being bronze, but the fountain itself and the basin of marble'.  The mermaids or 'sirens' in this description were of particular interest to the artist of the 1670s sketch. His rendition of these delicately modelled sea creatures corresponds exactly with their appearance today. As there is no documentary evidence for the recasting of these figures, there seems no reason to assume that these bronze mermaids and sea monsters are not the originals from Jones's Arethusa fountain. In 1689-90 Edward Pearce the younger, sculptor, master mason and decorative carver, redesigned the fountain for the circular basin in the middle of the new Privy Garden. Pearce (c1635-95) was one of the leading master masons of the later C17, working with Wren at St Paul's Cathedral. Pearce's fountain is recorded by Sutton Nichols in a perspective view of the Privy Garden in about 1699. Pearce rearranged the bronze figures around the base of a new white marble pedestal, carved with festoons of shells and sea creatures. The fish-bearing putti were moved down to the same level as the mermaids, and the basins - recast by Josias Iback - were set lower still to catch the water from the spouting figures above. Pearce's fountain was put in store when the southern end of the Privy Garden was reconfigured in 1700-01.  In 1712 an unidentified sculptor or architect working under Sir Christopher Wren designed the tall rusticated stone podium on which Pearce's fountain now stands. In plan, this podium continues downwards the projecting piers and angles in the sub-structure of Pearce's pedestal.  Le Sueur's bronze figures of boys with fish were recast but there is no record of the recasting of the figure of Arethusa and the mermaids sitting astride sea monsters. The new fountain was placed in the middle of a 400-feet diameter basin, dug in 1699 under the supervision of the royal gardener, Henry Wise, as part of extensive new planting and landscaping to create northern approach to the palace across Bushy Park. As royal gardener, Wise was closely involved in setting out major and influential landscapes in the late C17 and early C18, reflecting the latest ideas from France and the Low Countries but establishing an English tradition which was admired and emulated. Inigo Jones (1573-1652) was one of the leading and most influential designers of the period; his impact was expressed across a broad spectrum of work , from buildings such as the Banqueting House, Whitehall (1619-22, listed Grade I), to smaller scale monuments and in theatre design. Le Sueur's work in England reflects French influence on the royal court and on taste, but his sculpture is more commonly found in internal monuments, for example, in Westminster Abbey. His bronze equestrian figure of Charles I, the first of its kind in England, was cast in 1629-33. It too was set up in its present position, on the plinth carved by Joshua Marshall, at the head of Whitehall, at a later date, in 1675, when the political climate was more favourable.

    "wikipediaText": "The Diana Fountain in Bushy Park, in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, England, is a seventeenth-century statue ensemble and water feature in an eighteenth-century setting with a surrounding pool and mile long tree lined vistas which honors the Roman Goddess Diana. Originally created for Somerset House in the 1630s, and remodelled about 1690, the fountain has stood since 1713 in Bushy Park, and now forms a large traffic island in Chestnut Avenue.\nIt is the focal point of two major vistas designed by Sir Christopher Wren, including Chestnut Avenue which is the ceremonial landward approach to Hampton Court Palace. The traffic island is circular and contains a 400-foot (120 m)  diameter pool surrounded by lawns, with the Diana statue on a tall base in the middle of the pool. The fountain was listed as Grade II in 1952 and in 2011 reclassified as Grade I.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe bronze sculptures were originally commissioned by Charles I for Queen Henrietta Maria's garden at Somerset House in central London.  The original design for the fountain was apparently by Inigo Jones, whose sketch drawing survives at Chatsworth House, showing figures recognisably the same as those in place today, but in a different arrangement and in a different stonework setting.  The Somerset House base was lower, and the surrounding pool much smaller, enabling a much closer view of the figures than is possible today.  The central figure is naked in the drawing, and parts of the design are closely copied from engravings of earlier fountains in Bologna and Augsburg.\nThe execution of the gilt statue which forms the pinnacle of the tableaux has been attributed to Hubert Le Sueur, and related to payments to him from the king. The other metal sculptures, which are still ungilded, have been attributed to his rival Francesco Fanelli, and also to Le Sueur; a mention by John Evelyn in 1662 gave the whole fountain to Fanelli, but most historians follow the Royal Parks in preferring the documented involvement of Le Sueur.  Preparation of the site had begun in 1633â34, and Le Sueur was given what appears to be his final payment after completion in 1637; Nicholas Stone was also paid for work on the stone elements, which were in black marble.  In the original arrangement, recorded in a drawing of perhaps the 1670s, the figures of the boys, now on the corners, were higher up, at a level between the central female figure above and the sea-monsters carrying women below, and the scallop shells were on the corners, level with the breasts of the four female figures, catching water spouting from the fish held by the boys.\nDuring the English Commonwealth Oliver Cromwell had the fountain relocated to the privy garden at Hampton Court Palace, where this and other such works were not popular with all his supporters; he was urged by a Mrs Nethaway to \"Demolish these monsters that are set up as ornaments\".  It is in an inventory of 1659 that the central figure is first called \"Arethusa\".  After 1689 William III and Mary II commissioned Sir Christopher Wren to rebuild and expand much of Hampton Court Palace, and this eventually included the creation of Chestnut Avenue with its centrepiece the Diana Fountain as the grand approach to the Palace crossing Bushy Park. Wren, supervising William Talman, completed this part of the project in 1713 during the reign of Queen Anne. The top, scrolled part of the current base, and so the current rearrangement of the figures, is by Edward Pierce, in about 1690, when the sculptures were still in the privy garden, although the fountain was removed from there and put in storage in 1701.  The lower rusticated part, \"disproportionately tall\", was erected for the new site in Bushy Park, and the central figure was gilded, apparently for the first time, for its re-erection.\nThe female figure on top of the fountain \"has over her long life been known as Diana,  Arethusa, Venus and even Proserpina\", and recently \"some younger visitors\" take her for Diana, Princess of Wales.  The official view is now firmly that she represents Arethusa, although the fountain continues to be known as the \"Diana Fountain\", and dissident views are still held by some parties.\nCharles I had the Longford River dug from the River Colne to Hampton Court Palace in order to power the palace water features,\n and in 1713 Sir Christopher Wren utilised this water to give the complex a set of gravity fed water spouts. In the 297 years after the statue was relocated to its current site in the park, many of the waterspouts became clogged and only four were functioning before the renovations of 2009/10.\nDuring World War II the pool was drained and part of Chestnut Avenue was used for Camp Griffiss, the first headquarters of SHAEF and the base where D-Day was planned. The base closed in the 1950s and Chestnut Avenue was subsequently restored.  The complex was renovated in 2010 and the main statue was re-gilded.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Vistas ==\nThe Diana Fountain is at the junction of two long straight tree lined avenues, Lime Avenue and Chestnut Avenue which cross at right angles. The Junction is off centre to both Avenues.  \n\nChestnut Avenue\nChestnut Avenue crosses Bushy Park from Teddington to Hampton Court Palace and contains a road with wide lawns on both sides. There are multiple rows of horse chestnut trees on both sides of Chestnut Avenue.\nChestnut Avenue was created as the ceremonial approach to Hampton Court Palace and to this day still contains a road across the Park, though for the sake of the deer, motor vehicles are only allowed on it during daylight hours. It was part of the route for the men's road race cycling event at the 2012 Summer Olympics.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nLime Avenue\nLime Avenue is grassed and has multiple rows of lime trees on both sides of it; the longer of its two sections runs between The Diana Fountain and White Lodge.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of public art in Richmond upon Thames\n\n\n== References ==\n Diana and Arethusa https://www.theitalianacademy.com/portfolio-posts/myth-arethusa-alpheus/\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nFisher, Geoffrey and Newman, John.  jstor \"A fountain design by Inigo Jones\", The Burlington Magazine, Vol. 127, No. 989 (Aug. 1985), pp. 530â533, retrieved 12 June 2010\nHarris, John.

    "wikipediaText": "St Lawrence Church is the Church of England parish church for Morden in the London Borough of Merton. The building is Grade I listed, and located on London Road, at the highest point of Morden, overlooking Morden Park.\nMorden Parish consists of four churches in total, the other three are Emmanuel (Stonecot Hill), St Martin's (Lower Morden) and St George's (Central Road, Morden).\n\n\n== Building ==\n\n\n=== History ===\n\nSt Lawrence Church was built in 1636.  It is probable that it replaced an earlier building. The nearby Merton Abbey was closed by Henry VIII as part of the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the estate sold. Edward Whitchurch and Lionel Dutchet purchased it, but left for Europe when Queen Mary came to the throne.  The site then came into the ownership of the Garth family.\n\n\n=== Exterior ===\nThe building is designed in Gothic style and features stone dressings and a red tiled, steeply pitched roof. The exterior is mainly of red brick. The church features an aisleless, 4-bay nave which has pointed, two-light windows.  The nave continues into the short chancel.  There is a square, 3 stage west tower and a projecting south west porch with a pointed arched and moulded doorway, later restored in 1887.  The north vestry was added in 1805. There is a 'Y' tracery, cusped four-light east window with later perpendicular tracery.\n\n\n=== Interior ===\nThe interior walls of St Lawrence are plastered and whitewashed.  There are exposed tie beams and king posts under the circular shaped roof.  The west gallery was added in 1792. There is an original stained and painted glass window to the east which features a design of Moses and Aaron, and various wall monuments. The interior features an inlaid timber pulpit, which originates from 1720 and has sounding-board over it for amplification. The tower houses three bells which, owing to restrictions placed by Historic England in order to preserve the frame, can only be tolled.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nThere are services every Sunday at 9:00am, 10:30am, and 6:30pm. The 10:30am service has children's activities - the children join in the first part of the service before leaving for Sunday Club.\n\n\n== Leadership and staff ==\nRevd David Heath-Whyte - Team Rector\nThe Rt Revd Precious Omuku â honorary curate. Omuku is an assistant bishop in the Diocese of Southwark, having been consecrated bishop in South Sudan on 3 January 2016.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSt Lawrence Church\nTeam Parish of Morden"

    "wikipediaText": "St Mary Magdalene's Church, East Ham is a parish church in East Ham, east London, dedicated to St Mary Magdalene. Its nave, chancel and apse date to the first half of the 12th century and the tower probably to the early 13th century but partly rebuilt in the 16th century - it is claimed to be the oldest parish church still in weekly use in Greater London and is listed at Grade I.\nA recess containing a piscina was cut into the nave's south wall beside the chancel for a nave altar in the 13th century, faint traces of wall paintings from that century also survive on the apse. The roofs were altered in the early 17th century and in 1639 Sir Richard Heigham gave the present white marble font. A 17th century memorial to an Edmond Nevill also survived - he is said to have lived locally at Green Street House and he laid claim to the attainted title of Earl of Westmoreland - and to his daughter, Lady Katherine Nevill. Other monuments to Giles Breame and William Heigham survive, whilst William Stukeley is said to have selected the church's churchyard in his lifetime - he is buried there without a monument.\nThough box pews and a triple decker pulpit were added (only to be replaced in the 1890s), the 18th century otherwise saw few alterations. A west gallery for children was added in 1820 and the south porch converted into a vestry ten years later, replaced by a yellow-brick west porch opening into the tower. In 1883 it opened the mission church that became St Michael and All Angels Church, Beckton Road. In 1896 the west gallery was removed and further restorations completed. In 1908 the south porch stopped being a vestry after a new level was created in the tower for a vestry. A complete restoration in 1931 removed the apse and chancel ceilings, opened out the rood-loft stair and stripped the external plaster from the tower.\nThe London Blitz destroyed the chancel roof and the whole church's stained glass in 1941, along with other damage, but repairs were immediate and a permanent restoration of the nave was complete by the war's end, followed by a more comprehensive restorations in 1950 and 1965â1966. It now forms part of the East Ham Team Parish (also known as the Parish of the Holy Trinity) alongside St Edmund's, St Bartholomew's and St Alban's.\n\n\n== References =="

    "wikipediaText": "The House Mill  is a major Grade I listed building on the River Lea in Mill Meads,  and part of the Three Mills complex. The original tidal mills at this site date back to the Domesday book of 1086, and the present structure of the House Mill was built in 1776 by Daniel Bisson. It was damaged by fire in 1802, and then rebuilt by Philip Metcalfe.\nIt is one of only four Grade I listed buildings in the London Borough of Newham. The House Mill remains the \"largest tidal mill standing in Britain\", although the water wheels are not in operation.\nThe south facade of the House Mill displays a coat of arms dated 1776 and the initials \"D S B\" (which could be Daniel and Sarah Bisson), with forty cast iron wall plates which tie the ends of the floor beams.\nThe Miller's House was rebuilt in 1995 with a modern interior, but retaining the original facade. The Miller's House and a house on the other side of the House Mill were originally built for the Miller and his family. A Second World War bomb landed on a nearby bonded warehouse and damaged both houses on 15 October 1940 which were later demolished. The Mill stopped operating and was used as a warehouse.\n\n\n== Publications ==\n\nThe following are research papers published by the House Mill (River Lea Tidal Mill Trust Ltd).\n\nThe Three Mills Distillery in the Georgian era by  Keith Fairclough (2003) ISBN 0-9544094-4-2\nThe LeFevre family and distilling along the Lower Lea by  Keith Fairclough (2003) ISBN 0-9544094-5-0\nOwners of the Three Mills (1539â1728) by Keith Fairclough (2003) ISBN 0-9544094-3-4\nPhilip Metcalfe (1733â1818), the MP and industrialist who built the Clock Mill by Keith Fairclough (2003) ISBN 0-9544094-7-7\nThe Bisson Family of Three Mills by Keith Fairclough and Brian Strong (2003) ISBN 0-9544094-6-9\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nHouse Mill website"

    "wikipediaText": "St Mary the Virgin, Wanstead is a Church of England church in Wanstead, east London. It is located on Overton Drive and now shares its parish with Christ Church, Wanstead. It is the only Grade I listed building in the London Borough of Redbridge.\nThe parish is first recorded in 1208, but its medieval church was replaced 70 foot to the north by the present building between 1787 and 1790, on a plot donated from his estate by James Tylney-Long. It was designed by architect Thomas Hardwick. Its foundation stone was laid on 13 July 1787, followed by a reception at Wanstead House, and it was completed on 24 June 1790, with a consecration ceremony led by Beilby Porteus, bishop of London. After the new church was completed, its medieval predecessor was demolished, though the latter's large monument to Josiah Child was moved to the new church.\nThe sculptor Joseph Wilton and the Royal Navy Vice-Admiral Robert Plampin are buried in the churchyard.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial parish website"

    "wikipediaText": "Holy Trinity Church, Dartford, is a parish church affiliated with the Church of England in Dartford, Kent. It is a Grade I listed building dating from the 11th century.\n\n\n== History ==\n \nLocated on Dartford High Street next to the River Darent, the oldest part of the church was constructed in approximately 1080 by Gundulf, Bishop of Rochester, on the site of an earlier Saxon building, and was mentioned in the Domesday Book as containing three chapels. It was enlarged in the 13th century with the addition of a new chapel dedicated to Saint Thomas Becket, for use by pilgrims. When that chapel's altar was removed during the English Reformation and the flow of pilgrims dried up, the church ceased to provide a focus for the town's religious and ceremonial life, and many traders lost a valuable source of income.\nIn about 1485, a fresco depicting Saint George slaying the dragon was painted on one of the church's walls and can still be seen today.\n\n \nThe original Norman tower (currently containing eight bells) was added onto in the 14th century, and part of the church was removed during alterations by Robert Mylne in 1792 in order to widen the High Street. Further restoration work was completed in the 1860s and 1870s by Arthur Blomfield (whose brother-in-law was a vicar of the church) and in 1910 by W. D. CarÃ¶e.\nThe church became a Grade I listed building in 1953. It contains a number of brass and stone monuments, including a tablet by the mason William Stanton in memory of John Twisleton and another in memory of the engineer and inventor Richard Trevithick. Other memorials have been erected for the papermaker and jeweller Sir John Spilman and the topographer John Dunkin. The parents of the musician Mick Jagger were married at Holy Trinity Church in 1940.\nA small portion of the original churchyard survives east of the church, a parish hall having been constructed on the northern part in 1971. A new churchyard was created on the site of the chantry chapel of St Edmund the Martyr.\n\n\n== Present day ==\n \nRooted in the liberal Anglo-Catholic tradition of the Church of England, Holy Trinity offers weekly services sung by a choir.\nHoly Trinity Church of England Primary School is affiliated with the church.\n\n\n== Vicars of Dartford ==\nThe list of Vicars can be traced back to the 13th century. The following have served since the time of the Glorious Revolution:\n\n\n== References =="

    "wikipediaText": "The Main Building of University College London, facing onto Gower Street, Bloomsbury, includes the Octagon, Quad, Cloisters, Main Library, Flaxman Gallery and the Wilkins Building. The North Wing, South Wing, Chadwick Building and Pearson Building are also considered part of the main UCL building.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1827, a year after the founding of UCL, construction of the main building began on the site of the old Carmarthen Square. The Octagon Building is a term used for the whole of the main building, but more commonly for a central part of it. At the centrepiece of the building is an ornate dome, which is visible throughout the immediate area. The Octagon was designed by the Architect William Wilkins, who also designed the National Gallery. The original plans by Wilkins called for a U-shaped enclosure around the quad. Funds, however, ran out in 1829 with only the portico and dome finished. Wilkins' original plans were not completed until the 20th century: The Main Building was finally finished in 1985, 158 years since the foundations were laid, with a formal opening ceremony by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== Octagon ==\nThe Wilkins Building is a term used for the whole of the Main Building, but more commonly for a central part of it. The Octagon dome houses the central hall of the University Main Library, which contains casts from the John Flaxman casts collection, and a mural depicting the construction of UCL in a mythical scene with Jeremy Bentham overlooking the plans.\n\n\n== Front Quad ==\nFacing Gower Street, the Front Quadrangle, abbreviated as the \"Quad\", is an enclosed square of paths, grass and a few disabled car parking bays. There are a large number of benches as well as two decommissioned astronomy observatories.\n\n\n== Cloisters ==\nThe enclosed north and south cloisters connect the Octagon dome to the north and south wings of the quad respectively.  They are one of the main thoroughfares of the College, and accommodate a series of exhibitions and events throughout the year (for example shows from students of the Slade School of Art and from the UCL special collections).  To the north of the north cloisters is the Housman Room, which is a staff common room.  The auto-icon of Jeremy Bentham was located in the south of the south cloisters up until February 2020 when he was permanently relocated to the public atrium of the Student Centre.\n\n\n== Wilkins Building ==\nThe Wilkins Building refers specifically to the part of the building built during the lifetime of the architect William Wilkins. It does not include the later, U-shaped extensions around the Quad. Although these were designed by Wilkins they were not finished until 1985. Therefore the Wilkins Building refers to the oldest sections of the Main Building: the centre part of the main building which includes the UCL Main Library, the dome, the Flaxman Gallery and the Cloisters.  The Wilkins Building (along with the south wing built in 1869â76, the north wing built in 1870â81 and parts of the west side built over 1912â52) is grade I listed; the two observatories in the quad are grade II listed.\n\n\n== Main Library ==\n\nThe Main Library contains UCL's collections relating to arts and humanities, history, economics, public policy and law. The Flaxman Gallery, a collection of sculptures and paintings by artist John Flaxman, is located inside the Main Library in the Octagon Building under UCL's central dome.\n\n\n== References =="

    "wikipediaText": "Burgh House is a historic house located on New End Square in Hampstead, London, that includes the Hampstead Museum.  The house is also listed as Burgh House & Hampstead Museum.\n\n\n== Brief history ==\nBurgh House was constructed in 1704 during the reign of Queen Anne. At the time of construction the Hampstead Wells Spa was flourishing. In 1720 the Spa's physician, Dr. William Gibbons, moved to Burgh House, which he enlarged.  He added the present wrought-iron gate which carries his initials.\nOne inhabitant of the house was Israel Lewis, who was an upholsterer.  He was involved in a court case in which he was found guilty of creating a nuisance by \"making an inclosed Dung stall\" in his garden, and was fined Â£5 and made to remove it. Until the 1870s the house was known as Lewis House.\nIn 1858 Burgh House was taken over by the Royal East Middlesex Militia, and served as the headquarters and officers' mess until 1881. The house returned to domestic use in 1884.\nFrom 1906â24 the house was occupied by Dr. George Williamson, an international art expert. He commissioned Gertrude Jekyll to design the garden, although only the terrace now remains.\nIn 1925, a director of Lloyds Bank, Captain Constantine Evelyn Benson CBE, DSO, bought the house for Â£4,750. He built the present music room on the site of Dr. Williamson's library.\nBetween 1933â37, Rudyard Kipling's daughter, Elsie Bambridge lived in Burgh House with her husband, Captain George Bambridge. Rudyard Kipling's last outing in 1936 was to Burgh House, to visit his daughter.\nFrom 1937â46 Burgh House was unoccupied. It was bought and restored by Hampstead Borough Council in 1946. The barrack blocks in front of the building were pulled down and in 1947 it reopened as a community centre with a Citizen's Advice Bureau in its basement.\nThe house was again closed indefinitely in 1977 when its new owners, Camden Council, discovered dry rot in the building. Threatened with proposals to turn the house over to a commercial use, local residents formed a charitable trust and launched a \"Keep Burgh House\" appeal, as a result of which Camden Council granted them a lease for the house. On 8 September 1979, the house, restored by the council and refurbished by the trust, opened to the public as the house and museum that it is today.\n\n\n== Hampstead Museum ==\nIn recent years it has been further restored with backing from The Heritage Lottery Fund, Bridge House Trust and many local benefactors.  The refurbished building opened to the public on 16 July 2006. Burgh House has the world's largest archive and collection of Helen Allingham's  work.  \nThe first floor houses the Hampstead Museum, with permanent exhibits on local history and culture. There are also first floor and ground galleries for temporary exhibits of art, local history and culture. A cafe occupies the basement, with outside seating in the gardens.\nBurgh House currently hosts exhibitions and concerts, and is hired for weddings, receptions and other private events.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website"

    "wikipediaText": "Lambeth Palace is the official London residence of the Archbishop of Canterbury. It is situated in north Lambeth, London, on the south bank of the River Thames, 400 yards (370 metres) south-east of the Palace of Westminster, which houses Parliament, on the opposite bank.\nClose to Westminster and the City, the estate was first acquired by the archdiocese for the archbishop (who also has a residence at Old Palace, Canterbury) around 1200.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nWhile the original residence of the archbishop of Canterbury was in his episcopal see, Canterbury, Kent, a site originally called the Manor of Lambeth or Lambeth House was acquired by the diocese around AD 1200 (though Archbishop Anselm had a house there a century earlier) and has since served as the archbishop's London residence. The site was chosen for its convenient proximity to the royal palace and government seat of Westminster, just across the Thames. The site is bounded by Lambeth Palace Road to the west and Lambeth Road to the south, but unlike all surrounding land is excluded from the parish of North Lambeth. The garden park is listed and resembles Archbishop's Park, a neighbouring public park; however, it was a larger area with a notable orchard until the early 19th century. The former church in front of its entrance has been converted to the Garden Museum.  The south bank of the Thames along this reach, not part of historic London, developed slowly because the land was low and sodden: it was called Lambeth Marsh, as far downriver as the present Blackfriars Road. The name \"Lambeth\" embodies \"hithe\", a landing on the river: archbishops came and went by water, as did John Wycliff, who was tried here for heresy in 1378. In the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, the palace was attacked. Cardinal Pole lay in state in the palace for 40 days after he died there in 1558. \nThe palace was again attacked in May 1640 during a period of popular discontent with the Arminianist theology of the Archbishop, William Laud, in the hope of capturing him. The palace was ransacked and partially demolished by the Parliamentarians in the English Civil War of the 1640s, necessitating major reconstruction, especially of the great hall, in 1660-63. \nNew construction was added to the building in 1829â1834 by Edward Blore (1787â1879), who rebuilt much of Buckingham Palace later, in neo-Gothic style and it fronts a spacious quadrangle. Blore's large extensions to house the archbishop meant that the original buildings could be converted to the archdiocese's library, record office and secretariat. The palace was damaged in the Blitz of 1941. The buildings form the home of the archbishop, who is regarded as the first among equals in the Anglican Communion, and is ex officio a member of the House of Lords.\n\n\n== Buildings ==\nThe building is listed in the highest category, Grade I, for its architecture. The palace consists of two main structures: the residence itself, which is built round a cloister, and Morton's Tower, which forms the main entry.  The medieval building had three more courtyards, which have since disappeared, as has the moat that surrounded the complex. The unusual inclusion of a cloister may be because Archbishop Hubert Walter initially intended to found a Premonstratensian abbey on the site, before settling on a palace. The original timber cloister, which held the archbishop's library, was replaced by the present structure in 1830. The oldest remaining part of the palace is the 13th century chapel which was built in the Early English Gothic architectural style. It stands above a vaulted undercroft, which has a central line of columns. This part had to be heavily restored after the Blitz, so most of its fittings are of 1954-55. The medieval great hall, now gone, appears to have been rebuilt following damage in the Peasants' Revolt. The south end of the hall joined the kitchen and offices, while a stair at the north end led to the archbishop's apartments. One 14th century room of these apartments, now known as the Guard Chamber, still stands, with its original elaborate roof. Further private accommodation was added when the Water or Lollards' Tower, built of Kentish Ragstone with ashlar quoins, was built at the north-west corner in 1434-35. It was extended and heightened later in the century, and again in the early 16th century when Laud's Tower was built next to it. At the top of the stair was the Archbishop's prison, a room also seen at Winchester Palace in Southwark. The massive five-storey brick gatehouse was built by Cardinal John Morton and completed in 1495 and housed eight lodgings for the Archbishop's household. Improvements continued into the 16th century, when Archbishop Cranmer built a brick tower north-east of the chapel to house his study.\nThe most serious damage done by the Cromwellians in the late 1640s was the demolition of the great hall and the sale of its materials. After the Restoration, it was completely rebuilt by Archbishop William Juxon in 1663 (dated) with a late Gothic hammerbeam roof.  The choice of a hammerbeam roof was evocative, as it reflected the High-Church Anglican continuity with the Old Faith (the King's (Charles II) brother was an avowed Catholic) and served as a visual statement that the Interregnum was over. As with some Gothic details on University buildings of the same date, it is debated among architectural historians whether this is \"Gothic survival\" or an early work of the \"Gothic Revival\". The diarist Samuel Pepys recognised it as \"a new old-fashioned hall\". Major work was done by Blore in 1829-33, with large parts of the medieval palace being rebuilt, and an extensive new wing in Gothic revival style added.\nAmong the portraits of the archbishops in the palace are works by Hans Holbein, Anthony van Dyck, William Hogarth and Sir Joshua Reynolds.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Gardens ==\n\nThe fig tree in the palace courtyard is possibly grown from a slip taken from one of the White Marseille fig trees here for centuries (reputedly planted by Cardinal Pole). In 1786, there were three ancient figs, two \"nailed against the wall\" and still noted in 1826 as \"two uncommonly fine... traditionally reported to have been planted by Cardinal Pole, and fixed against that part of the palace believed to have been founded by him. They are of the white Marseilles sort, and still bear delicious fruit. ...On the south side of the building, in a small private garden, is another tree of the same kind and age.\" By 1882, their place had been taken by several massive offshoots. The notable orchard of the medieval period has somewhat given way to a mirroring public park adjoining and built-up roads of housing and offices. The palace gardens were listed grade II in October 1987.\n\n\n== Library ==\n\nWithin the palace precincts is Lambeth Palace Library, the official library of the archbishop of Canterbury, and the principal repository of records of the Church of England. It describes itself as \"the largest religious collection outside of the Vatican\".\nThe library was founded as a public library by Archbishop Richard Bancroft in 1610, and was historically located within the main Palace complex. A new purpose-built library and repository opened in 2021. This is located at the far end of the Palace gardens, with its entrance on Lambeth Palace Road, and was designed by Wright & Wright. In addition to the existing library collections, it houses the archival collections of various Church of England institutions formerly held at the Church of England Record Centre (opened 1989) in Bermondsey.\nThe library contains an extensive collection of material relating to ecclesiastical history, including the archives of the archbishops dating back to the 12th century, and those of other church bodies and of various Anglican missionary and charitable societies. Manuscripts include items dating back to the 9th century. The library also holds over 120,000 printed books. In 1996, when Sion College Library closed, Lambeth Palace Library acquired its important holdings of manuscripts, pamphlets, and pre-1850 printed books.\nTopics covered by the collections range from the history of art and architecture to colonial and Commonwealth history, and numerous aspects of English social, political and economic history. The library is also an important resource for local history and genealogy. For online catalogues, see External links below.\n\n\n=== Highlights of the collection ===\n\nNotable items in the collections include:\n\nMac Durnan Gospels (late 9th/early 10th centuries)\nMinuscule 473 (11th century)\nMinuscule 559 (11th century)\nLambeth Apocalypse (12th century)\nThe Romanesque Lambeth Bible (12th century)\nLambeth Homilies (c.â1200)\nBook of Hours of King Richard III (mid 15th century)\nA Short English Chronicle (mid 15th century)\nA rare copy of the Gutenberg Bible (1450s)\nLambeth Choirbook (16th century)\nBook of Howth (late 16th century)\nArchives of the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches (1711â1759)\nArchives of the Incorporated Church Building Society (1818â1982)\n\n\n== St Mary-at-Lambeth ==\n\nImmediately outside the gatehouse stands the former parish church of St Mary-at-Lambeth which was preserved by a campaign led by John and Rosemary Nicholson. The tower dates from 1377 (repaired in 1834); while the body of the church was rebuilt in 1851 to the designs of Philip Hardwick. Older monuments were preserved, including the tombs of some of the gardeners and plantsmen John Tradescant the elder and his son of the same name, and of Admiral William Bligh. St Mary's was deconsecrated in 1972, when the parish was absorbed into the surrounding parish of North Lambeth which has three active churches, the nearest being St Anselm's Church, Kennington Cross. The Museum of Garden History (now the Garden Museum) opened in the building in 1977, taking advantage of its Tradescant associations.\nDuring renovation works in 2016, a previously unknown crypt was discovered, containing 30 coffins. Amongst these were those of five archbishops of CanterburyâRichard Bancroft, Thomas Tenison, Matthew Hutton, Frederick Cornwallis, and John Mooreâas well as that of John Bettesworth, Dean of the Arches.\n\n\n== Resident community ==\n\nLambeth Palace is home to the Community of Saint Anselm, an Anglican religious order that is under the patronage of the archbishop of Canterbury.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nOld Palace, Canterbury, within the precincts of Canterbury Cathedral, is the residence of the archbishop when in Canterbury\nList of palaces\nPalace of Whitehall\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nPalmer, Richard; Brown, Michelle P., eds.

By S. S. Teulon. Purple Luton brick with stone dressings, bands and  \n          sculptures. Slated roofs.                                   \n          STYLE: modified Early French Gothic style with plate tracery.\n          PLAN/EXTERIOR: 6-bay aisled nave with clerestory, transepts \n          and apsidal polygonal sanctuary, beneath which a mezzanine  \n          floor of meeting rooms. Tall crossing tower with pyramidal  \n          roof and attached stair turret, with conical roof, on       \n          south-east angle. Gabled west front with portico of three arcaded\n          arches on clustered columns flanked by large stepped        \n          buttresses attached to church by flying buttresses, both with\n          sculptured figures. Below modillion parapet, nine grouped arcaded\n          windows lighting an internal gallery. Above, a plate tracery\n          wheel window. Aisles with lean-to roofs have square-headed  \n          4-light trefoil tracery windows; slightly pointed arch      \n          clerestory windows of four lights and quatrefoil tracery flanked\n          by sculptured demi-angels probably by Thomas Earp. Buttressed\n          gabled transepts with 5-light windows, each having two rose and\n          a wheel window; north transept with gable sculpture of King \n          David by Earp. Buttressed sanctuary with 1 and 2-light windows\n          having trefoil and rose window tracery. Tower has paired    \n          louvred belfry openings, clocks to each face and an arcaded \n          gallery which extends around the stair turret.INTERIOR: not inspected but noted to have been magnificent  \n          when complete, and retaining much of interest in its derelict\n          state. Pale yellow, white and grey banded brick; fine brick \n          vault to crossing, double chancel arch and vaulted sanctuary.\n          Nave roofed in timber by massive trusses of arch-braces, Queen\n          posts and collar purlins. Nave arcading on sandstone columns\n          supporting brick arches enlivened in outline by dogtooth    \n          decoration and projecting headers and stretchers; capitals  \n          carved by Earp. Above, sgraffito roundels. Narthex with brick\n          gallery opening onto nave through three segmental arches supported\n          on coupled columns with curious unhistorical circular       \n          dosserets. Stained glass, much vandalised and some stolen, by\n          Clayton and Bell and Heaton, Butler & Bayne. Vandalised     \n          mosaics by Salviati. Font given by and probably designed by \n          Ewan Christian. Formerly with fine woodwork by Temple Moore,\n          Henry Willis organ and good pulpit; all now removed.        HISTORICAL NOTE: from an original estimate for the building \n          cost of Â£7,500 the final cost rose to Â£27,000; St Stephen's \n          was the climax of Teulon's career and life. John Ruskin was \n          said to have described it as \"the finest specimen of brick  \n          building in all the land\". The church was declared redundant\n          in 1977 but has since reopened.

    "wikipediaText": "St. Stephen's is a former church building in Hampstead, London. It is sited on Rosslyn Hill at its junction with Pond Street, a steep slope adjacent to the Royal Free Hospital, and held up to 1,200 worshippers at its peak.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was designed in the Neo Gothic style by Samuel Sanders Teulon and he considered it the best of the 114 churches he designed, calling it his \"mighty church\" â it was also the most expensive of them. He accepted the commission to design it after Sir Thomas Maryon Wilson, Lord of the Manor of Hampstead, offered Hampstead Green to be the site for a new church in 1864. From 1864 to 1867 funds were raised (the projected cost was estimated as Â£7,500; the final sum was actually Â£27,000). External sculptures are by Thomas Earp. Some mosaics by Salviati have survived in the chancel. \n\nWork began in January 1869, with the foundation stone being laid May that year and consecration by John Jackson the Bishop of London occurring on 31 December. It was fully complete by 1870, but was continually prone to subsidence due to its hilly site.\nThe performer and composer Marie Lloyd Jr. married here in 1907, while the Christian suffragist, writer and female pioneer Margaret Nevinson was buried here in 1932.\nBy the later 1960s concerns had been raised on structural grounds and, with maintenance costs rising and its congregation declining, it was closed for worship in 1977.\nThe building was made a Grade I listed building in 1974, which saved it from demolition to provide a car park for the hospital and from being converted into residential flats. However, it went into a slow decay, with squatters moving in, while discussions for a new use dragged on.\nIn 1999 a lease on the church was awarded to the St Stephen's Restoration and Preservation Trust, and after this body raised over Â£4 million from English Heritage, the Heritage Lottery Fund, local businesses and individual donors, it was restored to a usable condition in three phases.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSt Stephenâs Restoration & Preservation Trust official site"

    "wikipediaText": "The British Museum is a public museum dedicated to human history, art and culture located in the Bloomsbury area of London. Its permanent collection of eight million works is the largest in the world. It documents the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present. Established in 1753, the British Museum was the first public national museum to cover all fields of knowledge.\nIn 2023, the museum received 5,820,860 visitors, an increase of 42% from 2022. It was the most popular attraction in the United Kingdom according to the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions (ALVA).\nAt its beginning, the museum was largely based on the collections of the Anglo-Irish physician and scientist Sir Hans Sloane. It opened to the public in 1759, in Montagu House, on the site of the current building. The museum's expansion over the following 250 years was largely a result of British colonisation and resulted in the creation of several branch institutions, or independent spin-offs, the first being the Natural History Museum in 1881. Some of its best-known acquisitions, such as the Greek Elgin Marbles and the Egyptian Rosetta Stone, are subject to long-term disputes and repatriation claims.\nIn 1973, the British Library Act 1972 detached the library department from the British Museum, but it continued to host the now separated British Library in the same Reading Room and building as the museum until 1997. The museum is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Like all UK national museums, it charges no admission fee except for loan exhibitions.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Sir Hans Sloane ===\n\nAlthough today principally a museum of cultural art objects and antiquities, the British Museum was founded as a \"universal museum\". Its foundations lie in the will of the Anglo-Irish physician and naturalist Sir Hans Sloane (1660â1753), a London-based doctor and scientist from Ulster. During the course of his lifetime, and particularly after he married the widow of a wealthy Jamaican planter, Sloane gathered a large collection of curiosities, and not wishing to see his collection broken up after death, he bequeathed it to King George II, for the nation, for a sum of Â£20,000.\nAt that time, Sloane's collection consisted of around 71,000 objects of all kinds including some 40,000 printed books, 7,000 manuscripts, extensive natural history specimens including 337 volumes of dried plants, prints and drawings including those by Albrecht DÃ¼rer and antiquities from Sudan, Egypt, Greece, Rome, the Ancient Near and Far East and the Americas.\n\n\n=== Foundation (1753) ===\nOn 7 June 1753, King George II gave his royal assent to the Act of Parliament which established the British Museum. The British Museum Act 1753 also added two other libraries to the Sloane collection, namely the Cottonian Library, assembled by Sir Robert Cotton, dating back to Elizabethan times, and the Harleian Library, the collection of the Earls of Oxford. They were joined in 1757 by the \"Old Royal Library\", now the Royal manuscripts, assembled by various British monarchs. Together these four \"foundation collections\" included many of the most treasured books now in the British Library including the Lindisfarne Gospels and the sole surviving manuscript of Beowulf.\n\nThe British Museum was the first of a new kind of museum â national, belonging to neither church nor king, freely open to the public and aiming to collect everything. Sloane's collection, while including a vast miscellany of objects, tended to reflect his scientific interests. The addition of the Cotton and Harley manuscripts introduced a literary and antiquarian element, and meant that the British Museum now became both National Museum and library.\n\n\n=== Cabinet of curiosities (1753â1778) ===\n\nThe body of trustees decided on a converted 17th-century mansion, Montagu House, as a location for the museum, which it bought from the Montagu family for Â£20,000. The trustees rejected Buckingham House, which was later converted into the present day Buckingham Palace, on the grounds of cost and the unsuitability of its location.\nWith the acquisition of Montagu House, the first exhibition galleries and reading room for scholars opened on 15 January 1759. At this time, the largest parts of collection were the library, which took up the majority of the rooms on the ground floor of Montagu House, and the natural history objects, which took up an entire wing on the second state storey of the building. In 1763, the trustees of the British Museum, under the influence of Peter Collinson and William Watson, employed the former student of Carl Linnaeus, Daniel Solander, to reclassify the natural history collection according to the Linnaean system, thereby making the museum a public centre of learning accessible to the full range of European natural historians. In 1823, King George IV gave the King's Library assembled by George III, and Parliament gave the right to a copy of every book published in the country, thereby ensuring that the museum's library would expand indefinitely. During the few years after its foundation the British Museum received several further gifts, including the Thomason Collection of Civil War Tracts and David Garrick's library of 1,000 printed plays. The predominance of natural history, books and manuscripts began to lessen when in 1772 the museum acquired for Â£8,410 its first significant antiquities in Sir William Hamilton's \"first\" collection of Greek vases.\n\n\n=== Indolence and energy (1778â1800) ===\n\nFrom 1778, a display of objects from the South Seas brought back from the round-the-world voyages of Captain James Cook and the travels of other explorers fascinated visitors with a glimpse of previously unknown lands. The bequest of a collection of books, engraved gems, coins, prints and drawings by Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode in 1800 did much to raise the museum's reputation; but Montagu House became increasingly crowded and decrepit and it was apparent that it would be unable to cope with further expansion.\nThe museum's first notable addition towards its collection of antiquities, since its foundation, was by Sir William Hamilton (1730â1803), British Ambassador to Naples, who sold his collection of Greek and Roman artefacts to the museum in 1784 together with a number of other antiquities and natural history specimens. A list of donations to the museum, dated 31 January 1784, refers to the Hamilton bequest of a \"Colossal Foot of an Apollo in Marble\". It was one of two antiquities of Hamilton's collection drawn for him by Francesco Progenie, a pupil of Pietro Fabris, who also contributed a number of drawings of Mount Vesuvius sent by Hamilton to the Royal Society in London.\n\n\n=== Growth and change (1800â1825) ===\n\nIn the early 19th century the foundations for the extensive collection of sculpture began to be laid and Greek, Roman and Egyptian artefacts dominated the antiquities displays. After the defeat of the French campaign in the Battle of the Nile, in 1801, the British Museum acquired more Egyptian sculptures and in 1802 King George III presented the Rosetta Stone â key to the deciphering of hieroglyphs. Gifts and purchases from Henry Salt, British consul general in Egypt, beginning with the Colossal bust of Ramesses II in 1818, laid the foundations of the collection of Egyptian Monumental Sculpture. Many Greek sculptures followed, notably the first purpose-built exhibition space, the Charles Towneley collection, much of it Roman sculpture, in 1805. In 1806, Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin, ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1799 to 1803 removed the large collection of marble sculptures from the Parthenon, on the Acropolis in Athens and transferred them to the UK. In 1816 these masterpieces of western art were acquired by the British Museum by Act of Parliament and deposited in the museum thereafter. The collections were supplemented by the Bassae frieze from Phigaleia, Greece in 1815. The Ancient Near Eastern collection also had its beginnings in 1825 with the purchase of Assyrian and Babylonian antiquities from Mary Mackintosh Rich, the widow of Assyriologist Claudius James Rich.\nIn 1802 a buildings committee was set up to plan for expansion of the museum, and further highlighted by the donation in 1822 of the King's Library, personal library of King George III's, comprising 65,000 volumes, 19,000 pamphlets, maps, charts and topographical drawings. The neoclassical architect, Sir Robert Smirke, was asked to draw up plans for an eastern extension to the museum \"... for the reception of the Royal Library, and a Picture Gallery over it ...\" and put forward plans for today's quadrangular building, much of which can be seen today. The dilapidated Old Montagu House was demolished and work on the King's Library Gallery began in 1823. The extension, the East Wing, was completed by 1831. However, following the founding of the National Gallery, London in 1824, the proposed Picture Gallery was no longer needed, and the space on the upper floor was given over to the Natural history collections.\nThe first Synopsis of the British Museum was published in 1808. This described the contents of the museum, and the display of objects room by room, and updated editions were published every few years.\n\n\n=== The largest building site in Europe (1825â1850) ===\n\nAs Sir Robert Smirke's grand neo-classical building gradually arose, the museum became a construction site. The King's Library, on the ground floor of the East Wing, was handed over in 1827, and was described as one of the finest rooms in London. Although it was not fully open to the general public until 1857, special openings were arranged during The Great Exhibition of 1851.\nIn 1840, the museum became involved in its first overseas excavations, Charles Fellows's expedition to Xanthos, in Asia Minor, whence came remains of the tombs of the rulers of ancient Lycia, among them the Nereid and Payava monuments. In 1857, Charles Newton was to discover the 4th-century BC Mausoleum of Halikarnassos, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. In the 1840s and 1850s the museum supported excavations in Assyria by A.H. Layard and others at sites such as Nimrud and Nineveh. Of particular interest to curators was the eventual discovery of Ashurbanipal's great library of cuneiform tablets, which helped to make the museum a focus for Assyrian studies.\nSir Thomas Grenville (1755â1846), a trustee of the British Museum from 1830, assembled a library of 20,240 volumes, which he left to the museum in his will. The books arrived in January 1847 in twenty-one horse-drawn vans. The only vacant space for this large library was a room originally intended for manuscripts, between the Front Entrance Hall and the Manuscript Saloon. The books remained here until the British Library moved to St Pancras in 1998.\n\n\n=== Collecting from the wider world (1850â1875) ===\nThe opening of the forecourt in 1852 marked the completion of Robert Smirke's 1823 plan, but already adjustments were having to be made to cope with the unforeseen growth of the collections. Infill galleries were constructed for Assyrian sculptures and Sydney Smirke's Round Reading Room, with space for a million books, opened in 1857. Because of continued pressure on space the decision was taken to move natural history to a new building in South Kensington, which would later become the British Museum of Natural History.\nRoughly contemporary with the construction of the new building was the career of a man sometimes called the \"second founder\" of the British Museum, the Italian librarian Anthony Panizzi. Under his supervision, the British Museum Library (now part of the British Library) quintupled in size and became a well-organised institution worthy of being called a national library, the largest library in the world after the National Library of Paris. The quadrangle at the centre of Smirke's design proved to be a waste of valuable space and was filled at Panizzi's request by a circular Reading Room of cast iron, designed by Smirke's brother, Sydney Smirke.\nUntil the mid-19th century, the museum's collections were relatively circumscribed but, in 1851, with the appointment to the staff of Augustus Wollaston Franks to curate the collections, the museum began for the first time to collect British and European medieval antiquities, prehistory, branching out into Asia and diversifying its holdings of ethnography. A real coup for the museum was the purchase in 1867, over French objections, of the Duke of Blacas's wide-ranging and valuable collection of antiquities. Overseas excavations continued and John Turtle Wood discovered the remains of the 4th century BC Temple of Artemis at Ephesos, another Wonder of the Ancient World.\n\n\n=== Scholarship and legacies (1875â1900) ===\nThe natural history collections were an integral part of the British Museum until their removal to the new British Museum of Natural History in 1887, nowadays the Natural History Museum in South Kensington. With the departure and the completion of the new White Wing (fronting Montague Street) in 1884, more space was available for antiquities and ethnography and the library could further expand. This was a time of innovation as electric lighting was introduced in the Reading Room and exhibition galleries.\nThe William Burges collection of armoury was bequeathed to the museum in 1881. In 1882, the museum was involved in the establishment of the independent Egypt Exploration Fund (now Society) the first British body to carry out research in Egypt. A bequest from Miss Emma Turner in 1892 financed excavations in Cyprus. In 1897 the death of the great collector and curator, A. W. Franks, was followed by an immense bequest of 3,300 finger rings, 153 drinking vessels, 512 pieces of continental porcelain, 1,500 netsuke, 850 inro, over 30,000 bookplates and miscellaneous items of jewellery and plate, among them the Oxus Treasure.\nIn 1898 Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild bequeathed the Waddesdon Bequest, the glittering contents from his New Smoking Room at Waddesdon Manor. This consisted of almost 300 pieces of objets d'art et de vertu which included exquisite examples of jewellery, plate, enamel, carvings, glass and maiolica, among them the Holy Thorn Reliquary, probably created in the 1390s in Paris for John, Duke of Berry. The collection was in the tradition of a Schatzkammer such as those formed by the Renaissance princes of Europe. Baron Ferdinand's will was most specific, and failure to observe the terms would make it void, the collection should be\n\nplaced in a special room to be called the Waddesdon Bequest Room separate and apart from the other contents of the Museum and thenceforth for ever thereafter, keep the same in such room or in some other room to be substituted for it. These terms are still observed, and the collection occupies room 2a.\n\n\n=== New century, new building (1900â1925) ===\n\nBy the last years of the 19th century, The British Museum's collections had increased to the extent that its building was no longer large enough. In 1895 the trustees purchased the 69 houses surrounding the museum with the intention of demolishing them and building around the west, north and east sides of the museum. The first stage was the construction of the northern wing beginning 1906.\nAll the while, the collections kept growing. Emil Torday collected in Central Africa, Aurel Stein in Central Asia, D. G. Hogarth, Leonard Woolley and T. E. Lawrence excavated at Carchemish. Around this time, the American collector and philanthropist J. Pierpont Morgan donated a substantial number of objects to the museum, including William Greenwell's collection of prehistoric artefacts from across Europe which he had purchased for Â£10,000 in 1908. Morgan had also acquired a major part of Sir John Evans's coin collection, which was later sold to the museum by his son J. P. Morgan Jr. in 1915. In 1918, because of the threat of wartime bombing, some objects were evacuated via the London Post Office Railway to Holborn, the National Library of Wales (Aberystwyth) and a country house near Malvern. On the return of antiquities from wartime storage in 1919 some objects were found to have deteriorated. A conservation laboratory was set up in May 1920 and became a permanent department in 1931. It is today the oldest in continuous existence. In 1923, the British Museum welcomed over one million visitors.\n\n\n=== Disruption and reconstruction (1925â1950) ===\nNew mezzanine floors were constructed and book stacks rebuilt in an attempt to cope with the flood of books. In 1931, the art dealer Sir Joseph Duveen offered funds to build a gallery for the Parthenon sculptures. Designed by the American architect John Russell Pope, it was completed in 1938. The appearance of the exhibition galleries began to change as dark Victorian reds gave way to modern pastel shades.\nFollowing the retirement of George Francis Hill as Director and Principal Librarian in 1936, he was succeeded by John Forsdyke.\nAs tensions with Nazi Germany developed and it appeared that war may be imminent Forsdyke came to the view that with the likelihood of far worse air-raids than that experienced in World War I that the museum had to make preparations to remove its most valuable items to secure locations. Following the Munich crisis Forsdyke ordered 3,300 No-Nail Boxes and stored them in the basement of Duveen Gallery. At the same time he began identifying and securing suitable locations. As a result, the museum was able to quickly commence relocating selected items on 24 August 1939, (a mere day after the Home Secretary advised them to do so), to secure basements, country houses, Aldwych Underground station and the National Library of Wales. Many items were relocated in early 1942 from their initial dispersal locations to a newly developed facility at Westwood Quarry in Wiltshire.\nThe evacuation was timely, for in 1940 the Duveen Gallery was severely damaged by bombing. Meanwhile, prior to the war, the Nazis had sent a researcher to the British Museum for several years with the aim of \"compiling an anti-Semitic history of Anglo-Jewry\".\nAfter the war, the museum continued to collect from all countries and all centuries: among the most spectacular additions were the 2600 BC Mesopotamian treasure from Ur, discovered during Leonard Woolley's 1922â34 excavations. Gold, silver and garnet grave goods from the Anglo-Saxon ship burial at Sutton Hoo (1939) and late Roman silver tableware from Mildenhall, Suffolk (1946). The immediate post-war years were taken up with the return of the collections from protection and the restoration of the museum after the Blitz. Work also began on restoring the damaged Duveen Gallery.\n\n\n=== A new public face (1950â1975) ===\n\nIn 1953, the museum celebrated its bicentenary. Many changes followed: the first full-time in-house designer and publications officer were appointed in 1964, the Friends organisation was set up in 1968, an Education Service established in 1970 and publishing house in 1973. In 1963, a new Act of Parliament introduced administrative reforms. It became easier to lend objects, the constitution of the board of trustees changed and the Natural History Museum became fully independent. By 1959 the Coins and Medals office suite, completely destroyed during the war, was rebuilt and re-opened, attention turned towards the gallery work with new tastes in design leading to the remodelling of Robert Smirke's Classical and Near Eastern galleries. In 1962 the Duveen Gallery was finally restored and the Parthenon Sculptures were moved back into it, once again at the heart of the museum.\nBy the 1970s, the museum was again expanding. More services for the public were introduced; visitor numbers soared, with the temporary exhibition \"Treasures of Tutankhamun\" in 1972, attracting 1,694,117 visitors, the most successful in British history. In the same year the Act of Parliament establishing the British Library was passed, separating the collection of manuscripts and printed books from the British Museum. This left the museum with antiquities; coins, medals and paper money; prints and drawings; and ethnography. A pressing problem was finding space for additions to the library which now required an extra 1+1â4 miles (2.0 km) of shelving each year. The Government suggested a site at St Pancras for the new British Library but the books did not leave the museum until 1997.\n\n\n=== The Great Court emerges (1975â2000) ===\nThe departure of the British Library to a new site at St Pancras, finally achieved in 1998, provided the space needed for the books. It also created the opportunity to redevelop the vacant space in Robert Smirke's 19th-century central quadrangle into the Queen Elizabeth II Great Court â the largest covered square in Europe â which opened in 2000. The ethnography collections, which had been housed in the short-lived Museum of Mankind at 6 Burlington Gardens from 1970, were returned to new purpose-built galleries in the museum in 2000.\nThe museum again readjusted its collecting policies as interest in \"modern\" objects: prints, drawings, medals and the decorative arts reawakened. Ethnographical fieldwork was carried out in places as diverse as New Guinea, Madagascar, Romania, Guatemala and Indonesia and there were excavations in the Near East, Egypt, Sudan and the UK. The Weston Gallery of Roman Britain, opened in 1997, displayed a number of recently discovered hoards which demonstrated the richness of what had been considered an unimportant part of the Roman Empire. The museum turned increasingly towards private funds for buildings, acquisitions and other purposes. In 2000, the British Museum was awarded National Heritage Museum of the Year.\n\n\n=== The British Museum today ===\n\nToday the museum no longer houses collections of natural history, and the books and manuscripts it once held now form part of the independent British Library. The museum nevertheless preserves its universality in its collections of artefacts representing the cultures of the world, ancient and modern. The original 1753 collection has grown to over 13 million objects at the British Museum, 70 million at the Natural History Museum and 150 million at the British Library.\nThe Round Reading Room, which was designed by the architect Sydney Smirke, opened in 1857. For almost 150 years researchers came here to consult the museum's vast library. The Reading Room closed in 1997 when the national library (the British Library) moved to a new building at St Pancras. Today it has been transformed into the Walter and Leonore Annenberg Centre.\nWith the bookstacks in the central courtyard of the museum empty, the demolition for Lord Foster's glass-roofed Great Court could begin. The Great Court, opened in 2000, while undoubtedly improving circulation around the museum, was criticised for having a lack of exhibition space at a time when the museum was in serious financial difficulties and many galleries were closed to the public. At the same time the African collections that had been temporarily housed in 6 Burlington Gardens were given a new gallery in the North Wing funded by the Sainsbury family â with the donation valued at Â£25 million.\nThe museum's online database had nearly 4,500,000 individual object entries in 2,000,000 records at the start of 2023. In 2022â23 there were 27 million visits to the website. This compares with 19.5 millions website visits in 2013.\nThere were 5,820,860 visits to the museum in 2023, a 42% increase on 2022. The museum was the most visited tourist attraction in Britain in 2023. The number of visits, however, has not recovered to the level reached before the Covid pandemic.\nA number of films have been shot at the British Museum.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\n\n=== Director ===\nThe British Museum is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport through a three-year funding agreement. Its head is the Director of the British Museum. The British Museum was run from its inception by a 'principal librarian' (when the book collections were still part of the museum), a role that was renamed 'director and principal librarian' in 1898, and 'director' in 1973 (on the separation of the British Library).\n\n\n=== Trustees ===\nA board of 25 trustees (with the director as their accounting officer for the purposes of reporting to Government) is responsible for the general management and control of the museum, in accordance with the British Museum Act 1963 and the Museums and Galleries Act 1992. Prior to the 1963 Act, it was chaired by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lord Chancellor and the Speaker of the House of Commons. The board was formed on the museum's inception to hold its collections in trust for the nation without actually owning them themselves, and now fulfil a mainly advisory role. Trustee appointments are governed by the regulatory framework set out in the code of practice on public appointments issued by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments.\n\n\n== Building ==\n\nThe Greek Revival faÃ§ade facing Great Russell Street is a characteristic building of Sir Robert Smirke, with 44 columns in the Ionic order 45 ft (14 m) high, closely based on those of the temple of Athena Polias at Priene in Asia Minor. The pediment over the main entrance is decorated by sculptures by Sir Richard Westmacott depicting The Progress of Civilisation, consisting of fifteen allegorical figures, installed in 1852.\nThe construction commenced around the courtyard with the East Wing (The King's Library) in 1823â1828, followed by the North Wing in 1833â1838, which originally housed among other galleries a reading room, now the Wellcome Gallery. Work was also progressing on the northern half of the West Wing (The Egyptian Sculpture Gallery) 1826â1831, with Montagu House demolished in 1842 to make room for the final part of the West Wing, completed in 1846, and the South Wing with its great colonnade, initiated in 1843 and completed in 1847, when the Front Hall and Great Staircase were opened to the public. The museum is faced with Portland stone, but the perimeter walls and other parts of the building were built using Haytor granite from Dartmoor in South Devon, transported via the unique Haytor Granite Tramway.\n\nIn 1846 Robert Smirke was replaced as the museum's architect by his brother Sydney Smirke, whose major addition was the Round Reading Room 1854â1857; at 140 feet (43 m) in diameter it was then the second widest dome in the world, the Pantheon in Rome being slightly wider.\nThe next major addition was the White Wing 1882â1884 added behind the eastern end of the South Front, the architect being Sir John Taylor.\nIn 1895, Parliament gave the museum trustees a loan of Â£200,000 to purchase from the Duke of Bedford all 69 houses which backed onto the museum building in the five surrounding streets â Great Russell Street, Montague Street, Montague Place, Bedford Square and Bloomsbury Street. The trustees planned to demolish these houses and to build around the west, north and east sides of the museum new galleries that would completely fill the block on which the museum stands. The architect Sir John James Burnet was petitioned to put forward ambitious long-term plans to extend the building on all three sides. Most of the houses in Montague Place were knocked down a few years after the sale. Of this grand plan only the Edward VII galleries in the centre of the North Front were ever constructed, these were built 1906â14 to the design by J.J. Burnet, and opened by King George V and Queen Mary in 1914. They now house the museum's collections of Prints and Drawings and Oriental Antiquities. There was not enough money to put up more new buildings, and so the houses in the other streets are nearly all still standing.\nThe Duveen Gallery, sited to the west of the Egyptian, Greek & Assyrian sculpture galleries, was designed to house the Elgin Marbles by the American Beaux-Arts architect John Russell Pope. Although completed in 1938, it was hit by a bomb in 1940 and remained semi-derelict for 22 years, before reopening in 1962. Other areas damaged during World War II bombing included: in September 1940 two unexploded bombs hit the Edward VII galleries, the King's Library received a direct hit from a high explosive bomb, incendiaries fell on the dome of the Round Reading Room but did little damage; on the night of 10 to 11 May 1941 several incendiaries fell on the south-west corner of the museum, destroying the book stack and 150,000 books in the courtyard and the galleries around the top of the Great Staircase â this damage was not fully repaired until the early 1960s.\n\nThe Queen Elizabeth II Great Court is a covered square at the centre of the British Museum designed by the engineers Buro Happold and the architects Foster and Partners. The Great Court opened in December 2000 and is the largest covered square in Europe. The roof is a glass and steel construction, built by an Austrian steelwork company, with 1,656 uniquely shaped panes of glass. At the centre of the Great Court is the Reading Room vacated by the British Library, its functions now moved to St Pancras.\nToday, the British Museum has grown to become one of the largest museums in the world, covering an area of over 92,000 m2 (990,000 sq. ft). In addition to 21,600 m2 (232,000 sq. ft) of on-site storage space, and 9,400 m2 (101,000 sq. ft) of external storage space. Altogether, the British Museum showcases on public display less than 1% of its entire collection, approximately 50,000 items.\nThere are nearly one hundred galleries open to the public, representing 2 miles (3.2 km) of exhibition space, although the less popular ones have restricted opening times. However, the lack of a large temporary exhibition space led to the Â£135 million World Conservation and Exhibitions Centre to provide one and to concentrate all the museum's conservation facilities into one centre. This project was announced in July 2007, with the architects Rogers Stirk Harbour and Partners. It was granted planning permission in December 2009 and was completed in time for the Viking exhibition in March 2014. In 2017, the World Conservation and Exhibitions Centre was shortlisted for the Stirling Prize for excellence in architecture.\nBlythe House in West Kensington is used by the museum for off-site storage of small and medium-sized artefacts, and Franks House in East London is used for storage and work on the \"Early Prehistory\" â Palaeolithic and Mesolithic â and some other collections.\n\n\n== Departments ==\n\n\n=== Department of Egypt and Sudan ===\n\nThe British Museum houses the world's largest and most comprehensive collection of Egyptian antiquities (with over 100,000 pieces) outside the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. A collection of immense importance for its range and quality, it includes objects of all periods from virtually every site of importance in Egypt and the Sudan. Together, they illustrate every aspect of the cultures of the Nile Valley (including Nubia), from the Predynastic Neolithic period (c.â10,000 BC) through Coptic (Christian) times (12th century AD), and up to the present day, a time-span over 11,000 years.\nEgyptian antiquities have formed part of the British Museum collection ever since its foundation in 1753 after receiving 160 Egyptian objects from Sir Hans Sloane. After the defeat of the French forces under Napoleon at the Battle of the Nile in 1801, the Egyptian antiquities collected were confiscated by the British army and presented to the British Museum in 1803. These works, which included the famed Rosetta Stone, were the first important group of large sculptures to be acquired by the museum. Thereafter, the UK appointed Henry Salt as consul in Egypt who amassed a huge collection of antiquities, some of which were assembled and transported with great ingenuity by the famous Italian explorer Giovanni Belzoni. Most of the antiquities Salt collected were purchased by the British Museum and the MusÃ©e du Louvre.\nBy 1866 the collection consisted of some 10,000 objects. Antiquities from excavations started to come to the museum in the latter part of the 19th century as a result of the work of the Egypt Exploration Fund under the efforts of E.A. Wallis Budge. Over the years more than 11,000 objects came from this source, including pieces from Amarna, Bubastis and Deir el-Bahari. Other organisations and individuals also excavated and donated objects to the British Museum, including Flinders Petrie's Egypt Research Account and the British School of Archaeology in Egypt, as well as the University of Oxford Expedition to Kawa and Faras in Sudan.\n\nActive support by the museum for excavations in Egypt continued to result in important acquisitions throughout the 20th century until changes in antiquities laws in Egypt led to the suspension of policies allowing finds to be exported, although divisions still continue in Sudan. The British Museum conducted its own excavations in Egypt where it received divisions of finds, including Asyut (1907), Mostagedda and Matmar (1920s), Ashmunein (1980s) and sites in Sudan such as Soba, Kawa and the Northern Dongola Reach (1990s). The size of the Egyptian collections now stand at over 110,000 objects.\nIn autumn 2001 the eight million objects forming the museum's permanent collection were further expanded by the addition of six million objects from the Wendorf Collection of Egyptian and Sudanese Prehistory. These were donated by Professor Fred Wendorf of Southern Methodist University in Texas, and comprise the entire collection of artefacts and environmental remains from his excavations at Prehistoric sites in the Sahara Desert between 1963 and 1997. Other fieldwork collections have recently come from Dietrich and Rosemarie Klemm (University of Munich) and William Adams (University of Kentucky).\nThe seven permanent Egyptian galleries at the British Museum, which include its largest exhibition space (Room 4, for monumental sculpture), can display only 4% of its Egyptian holdings. The second-floor galleries have a selection of the museum's collection of 140 mummies and coffins, the largest outside Cairo. A high proportion of the collection comes from tombs or contexts associated with the cult of the dead, and it is these pieces, in particular the mummies, that remain among the most eagerly sought-after exhibits by visitors to the museum.\nHighlights of the collections include:\nPredynastic and Early Dynastic period (c.â6000 BC â c.â2690 BC)\n\nMummy of Ginger and five other

Department of Greece and Rome ===\n\nThe British Museum has one of the world's largest and most comprehensive collections of antiquities from the Classical world, with over 100,000 objects. These mostly range in date from the beginning of the Greek Bronze Age (about 3200 BC) to the establishment of Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire, with the Edict of Milan under the reign of the Roman emperor Constantine I in 313 AD. Archaeology was in its infancy during the nineteenth century and many pioneering individuals began excavating sites across the Classical world, chief among them for the museum were Charles Newton, John Turtle Wood, Robert Murdoch Smith and Charles Fellows.\nThe Greek objects originate from across the Ancient Greek world, from the mainland of Greece and the Aegean Islands, to neighbouring lands in Asia Minor and Egypt in the eastern Mediterranean and as far as the western lands of Magna Graecia that include Sicily and southern Italy. The Cycladic, Minoan and Mycenaean cultures are represented, and the Greek collection includes important sculpture from the Parthenon in Athens, as well as elements of two of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus and the Temple of Artemis at Ephesos.\nBeginning from the early Bronze Age, the department also houses one of the widest-ranging collections of Italic and Etruscan antiquities outside Italy, as well as extensive groups of material from Cyprus and non-Greek colonies in Lycia and Caria on Asia Minor. There is some material from the Roman Republic, but the collection's strength is in its comprehensive array of objects from across the Roman Empire, with the exception of Britain (which is the mainstay of the Department of Prehistory and Europe).\nThe collections of ancient jewellery and bronzes, Greek vases (many from graves in southern Italy that were once part of Sir William Hamilton's and Chevalier Durand's collections), Roman glass including the famous Cameo glass Portland Vase, Roman gold glass (the second largest collection after the Vatican Museums), Roman mosaics from Carthage and Utica in North Africa that were excavated by Nathan Davis, and silver hoards from Roman Gaul (some of which were bequeathed by the philanthropist and museum trustee Richard Payne Knight), are particularly important. Cypriot antiquities are strong too and have benefited from the purchase of Sir Robert Hamilton Lang's collection as well as the bequest of Emma Turner in 1892, which funded many excavations on the island. Roman sculptures (many of which are copies of Greek originals) are particularly well represented by the Townley collection as well as residual sculptures from the famous Farnese collection.\nObjects from the Department of Greece and Rome are located throughout the museum, although many of the architectural monuments are to be found on the ground floor, with connecting galleries from Gallery 5 to Gallery 23. On the upper floor, there are galleries devoted to smaller material from ancient Italy, Greece, Cyprus and the Roman Empire.\nThe current collection includes:\nTemple of Hephaestus\n\nMarble coffer

Department of the Middle East ===\n\nWith a collection numbering some 330,000 works, the British Museum possesses the world's largest and most important collection of Mesopotamian antiquities outside Iraq. A collection of immense importance, the holdings of Assyrian sculpture, Babylonian and Sumerian antiquities are among the most comprehensive in the world with entire suites of rooms panelled in alabaster Assyrian palace reliefs from Nimrud, Nineveh and Khorsabad.\nThe collections represent the civilisations of the ancient Near East and its adjacent areas. These cover Mesopotamia, Persia, the Arabian Peninsula, Anatolia, the Caucasus, parts of Central Asia, Syria, the Holy Land and Phoenician settlements in the western Mediterranean from the prehistoric period and include objects from the 7th century.\nThe first significant addition of Mesopotamian objects was from the collection of Claudius James Rich in 1825. The collection was later dramatically enlarged by the excavations of A. H. Layard at the Assyrian sites of Nimrud and Nineveh between 1845 and 1851. At Nimrud, Layard discovered the North-West Palace of Ashurnasirpal II, as well as three other palaces and various temples. He later uncovered the Palace of Sennacherib at Nineveh with 'no less than seventy-one halls'. As a result, a large numbers of Lamassus, palace reliefs, stelae, including the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III, were brought to the British Museum.\n\nLayard's work was continued by his assistant, Hormuzd Rassam and in 1852â1854 he went on to discover the North Palace of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh with many magnificent reliefs, including the famous Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal and Lachish reliefs. He also discovered the Royal Library of Ashurbanipal, a large collection of cuneiform tablets of enormous importance that today number around 130,000 pieces. W. K. Loftus excavated in Nimrud between 1850 and 1855 and found a remarkable hoard of ivories in the Burnt Palace. Between 1878 and 1882 Rassam greatly improved the museum's holdings with exquisite objects including the Cyrus Cylinder from Babylon, the bronze gates from Balawat, important objects from Sippar, and a fine collection of Urartian bronzes from Toprakkale including a copper figurine of a winged, human-headed bull.\nIn the early 20th century excavations were carried out at Carchemish, Turkey by D. G. Hogarth and Leonard Woolley, the latter assisted by T. E. Lawrence. The Mesopotamian collections were greatly augmented by excavations in southern Iraq after the First World War. From Tell al-Ubaid came the bronze furnishings of a Sumerian temple, including life-sized lions and a panel featuring the lion-headed eagle Indugud found by H. R. Hall in 1919â24. Woolley went on to excavate Ur between 1922 and 1934, discovering the Royal Cemeteries of the 3rd millennium BC. Some of the masterpieces include the Standard of Ur, the Ram in a Thicket, the Royal Game of Ur, and two bull-headed lyres. The department also has three diorite statues of the ruler Gudea from the ancient state of Lagash and a series of limestone kudurru or boundary stones from different locations across ancient Mesopotamia.\n\nAlthough the collections centre on Mesopotamia, most of the surrounding areas are well represented. The Achaemenid collection was enhanced with the addition of the Oxus Treasure in 1897 and objects excavated by the German scholar Ernst Herzfeld and the Hungarian-British explorer Sir Aurel Stein. Reliefs and sculptures from the site of Persepolis were donated by Sir Gore Ouseley in 1825 and the 5th Earl of Aberdeen in 1861 and the museum received part of a pot-hoard of jewellery from Pasargadae as the division of finds in 1963 and part of the Ziwiye hoard in 1971.  A large column base from the One Hundred Column Hall at Persepolis was acquired in exchange from the Oriental Institute, Chicago. Moreover, the museum has been able to acquire one of the greatest assemblages of Achaemenid silverware in the world. The later Sasanian Empire is also well represented by ornate silver plates and cups, many representing ruling monarchs hunting lions and deer. Phoenician antiquities come from across the region, but the Tharros collection from Sardinia, the hoard of about 150 metal bowls and hundreds of ivories from Nimrud, PhÅnician inscriptions from Carthage including the Son of Baalshillek marble base, the Carthage Tariff and the Carthage tower model and the many punic stelae from Carthage and Maghrawa in Tunisia are outstanding. The number of Phoenician inscriptions from sites across Cyprus is also considerable, and include artefacts found at the Kition necropolis (with the two Kition Tariffs having the longest Phoenician inscription discovered on the island), the Idalion temple site and two bilingual pedestals found at Tamassos. Another often overlooked highlight is Yemeni antiquities, the finest collection outside that country. Furthermore, the museum has a representative collection of Dilmun and Parthian material excavated from various burial mounds at the ancient sites of A'ali and Shakhura (that included a Roman ribbed glass bowl) in Bahrain.\nFrom the modern state of Syria come almost forty funerary busts from Palmyra and a group of stone reliefs from the excavations of Max von Oppenheim at Tell Halaf that was purchased in 1920. More material followed from the excavations of Max Mallowan at Chagar Bazar and Tell Brak in 1935â1938 and from Woolley at Alalakh in the years just before and after the Second World War. Mallowan returned with his wife Agatha Christie to carry out further digs at Nimrud in the postwar period which secured many important artefacts for the museum. The collection of Palestinian material was strengthened by the work of Kathleen Kenyon at Tell es-Sultan (Jericho) in the 1950s and the acquisition in 1980 of around 17,000 objects found at Lachish by the Wellcome-Marston expedition of 1932â1938.  Archaeological digs are still taking place where permitted in the Middle East, and, depending on the country, the museum continues to receive a share of the finds from sites such as Tell es Sa'idiyeh in Jordan.\nThe museum's collection of Islamic art, including archaeological material, numbers about 40,000 objects, one of the largest of its kind in the world. As such, it contains a broad range of pottery, paintings, tiles, metalwork, glass, seals, and inscriptions from across the Islamic world, from Spain in the west to India in the east. It is particularly famous for its collection of Iznik ceramics (the largest in the world), its large number of mosque lamps including one from the Dome of the Rock, mediaeval metalwork such as the Vaso Vescovali with its depictions of the Zodiac, a fine selection of astrolabes, and Mughal paintings and precious artwork including a large jade terrapin made for the emperor Jahangir. Thousands of objects were excavated after the war by professional archaeologists at Iranian sites such as Siraf by David Whitehouse and Alamut Castle by Peter Willey. The collection was augmented in 1983 by the Godman bequest of Iznik, Hispano-Moresque and early Iranian pottery. Artefacts from the Islamic world are on display in Gallery 34 of the museum.\nA representative selection from the Department of Middle East, including the most important pieces, are on display in 13 galleries throughout the museum and total some 4,500 objects. A whole suite of rooms on the ground floor display the sculptured reliefs from the Assyrian palaces at Nineveh, Nimrud and Khorsabad, while 8 galleries on the upper floor hold smaller material from ancient sites across the Middle East. The remainder form the study collection which ranges in size from beads to large sculptures. They include approximately 130,000 cuneiform tablets from Mesopotamia.\nHighlights of the collections include:\nNimrud:\n\nNineveh:\n\nOther Mesopotamian sites\n\nWider collection:\nPlastered human skull from Jericho, a very early form of portraiture, Palestine, (7000â6000 BC)\nTell Brak Head, one of the oldest portrait busts from the Middle East, north east Syria, (3500â3300 BC)\nUruk Trough, one of the earliest surviving works of narrative relief sculpture from the Middle East, southern Iraq, (3300â3000 BC)\nPair of inscribed stone objects known as the Blau Monuments from Uruk, Iraq, (3100â2700 BC)\nHoard of Bronze Age gold jewellery found at the Canaanite site of Tell el-Ajjul in Gaza, (1750â1550 BC)\nStatue of Idrimi from the ancient city of Alalakh, southern Turkey, (1600 BC)\nBronze bowl and ivory cosmetic box in the shape of a fish from Tell es-Sa'idiyeh, Jordan, (1250â1150 BC)\nGroup of 16 stone reliefs from the palace of King Kapara at Tell Halaf, northern Syria, (10th century BC)\nTablet of Shamash, depicting the sun-god Shamash, from Sippar, Iraq, (early 9th century BC)\nHittite lion head from the monument to King Katuwa at Carchemish, southern Turkey, (9th century BC)\nTwo large Assyrian stelae from Kurkh, southern Turkey, (850 BC)\nSeated statue of Kidudu or guardian spirit from the Assyrian city of Assur under Shalmaneser III, Iraq, (835 BC)\nBasalt bowl with engraved inscription in Hieroglyphic Luwian found at Babylon, southern Iraq, (8th century BC)\nBabylonian Chronicles, series of tablets recording major events in Babylonian history, Babylon, Iraq, (8thâ3rd centuries BC)\nShebna Inscription from Siloam near Jerusalem, (7th century BC)\nGroup of 4 bronze shields with inscription of king Rusa III from the temple of Khaldi at the Urartian fortress of Toprakkale, eastern Turkey, (650 BC)\nEast India House Inscription from Babylon, Iraq, (604â562 BC)\nLachish Letters, group of ostraka written in alphabetic Hebrew from Lachish, Israel, (586 BC)\nCylinder of Nabonidus, foundation cylinder of King Nabonidus, Sippar, Iraq, (555â540 BC)\nThe famous Oxus Treasure, the largest ancient Persian hoard of gold artefacts, (550â330 BC)\nJar of Xerxes I, alabaster alabastron with quadrilingual signature of Achaemenid ruler Xerxes I, found in the ruins of the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, Turkey, (486â465 BC)\nIdalion Bilingual, bilingual Cypriot-Phoenician inscription, key to the decipherment of the Cypriot syllabary, Idalion, Cyprus, (388 BC)\nPunic-Libyan Inscription from the Mausoleum of Ateban, key to the decipherment of the Numidian language, Dougga, Tunisia, (146 BC)\nAmran Tablets found near Sana'a, Yemen, (1st century BC)\nOne of the pottery storage jars containing the Dead Sea Scrolls found in a cave near Qumran, Jordan, (4 BC â 68 AD)\nTwo limestone ossuaries from caves in Jerusalem, (1st century AD)\nFragment of a carved basalt architrave depicting a lion's head from the Temple of Garni, Armenia, (1st century AD)\nGroup of boulders with Safaitic inscriptions from Jordan/Syria, one of which was donated by Gertrude Bell, (1stâ2nd centuries AD)\nParthian dynasty gold belt-buckle with central repoussÃ© figure of eagle with outstretched wings from Nihavand, Iran, (1stâ3rd centuries AD)\nSilver bowl from Khwarezm depicting a four-armed goddess seated on a lion, Kazakhstan,  (658 AD)\nOne of the rare Hedwig glasses, originating from the Middle East or Norman Sicily, (10thâ12th centuries AD)\nHoard of Seljuq artefacts from Hamadan including gold cup, silver gilt belt fittings and dress accessories, Iran, (11thâ12th centuries)\nIslamic brass ewers with engraved decoration and inlaid with silver and copper from Herat, Afghanistan and Mosul, Iraq (12thâ13th centuries AD)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Department of Prints and Drawings ===\nThe Department of Prints and Drawings holds the national collection of Western prints and drawings. It ranks as one of the largest and best print room collections in existence alongside the Albertina in Vienna, the Paris collections and the Hermitage. The holdings are easily accessible to the general public in the Study Room, unlike many such collections. The department also has its own exhibition gallery in Room 90, where the displays and exhibitions change several times a year.\nSince its foundation in 1808, the prints and drawings collection has grown to international renown as one of the richest and most representative collections in the world. There are approximately 50,000 drawings and over two million prints. The collection of drawings covers the period from the 14th century to the present, and includes many works of the highest quality by the leading artists of the European schools. The collection of prints covers the tradition of fine printmaking from its beginnings in the 15th century up to the present, with near complete holdings of most of the great names before the 19th century. Key benefactors to the department have been Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode, Richard Payne Knight, John Malcolm, Campbell Dodgson, CÃ©sar Mange de Hauke and TomÃ¡s Harris. Writer and author Louis Alexander Fagan, who worked in the department 1869â1894 made significant contributions to the department in form of his Handbook to the Department, as well as various other books about the museum in general.\nThere are groups of drawings by Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Michelangelo, (including his only surviving full-scale cartoon), DÃ¼rer (a collection of 138 drawings is one of the finest in existence), Peter Paul Rubens, Rembrandt, Claude and Watteau, and largely complete collections of the works of all the great printmakers including DÃ¼rer (99 engravings, 6 etchings and most of his 346 woodcuts), Rembrandt and Goya. More than 30,000 British drawings and watercolours include important examples of work by Hogarth, Sandby, Turner, Girtin, Constable, Cotman, Cox, Gillray, Rowlandson, Towne and Cruikshank, as well as all the great Victorians. The collection contains the unique set of watercolours by the pioneering colonist John White, the first British artist in America and first European to paint Native Americans. There are about a million British prints including more than 20,000 satires and outstanding collections of works by William Blake and Thomas Bewick.. The great eleven volume Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires Preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum compiled between 1870 and 1954 is the definitive reference work for the study of British Satirical prints. Over 500,000 objects from the department are now on the online collection database, many with high-quality images. A 2011 donation of Â£1 million enabled the museum to acquire a complete set of Pablo Picasso's Vollard Suite.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Department of Britain, Europe and Prehistory ===\n\nThe Department of Britain, Europe and Prehistory is responsible for collections that cover a vast expanse of time and geography. It includes some of the earliest objects made by humans in east Africa over 2 million years ago, as well as Prehistoric and neolithic objects from other parts of the world; and the art and archaeology of Europe from the earliest times to the present day. Archeological excavation of prehistoric material took off and expanded considerably in the twentieth century and the department now has literally millions of objects from the Paleolithic and Mesolithic periods throughout the world, as well as from the Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age in Europe. Stone Age material from Africa has been donated by famous archaeologists such as Louis and Mary Leakey, and Gertrude CatonâThompson. Paleolithic objects from the Sturge, Christy and Lartet collections include some of the earliest works of art from Europe. Many Bronze Age objects from across Europe were added during the nineteenth century, often from large collections built up by excavators and scholars such as Greenwell in Britain, Tobin and Cooke in Ireland, Lukis and de la GranciÃ¨re in Brittany, Worsaae in Denmark, Siret at El Argar in Spain, and Klemm and Edelmann in Germany. A representative selection of Iron Age artefacts from Hallstatt were acquired as a result of the Evans/Lubbock excavations and from Giubiasco in Ticino through the Swiss National Museum.\nIn addition, the British Museum's collections covering the period AD 300 to 1100 are among the largest and most comprehensive in the world, extending from Spain to the Black Sea and from North Africa to Scandinavia; a representative selection of these has recently been redisplayed in a newly refurbished gallery. Important collections include Latvian, Norwegian, Gotlandic and Merovingian material from Johann Karl BÃ¤hr, Alfred Heneage Cocks, Sir James Curle and Philippe Delamain respectively. However, the undoubted highlight from the early mediaeval period is the magnificent items from the Sutton Hoo royal grave, generously donated to the nation by the landowner Edith Pretty. The late mediaeval collection includes a large number of seal-dies from across Europe, the most famous of which include those from the Town of Boppard in Germany, Isabella of Hainault from her tomb in Notre Dame Cathedral, Paris, Inchaffray Abbey in Scotland and Robert Fitzwalter, one of the Barons who led the revolt against King John in England. There is also a large collection of medieval signet rings, prominent among them is the gold signet ring belonging to Jean III de Grailly who fought in the Hundred Years' War, as well as those of Mary, Queen of Scots and Richard I of England. Other groups of artefacts represented in the department include the national collection of (c.100) icon paintings, most of which originate from the Byzantine Empire and Russia, and over 40 mediaeval astrolabes from across Europe and the Middle East. The department also includes the national collection of horology with one of the most wide-ranging assemblage of clocks, watches and other timepieces in Europe, with masterpieces from every period in the development of time-keeping. Choice horological pieces came from the Morgan and Ilbert collections. The department is also responsible for the curation of Romano-British objects â the museum has by far the most extensive such collection in Britain and one of the most representative regional collections in Europe outside Italy. It is particularly famous for the large number of late Roman silver treasures, many of which were found in East Anglia, the most important of which is the Mildenhall Treasure. The museum purchased many Roman-British objects from the antiquarian Charles Roach Smith in 1856. These quickly formed the nucleus of the collection. The department also includes ethnographic material from across Europe including a collection of Bulgarian costumes and shadow puppets from Greece and Turkey. A particular highlight are the three SÃ¡mi drums from northern Sweden of which only about 70 are extant.\nObjects from the Department of Britain, Europe and Prehistory are mostly found on the upper floor of the museum, with a suite of galleries numbered from 38 to 51. Most of the collection is stored in its archive facilities, where it is available for research and study.\nHighlights of the collections include:\nStone Age (c. 3.4 million years BC â c. 2000 BC)\n\nPalaeolithic material from across Africa, particularly Olduvai, Kalambo Falls, Olorgesailie and Cape Flats, (1.8 million BC onwards)\nOne of the 11 leaf-shaped points found near Volgu,

Department of Asia ===\n\nThe scope of the Department of Asia is extremely broad; its collections of over 75,000 objects cover the material culture of the whole Asian continent and from the Neolithic up to the present day. Until recently, this department concentrated on collecting Oriental antiquities from urban or semi-urban societies across the Asian continent. Many of those objects were collected by colonial officers and explorers in former parts of the British Empire, especially the Indian subcontinent. Examples include the collections made by individuals such as James Wilkinson Breeks, Sir Alexander Cunningham, Sir Harold Deane,  Sir Walter Elliot, James Prinsep, Charles Masson, Sir John Marshall and Charles Stuart. A large number of Chinese antiquities were purchased from the Anglo-Greek banker George Eumorfopoulos in the 1930s. The large collection of some 1800 Japanese prints and paintings owned by Arthur Morrison was acquired in the early twentieth century. In the second half of the twentieth century, the museum greatly benefited from the bequest of the philanthropist PT Brooke Sewell, which allowed the department to purchase many objects and fill in gaps in the collection.\nIn 2004, the ethnographic collections from Asia were transferred to the department. These reflect the diverse environment of the largest continent in the world and range from India to China, the Middle East to Japan. Much of the ethnographic material comes from objects originally owned by tribal cultures and hunter-gatherers, many of whose way of life has disappeared in the last century. Particularly valuable collections are from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (much assembled by the British naval officer Maurice Portman), Sri Lanka (especially through the colonial administrator Hugh Nevill), Northern Thailand, south-west China, the Ainu of Hokaidu in Japan (chief among them the collection of the Scottish zoologist John Anderson), Siberia (with artefacts collected by the explorer Kate Marsden and Bassett Digby and is notable for its Sakha pieces, especially the ivory model of a summer festival at Yakutsk) and the islands of South-East Asia, especially Borneo. The latter benefited from the purchase in 1905 of the Sarawak collection put together by Dr Charles Hose, as well as from other colonial officers such as Edward A Jeffreys. In addition, a unique and valuable group of objects from Java, including shadow puppets and a gamelan musical set, was assembled by Sir Stamford Raffles.\nThe principal gallery devoted to Asian art in the museum is Gallery 33 with its comprehensive display of Chinese, Indian subcontinent and South-east Asian objects. An adjacent gallery showcases the Amaravati sculptures and monuments. Other galleries on the upper floors are devoted to its Japanese, Korean, painting and calligraphy, and Chinese ceramics collections.\nHighlights of the collections include:\n\nThe most comprehensive collection of sculpture from the Indian subcontinent in the world, including the celebrated Buddhist limestone reliefs from Amaravati excavated by Sir Walter Elliot\nAn outstanding collection of

Department of Africa, Oceania and the Americas ===\n\nThe British Museum houses one of the world's most comprehensive collections of ethnographic material from Africa, Oceania and the Americas, representing the cultures of indigenous peoples throughout the world. Over 350,000 objects spanning thousands of years tells the history of mankind from three major continents and many rich and diverse cultures; the collecting of modern artefacts is ongoing. Many individuals have added to the department's collection over the years but those assembled by Henry Christy, Harry Beasley and William Oldman are outstanding.\nObjects from this department are mostly on display in several galleries on the ground and lower floors. Gallery 24 displays ethnographic from every continent while adjacent galleries focus on North America and Mexico. A long suite of rooms (Gallery 25) on the lower floor display African art. There are plans in place to develop permanent galleries for showcasing art from Oceania and South America.\nAfrica\n\nThe Sainsbury African Galleries display 600 objects from the greatest permanent collection of African arts and culture in the world. The three permanent galleries provide a substantial exhibition space for the museum's African collection comprising over 200,000 objects. A curatorial scope that encompasses both archaeological and contemporary material, including both unique masterpieces of artistry and objects of everyday life. A great addition was material amassed by Sir Henry Wellcome, which was donated by the Wellcome Historical Medical Museum in 1954.\nHighlights of the African collection include objects found at megalithic circles in The Gambia, a dozen exquisite Afro-Portuguese ivories, a series of soapstone figures from the Kissi people in Sierra Leone and Liberia, hoard of bronze Kru currency rings from the Sinoe River in Liberia,  Asante goldwork and regalia from Ghana including the Bowdich collection, the rare Akan Drum from the same region in west Africa, pair of door panels and lintel from the palace at Ikere-Ekiti in Yorubaland, the Benin and Igbo-Ukwu bronze sculptures, the beautiful Bronze Head of Queen Idia, a magnificent brass head of a Yoruba ruler and quartz throne from Ife, a similar terracotta head from Iwinrin Grove near Ife, the Apapa Hoard from Lagos and other mediaeval bronze hoards from Allabia and the ForÃ§ados River in southern Nigeria.\nIncluded is an Ikom monolith from Cross River State, several ancestral screens from the Kalabari tribe in the Niger Delta, the Torday collection of central African sculpture, textiles and weaponry from the Kuba Kingdom including three royal figures, the unique Luzira Head from Uganda, processional crosses and other ecclesiastical and royal material from Gondar and Magdala, Ethiopia following the British Expedition to Abyssinia, excavated objects from Great Zimbabwe (that includes a unique soapstone, anthropomorphic figure) and satellite towns such as Mutare including a large hoard of Iron Age soapstone figures, a rare divining bowl from the Venda peoples and cave paintings and petroglyphs from South Africa.\nOceania\nThe British Museum's Oceanic collections originate from the vast area of the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Papua New Guinea to Easter Island, from New Zealand to Hawaii. The three main anthropological groups represented in the collection are Polynesia, Melanesia and Micronesia â Aboriginal art from Australia is considered separately in its own right.  Metal working was not indigenous to Oceania before Europeans arrived, so many of the artefacts from the collection are made from stone, shell, bone and bamboo. Prehistoric objects from the region include a bird-shaped pestle and a group of stone mortars from Papua New Guinea.\nThe British Museum is fortunate in having some of the earliest Oceanic and Pacific collections, many of which were put together by members of Cook's and Vancouver's expeditions or by colonial administrators and explorers such as Sir George Grey, Sir Frederick Broome, Joseph Bradshaw, Robert Christison, Gregory Mathews, Frederick Meinertzhagen, Thomas Mitchell and Arthur Gordon, before Western culture significantly impacted on indigenous cultures. The department has also benefited greatly from the legacy of pioneering anthropologists such as AC Haddon, BronisÅaw Malinowski and Katherine Routledge. An artefact is a wooden Aboriginal shield, probably dating from the late eighteenth century. There is some debate as to whether this shield was found at Botany Bay or, given the nature of the wood being red mangrove which grows abundantly only 500 km north of Botany Bay, possibly obtained through trade networks or at an entirely different location.\nThe Wilson cabinet of curiosities from Palau is an example of pre-contact ware. Another outstanding exemplar is the mourner's dress from Tahiti given to Cook on his second voyage, one of only ten in existence. In the collection is a large war canoe from the island of Vella Lavella in the Solomon Islands, one of the last ever to be built in the archipelago.\nThe MÄori collection is the finest outside New Zealand with many intricately carved wooden and jade objects and the Aboriginal art collection is distinguished by its wide range of bark paintings, including two very early bark etchings collected by John Hunter Kerr. A particularly important group of objects was purchased from the London Missionary Society in 1911, that includes the unique statue of A'a from Rurutu Island, the rare idol from the isle of Mangareva and the Cook Islands deity figure.  Other highlights include the huge Hawaiian statue of KÅ«-ka-ili-moku or god of war (one of three extant in the world) and the famous Easter Island statues Hoa Hakananai'a and Moai Hava.\nAmericas\nThe Americas collection mainly consists of 19th and 20th century items although the Paracas, Moche, Inca, Maya, Aztec, Taino and other early cultures are well represented. The Kayung totem pole, which was made in the late nineteenth century on Haida Gwaii, dominates the Great Court and provides a fitting introduction to this very wide-ranging collection that stretches from the very north of the North American continent where the Inuit population has lived for centuries, to the tip of South America where indigenous tribes have long thrived in Patagonia.\nHighlights of the collection include Aboriginal Canadian and Native American objects from North America collected by the 5th Earl of Lonsdale, the Marquis of Lorne, the explorer David Haig-Thomas and Bryan Mullanphy, Mayor of St. Louis, the Squier and Davis collection of prehistoric mound relics from North America, two carved stone bowls in the form of a seated human figure made by ancient North West Coast peoples from British Columbia,  the headdress of Chief Yellow Calf from the Arapaho tribe in Wyoming, a lidded rivercane basket from South Carolina and the earliest historic example of Cherokee basketry,  a selection of pottery vessels found in prehistoric dwellings at Mesa Verde and Casas Grandes, one of the enigmatic crystal skulls of unknown origin, a collection of nine turquoise Aztec mosaics from Mexico (the largest in Europe), important artefacts from Teotihuacan and Isla de Sacrificios.\nThere are several rare pre-Columbian manuscripts including the Codex Zouche-Nuttall and Codex Waecker-Gotter and post-colonial ones such as the Codex Aubin and Codex Kingsborough, a spectacular series of Mayan lintels from Yaxchilan excavated by the British Mayanist Alfred Maudslay, a very high quality Mayan collection that includes sculptures from Copan, Tikal, Tulum, Pusilha, Naranjo and Nebaj (including the celebrated Fenton Vase), an ornate calcite vase with jaguar handles from the Ulua Valley in Honduras, the Lord Moyne collection from the Bay Islands, Honduras and Boyle collection from Nicaragua, over 20 stone metates with zoomorphic and anthropomorphic ornamentation from Costa Rica, a group of Zemi Figures from Vere, Jamaica, and wooden duhos from the Dominican Republic and The Bahamas.\nThere are a collection of Pre-Columbian human mummies from sites across South America including Ancon, Acari, Arica and Leyva, a number of prestigious pre-Columbian gold and votive objects from Colombia,  three axe-shaped gold diadems found near CamanÃ¡ from the Siguas culture in Peru, unique collection of Moche wooden figures and staffs from the Macabi islands off Peru, ethnographic objects from across the Amazon region including the Schomburgk and Maybury Lewis  collections and part of the von Martius and von Spix collection, two rare Tiwanaku pottery vessels from Lake Titicaca and important items from Tierra del Fuego donated by Commander Phillip Parker King.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Department of Money and Medals ===\n    \nThe British Museum is home to one of the world's finest numismatic collections, comprising about a million objects, including coins, medals, tokens and paper money. The collection spans the entire history of coinage from its origins in the 7th century BC to the present day and is representative of both the East and West. The Department of Coins and Medals was created in 1861 and celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2011.\n\n\n=== Department of Conservation and Scientific Research ===\nThis department was founded in 1920. Conservation has six specialist areas: ceramics & glass; metals; organic material (including textiles); stone, wall paintings and mosaics; Eastern pictorial art and Western pictorial art. The science department has and continues to develop techniques to date artefacts, analyse and identify the materials used in their manufacture, to identify the place an artefact originated and the techniques used in their creation. The department also publishes its findings and discoveries.\n\n\n=== Libraries and archives ===\nThis department covers all levels of education, from casual visitors, schools, degree level and beyond. The museum's various libraries hold in excess of 350,000 books, journals and pamphlets covering all areas of the museum's collection. Also the general museum archives which date from its foundation in 1753 are overseen by this department; the individual departments have their own separate archives and libraries covering their various areas of responsibility, which can be consulted by the public on application.  The Anthropology Library is especially large, with 120,000 volumes. However, the Paul Hamlyn Library, which had become the central reference library of the British Museum and the only library there freely open to the general public, closed permanently in August 2011. The website and online database of the collection also provide increasing amounts of information.\n\n\n== British Museum Press ==\nThe British Museum Press (BMP) is the publishing business and a division of the British Museum Company Ltd., a company and a charity (established in 1973) wholly owned by the trustees of the British Museum.\nThe BMP publishes both popular and scholarly illustrated books to accompany the exhibition programme and explore aspects of the general collection. Profits from their sales goes to support the British Museum.\nScholarly titles are published in the Research Publications series, all of which are peer-reviewed. This series was started in 1978 and was originally called Occasional Papers. The series is designed to disseminate research on items in the collection. To date, over 200 books have been published in this series. Between six and eight titles are published each year in this series. They can be found on the British Museum Research Repository.\n\n\n== Controversies and criticism ==\n\n\n=== Contested artefacts ===\n\nIt is a point of controversy whether museums should possess artefacts illegally taken from other countries, and the British Museum is a notable target for criticism. The Elgin Marbles, the Benin Bronzes, Ethiopian Tabots and the Rosetta Stone are among the most disputed objects in its collections, and organisations have been formed demanding the return of these artefacts to their native countries.\nThe Elgin Marbles or Parthenon Marbles claimed by Greece have been cited by UNESCO, among others, for restitution. From 1801 to 1812, Lord Elgin's agents removed about half of the surviving sculptures from the Parthenon, as well as sculptures from the Propylaea and Erechtheum. The former director of the museum has stated, \"We are indebted to Elgin for having rescued the Parthenon sculptures and others from the Acropolis from the destruction they were suffering, as well as from the damage that the Acropolis monuments, including the sculptures that he did not remove, have suffered since.\" The British Museum itself damaged some of the artefacts during restoration in the 1930s. In late 2022, the British Museum had entered into preliminary negotiations with the Greek government about the future of the sculptures.\nThere is also controversy over artefacts taken during the destruction of the Old Summer Palace in Beijing by an Anglo-French expeditionary force during the Second Opium War in 1860, an event which drew protest from Victor Hugo. The British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum, among others, have been asked since 2009 to open their archives for investigation by a team of Chinese investigators as a part of an international mission to document Chinese national treasures in foreign collections.  In 2010 Neil MacGregor, the former Director of the British Museum, said he hoped that both British and Chinese investigators would work together on the controversial collection. In 2020 the museum appointed a curator to research the history of its collections, including disputed items.\nThe British Museum has stated that the \"restitutionist premise, that whatever was made in a country must return to an original geographical site, would empty both the British Museum and the other great museums of the world\". The museum has also argued that the British Museum Act of 1963 prevents any object from leaving its collection once it has entered it. \"The Museum owns its collections, but its Trustees are not empowered to dispose of them\".  Nevertheless, it has returned items such as Tasmanian Aboriginal burial remains when this was consistent with legislation regarding the disposal of items in the collections.\n\n\n==== List of contested artefacts ====\nElgin Marbles â claimed by Greece and backed by UNESCO among others for restitution\nBenin Bronzes â claimed by Nigeria; the Nigerian government has passed a resolution demanding the return of all 700 bronze pieces. 30 pieces of the bronzes were sold by the British Museum privately from the 1950s until 1972, mostly back to the Nigerians.\nRosetta Stone â claimed by Egypt\nEthiopian Tabots, Pre-Axumite Civilisation Coins â claimed by Ethiopia\nOxus Treasure â in 2007 the President of Tajikistan ordered experts to look into making a claim for these Achaemenid Empire gold and silver artefacts.\nDunhuang manuscripts, part of a cache of scrolls, manuscripts, paintings, scriptures, and relics from the Mogao Caves, including the Diamond Sutra â claimed by the People's Republic of China\nAboriginal shield â claimed by Aboriginal people of Australia.\nHoa Hakananai'a â claimed by Chile on behalf of Easter Island\nIrish artefacts â the Bell Shrine of St. CuileÃ¡in, Londesborough Brooch, swords, half of the Dowris Hoard, part of the Mooghaun North Hoard, the Dunaverney flesh-hook, the Kells Crozier, torcs, four crucifixion plaques, armlets, seals, religious plaques, and rings.\nWelsh artefacts â the Mold gold cape the Rhos Rydd Shield, the Moel Hebog shield and the Llanllyfni lunula.\nFour stolen drawings (Nazi plunder) â Compensation paid to Uri Peled for the amount of Â£175,000 by the British Museum\nRepatriation and reburial of human remains is a controversial issue, and the British Museum has issued a policy on the subject.\n\n\n==== Nazi-looted art ====\nIn 2002 the heirs of Arthur Feldmann, an art collector murdered in the Holocaust, requested that four old master drawings stolen by the Gestapo in 1939 be returned to the family. A UK High Court judge ruled in 2005 that it would be illegal for the British Museum to return artworks looted by the Nazis to a Jewish family, despite its willingness and moral obligation to do so. The law was changed in 2009, and again in 2022 giving museums additional powers to return looted art or provide compensation. Feldmann's heirs accepted a compensation payment for a looted drawing and stated that they were happy the drawing would remain in the British Museum collection.\nAccording to the British Museum Spoliation report published by the Collections Trust in 2017, \"Around 30% of some 21,350 continental and British drawings acquired since 1933 have an uncertain or incomplete provenance for the 1933â1945 period\". The museum lists these works on its website and investigates claims for restitution.\n\n\n=== BP sponsorship ===\nSince 2016, there have been a number of protests by activist groups, trade unions and the public against the British Museum's relationship with the oil company BP which the protesters believe implicates the museum in global warming. In July 2019, Ahdaf Soueif resigned from the British Museum's board of trustees in protest against the sponsorship. In February 2020, 1,500 demonstrators, including British Museum staff, took part in a day of protest over the issue. In December 2023, it was announced that the British Museum had agreed to a new Â£50 million sponsorship deal with BP.\n\n\n=== Chairman's Advisory Group ===\nThe Chairman's Advisory Group is an informal group of business leaders who provide advice to the chairman on various issues including the museum's relationship with the British government and policy on the museum's collections. Its existence was made public after a freedom of information request by a group campaigning against the museum's links with the fossil fuel industry. The museum has declined to name the members of the advisory group as they are acting in their personal capacity.\n\n\n=== Thefts ===\nThefts from the museum include: several historic coins and medals in the 1970s; a 17th-century Japanese Kakiemon figure in 1990; two Meiji figurines and a fragment of a gold ring in 1991; fifteen Roman coins and jewellery worth Â£250,000 in 1993; and a Japanese chest and two Persian books in 1996.\nIn July 2002 a marble head, valued at Â£50,000, was stolen from the Archaic Greek gallery. In 2004, 15 Chinese artefacts including jewels, ornate hairpins and fingernail guards were stolen. In 2017, it was revealed that a Cartier diamond had been missing since 2011.\nIn August 2023, a staff member was fired after it emerged that items including gold, jewellery and gems had been stolen over a \"significant\" period of time. The incident led to an investigation by the Metropolitan Police and an independent review by the museum. Some of the missing artefacts were later found to have been sold on eBay for considerably less than their estimated value. The museum had been warned of the thefts as early as 2021. The museum's director, Hartwig Fischer, resigned because of the museum's inadequate response to the warnings of theft. The number of artefacts stolen was estimated to be about 2,000.  As a consequence of the thefts, the museum announced a five-year plan to digitise the complete collection and make it available to view online. By May 2024, 626 of the missing items had been recovered.\n\n\n=== Copyright settlement ===\nIn August 2023, the British Museum reached a settlement with the translator Yilin Wang over her translations of poetry by Qiu Jin. The museum had used her work without credit or permission in their exhibition China's Hidden Century which ran between May 2023 and October 2023.\n\n\n== Galleries ==\nBuilding\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nMuseum galleries\nDepartment of Ancient Egypt and Sudan\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nDepartment of the Middle East\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nDepartment of Greece and Rome\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Digital and online ===\nThe museum has a collaboration with the Google Cultural Institute to bring the collection online.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nChronology of Temporary Exhibitions at the British Museum, by Joanna Bowring (British Museum Research Paper 189, 2012) lists all temporary exhibitions from 1838 to 2012.\nHelen Wang, 2022. âDisplays of money and medals at the British Museum, 1759 to 2022â, Numismatic Chronicle 182, pp. 313-338.\nForgotten Empire Exhibition (October 2005 â January 2006)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nFrom January to April 2012 the museum presented Hajj: Journey to the Heart of Islam, the first major exhibition on the topic of the Hajj, the pilgrimage that is one of the five pillars of Islam.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2016â17 all-female UK terror plot â involved a plan to attack the British Museum\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website \nThe British Museum from The Survey of London\nBritish Museum elevation\n\"The British Museum Trust Ltd., registered charity no. 1140844\".

    "wikipediaText": "Richmond Place, now known as Asgill House, is a Grade I listed 18th-century Palladian villa on Old Palace Lane in Richmond, London (historically in Surrey), overlooking the River Thames. The house is on the former site of the river frontage and later the brewhouse for the medieval and Tudor Richmond Palace. It is 8 miles (13 km) from Charing Cross and was built in 1757â58 by Sir Robert Taylor as a summer and weekend parkland villa beside the river for the merchant banker Sir Charles Asgill, who was Lord Mayor of London in 1757â58. It has been described as  \"among the last villas of importance to be erected on the banks of the Thames\".\nIt was returned to its original appearance in a restoration of 1969â70 by the then-leaseholder Fred Hauptfuhrer, aided by Donald Insall Associates. This included removing the Victorian extensions.\nAsgill House has been leased from the Crown Estate since 1983 by the Asgill House Trust. The trust preserves and maintains this historic house as a heritage asset.\nThe rear garden contained a 200-year-old copper beech tree, one of the Great Trees of London; the tree died in the winter of 2013/14.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References =="

    "wikipediaText": "The Church of St Benet Paul's Wharf is a Welsh Anglican church in the City of London, England. Since 1556, it has also been the official church of the College of Arms in which many officers of arms have been buried. In 1666 it was destroyed in the Great Fire of London, after which it was rebuilt and merged with nearby St Peter's. The current church was designed by Sir Christopher Wren. It is one of only four churches in the City of London to escape damage during World War II.\n\n\n== History ==\nSt Benet's traces its history back to the year 1111, when a church was built on the site and dedicated to St Benedict. Over time the name became St. Benet's Paul's Wharf after the hythe where the church was located. To the west of the site was the watergate of Baynard's Castle, which is referenced in the biographies of Queen Anne Boleyn and Lady Jane Grey. Both the church and the castle were destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. It was redesigned by the architect Christopher Wren, and reopened in 1683. The builder was Edward Strong the Elder.\nOn 2 March 1706, Henrietta Hobart married Charles Howard, 9th Earl of Suffolk, a captain in the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons there. (Henrietta Howard subsequently became mistress to the future King George II.)\nThe church was narrowly saved from destruction in the late 19th century, when its parish was merged with that of St Nicholas Cole Abbey. After an energetic campaign by its supporters, Queen Victoria in 1879 granted the church to Welsh Anglicans for services. St Benet's continues as London's Metropolitan Welsh church, with its services conducted in the Welsh language, and with English translation provided.\n\n\n=== Present day ===\nIn 2008 the church was closed for a few months due to a \"dwindling congregation\" but reopened in time for the carol service in December that year. Services are held weekly on Sunday mornings at 11am, with occasional special services on Sunday afternoons at 3pm. The church can be toured on Thursdays between 11am and 3pm.\nThe parish is within the Conservative Evangelical tradition of the Church of England, and it has passed resolutions to reject the ordination of women and/or female leadership.\n\n\n== Exterior ==\nThe church is of dark red brick, with alternating courses of Portland stone at the corners. The tower is situated to the north-west of the nave and is capped by a small lead dome, lantern and simple short spire.\n\n\n== Interior ==\n\nThe interior is almost a square. Unusually for a Wren church, the ceiling is flat rather than domed or barrel-vaulted. The north gallery was formerly used by the Doctors' Commons, and is now used by the College of Arms. Most of the original 17th-century furnishings are still intact, including the magnificent altar table, reredos and pulpit, designed by Grinling Gibbons. The lectern and baptismal font are also original.\nThe galleries are supported by Corinthian columns. There is a memorial to Inigo Jones, who was buried in the previous church,  and a medallion bust of Sir Robert Wyseman, a benefactor of St Benet's who died in 1684.\n\n\n== Officers of arms buried in the church ==\nHon. Sir George Rothe Bellew, Garter\nSir Ralph Bigland, Garter\nSir Anthony Richard Wagner, Garter\nSir Gilbert Dethick, Garter\nSir Henry St George, Garter\nJohn Riddell Bromhead Walker, Clarenceux\nGeorge Drewry Squibb, Norfolk\nRodney Onslow Dennys, Somerset\nMajor Francis Jones, Wales\nJohn Philipot, Somerset\nJohn Charles Brooke, Somerset\nSir William Cheney, Kent\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nChurch in Wales\nThe College of Arms\nList of churches and cathedrals of London\nList of Christopher Wren churches in London\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nChurch website\nSt Benet Paul's Wharf from Friends of the City Churches\n360Â° panorama inside the church"

    "wikipediaText": "The Priory Church of St Bartholomew the Great, sometimes abbreviated to St-Barts-the-Great, is a mediaeval church in the Church of England's Diocese of London located in Smithfield within the City of London. The building was founded as an Augustinian priory in 1123. It adjoins St Bartholomew's Hospital of the same foundation.\nSt Bartholomew the Great is so named to distinguish it from its neighbouring smaller church of St Bartholomew the Less, which was founded at the same time within the precincts of St Bartholomew's Hospital to serve as a chapel of ease and occasional place of worship. The two parish churches were reunited in 2012 under the benefice of Great St Bartholomew.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Medieval church ===\n\nThe church was founded in 1123 by Rahere, a prebendary of St Paul's Cathedral and an Augustinian canon regular. While at the Vatican, Rahere dreamed that a winged beast came and transported him to a high place, then relayed a message from \"the High Trinity and...the court of Heaven\" that he was to erect a church in London's Smithfield. Rahere travelled to London and was informed that the area in his vision â then a small cemetery â was royal property, and could not be built upon. Henry I, however, granted title of the land to Rahere upon hearing his divine message.\nRahere started construction on the building with the use of servants and child labourers, who collected stones from all over London.\n\nThe priory gained a reputation for curative powers, with many sick people filling its aisles, notably on 24 August (St Bartholomew's Day). Many miracles were attributed to occur within and without the walls of the building, including \"a light sent from heaven\" from its first foundation, and especially miraculous healings; many serious disabilities were claimed to be cured after a visit. Many of these cures were undertaken at the church hospital, the still existing St Bartholomew's Hospital.\nThe last Prior was Robert Fuller, the Abbot of Waltham Holy Cross. He was favoured by King Henry VIII, having been invited to attend the christening of Prince Edward, and did not oppose the dissolution of the Priory.\nWhile much of the hospital survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries, about half of the priory's church was ransacked before being demolished in 1543. Having escaped the Great Fire of London of 1666, the church fell into disrepair, becoming occupied by squatters in the 18th century. W. G. Grace, however, was one famous congregant before its restoration in the late 19th century, when it was rebuilt under Sir Aston Webb's direction. During Canon Edwin Savage's tenure as rector, the church was further restored at the cost of more than Â£60,000. The surviving building had comprised part of a priory adjoining St Bartholomew's Hospital, but its nave was pulled down up to the last bay but the crossing and choir survive largely intact from the Norman and later Middle Ages, enabling its continued use as a parish church. The church and some of the priory buildings were briefly used as the third Dominican friary (Black Friars) of London, refounded by Queen Mary I of England in 1556 and closed in 1559. Part of the main entrance to the church remains at West Smithfield, nowadays most easily recognisable by its half-timbered, late 16th-century, Tudor frontage built on the older (13th-century) stone arch. This adaptation may originally have been carried out by the Dominican friars in the 1550s, or by the post-Reformation patron of the advowson, Lord Rich, Lord Chancellor of England (1547â51). From this gatehouse to the west door of the church, the path leads along roughly where the south aisle of the nave formerly existed. Very little trace of its monastic buildings now survive.\n\n\n=== Later history ===\nIn the early 1720s, at the suggestion of Governor of Pennsylvania Sir William Keith Bt, the American polymath and patriot Benjamin Franklin worked as a typesetter in a printer's shop in what is now the Church of St Bartholomew-the-Great.\n\nThe Lady chapel at the east end had been previously used for commercial purposes and it was there that Benjamin Franklin worked for a year as a journeyman printer. The north transept was also formerly used as a blacksmith's forge.\nThe principal remaining area of the churchyard is a raised garden, which was laid out by the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association's landscape gardener Fanny Wilkinson in 1885.\nIn 1888, new parish school rooms, with basement rooms for youth clubs and a soup kitchen, were built on part of the former burial grounds. The works were funded by in part by the rector, Sir Borradaile Savory. The foundation stone was laid on 5 July 1888 by the Duchess of Albany.\nIn 1889, a restoration programme began which saw the restoration of the Lady Chapel and south transept and a new north transept. The restored south transept was opened by Frederick Temple, Bishop of London, on 14 March 1891; and the south transept in February 1893 in the presence of the Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, Alexandra of Denmark (Princess of Wales), Edward White Benson (Archbishop of Canterbury) and other dignitaries.\nThe Priory Church was one of the few City churches to escape damage during the Blitz and, in 1941, was where the 11th Duke of Devonshire and the Hon Deborah Mitford were married.\n\nThe poet and heritage campaigner Sir John Betjeman kept a flat opposite the churchyard on Cloth Fair. Betjeman considered the priory church to have the finest surviving Norman interior in London.\nIn 2005 a memorial service was held for Sir William Wallace, on the 700th anniversary of the Scottish hero's execution nearby, organised by the historian David R. Ross.\nCharitable distributions in the churchyard on Good Friday continue. A centuries-old tradition established when twenty-one sixpences were placed upon the gravestone of a woman stipulating that the bequest fund an annual distribution to twenty one widows in perpetuity, with freshly baked hot cross buns nowadays being given not only to widows but others.\nThe Priory Church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950. In April 2007 it became the first Anglican parish church to charge an entrance fee to tourists not attending worship.\nAfter a few years in which the rector of the church was simultaneously priest-in-charge of the nearby St Bartholomew the Less, which retained its own Parochial church council (PCC) and churchwardens, on 1 June 2015, the parishes of both churches were dissolved and replaced with the united benefice of Great St Bartholomew. The Rector of the former parish of St Bartholomew the Great became Rector of the united benefice. The boundary of the new parish incorporates precisely both former parishes. There is now a single PCC and churchwardens responsible for both buildings. The parish church is St Bartholomew the Great, while St Bartholomew the Less is a chapel of ease within the parish.\n\n\n== Oriel window ==\n\nThe Oriel Window was installed inside St Bartholomew the Great in the early 16th century by Prior William Bolton, allegedly so that he could keep an eye on the monks. The symbol in the centre panel is a crossbow \"bolt\" passing through a \"tun\" (or barrel), a rebus or pun on the name of the prior.\nWilliam Camden wrote:\n\nIt may be doubtful whether Bolton, Prior of St Bartholomew, in Smithfield, was wiser when he invented for his name a bird-bolt through his Tun, or when he built him a house upon Harrow Hill, for fear of an inundation after a great conjunction of planets in the watery triplicity\n\n\n== Associated organisations ==\nSt Bartholomew the Great is the adopted guild church of various City livery companies hosting services throughout the year: the Worshipful Company of Butchers (one of the seven oldest livery companies), the Worshipful Company of Founders (whose Hall abuts the church), the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers (incorporated 1448 and one of the Great Twelve City Livery Companies) whose Hall is on the opposite side of West Smithfield, the Worshipful Company of Fletchers, the Worshipful Company of Farriers (incorporated 1674), the Worshipful Company of Farmers (incorporated 1955). The more recently established Worshipful Company of Information Technologists (incorporated 1992), the Worshipful Company of Hackney Carriage Drivers (incorporated 2004), the Worshipful Company of Tax Advisers (incorporated 2005) and the Company of Public Relations Practitioners (incorporated 2000) also have an association with St Bartholomew's.\nThe Priory Church served as the chapel of the Imperial Society of Knights Bachelor before the establishment of the Society's permanent chapel in St Paul's Cathedral in 2005.\n\n\n== Film, television, radio and music videos ==\nThe church was the location of the fourth wedding service in the film Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994) and of scenes in other films: Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, Shakespeare in Love, the 1999 film version of Graham Greene's 1951 novel The End of the Affair, Amazing Grace (2006), Elizabeth: The Golden Age (2007), The Other Boleyn Girl (2008), Sherlock Holmes (2009), Richard II of The Hollow Crown (2012), Snow White and the Huntsman (2012), Testament of Youth (2014), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) and Transformers: The Last Knight (2017). It was also used in Taboo. It was used by T-Mobile as a stand-in for Westminster Abbey in its \"royal wedding\" advertisement (2011). It has also been the location for six music videos of Libera.\nServices have also been broadcast live on the BBC Radio 3 programme Choral Evensong, most recently an Evensong service to celebrate the 900th anniversary of the foundation of the church, in 2023.\n\n\n== Rectors ==\nEdward A. Webb's history of St Bartholomew-the-Great provides an account of each rector up to W. F. G. Sandwith.\n\nâ  Rector died in post\nSeveral rectors served as President of Sion College: Thomas Westfield (1631, 1632), Thomas Spateman (1732), Owen Perrot Edwardes (1785), Sir Borradaile Savory (1905).\n\n\n== Music ==\n\n\n=== Organ ===\n\nSt Bartholomew the Great had an organ installed by John Knopple in 1715. This was superseded by an organ in 1731 from Richard Bridge. In 1886, it was replaced by the organ from St Stephen Walbrook which was installed by William Hill. Further modifications were made in 1931 by Henry Speechly & Son, in 1957 by N.P. Mander and in 1982â83 by the firm of Peter Wells. Specifications of the church's organ are detailed on the National Pipe Organ Register. Currently, the church is using a Viscount digital organ for services, but the process of acquiring a new instrument has begun.\n\n\n=== Choirs ===\nUnusually for a parish church, the Priory Church Choir comprises professional singers, directed by Rupert Gough. A choir of amateur singers, the Rahere Singers, sing for some services.\n\n\n=== Organists ===\n\n\n=== Director of Music ===\nIn 2009 the roles of Organist and Director of Music were divided into two posts.\n\nNigel Short 2009â15\n\n\n=== Organist and Director of Music ===\nIn 2015 the roles of Organist and Director of Music were recombined.\n\nRupert Gough, 2015âpresent\n\n\n=== Sub-organist ===\nBen Horden, January 2016 â May 2017\nJames Norrey, 2017âpresent\n\n\n== Notable burials and monuments ==\n\nFrancis Anthony\nSir George Hastings\nJohn Hovyngham\nSir Rice Mansel\nSir Walter Mildmay\nPrior Rahere\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\nWilliam Peryn (died 1558), Catholic theologian and Prior of St Bartholomew\n\n\n== Folklore ==\nThe ghost of Rahere is reputed to haunt the church, following an incident during repair work in the 19th century when the tomb was opened and a sandal removed. The sandal was returned to the church but not Rahere's foot, and Rahere since then, as a \"shadowy, cowled figure appears from the gloom, brushes by astonished witnesses and fades slowly into thin air. Rahere is said to appear every year on the morning of July the 1st at 7 am, emerging from the Vestry\".\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nSir John Deane's College\nSt Bartholomew the Less Church\nList of churches and cathedrals of London\nList of English abbeys, priories and friaries serving as parish churches\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nGauthier, Charlotte, ed.

    "wikipediaText": "Richmond Bridge is an 18th-century stone arch bridge that crosses the River Thames at Richmond, connecting the two halves of the present-day London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. It was designed by James Paine and Kenton Couse.\nThe bridge, which is  Grade I listed, was built between 1774 and 1777, as a replacement for a ferry crossing which connected Richmond town centre on the east bank with its neighbouring district of East Twickenham to the west. Its construction was privately funded by a tontine scheme, for which tolls were charged until 1859. Because the river meanders from its general west to east direction, flowing from southeast to northwest in this part of London, what would otherwise be known as the north and south banks are often referred to as the \"Middlesex\" (Twickenham) and \"Surrey\" (Richmond) banks respectively, named after the historic counties to which each side once belonged.\nThe bridge was widened and slightly flattened in 1937â40, but otherwise still conforms to its original design. The eighth Thames bridge to be built in what is now Greater London, it is today the oldest surviving Thames bridge in London.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe small town of Sheen on the Surrey bank of the Thames, 10 miles (16 km) west of the City of London or 16 miles (26 km) by river, had been the site of a royal palace since 1299. After it was destroyed by fire in 1497, Henry VII built a new palace on the site, naming it Richmond Palace after his historic title of Earl of Richmond, and the central part of Sheen became known as Richmond.\n\nAlthough a ferry had almost certainly existed at the site of the present-day bridge since Norman times, the earliest known crossing of the river at Richmond dates from 1439. The service was owned by the Crown, and operated by two boats, a small skiff for the transport of passengers and a larger boat for horses and small carts; the Twickenham Ferry, slightly upstream, was also in service from at least 1652. However, due to the steepness of the hill leading to the shore-line on the Surrey side neither ferry service was able to transport carriages or heavily laden carts, forcing them to make a very lengthy detour via Kingston Bridge.\nIn the 18th century Richmond and neighbouring Twickenham on the opposite bank of the Thames, both of which were distant from London but enjoyed efficient transport links to the city via the river, became extremely fashionable, and their populations began to grow rapidly. As the ferry was unable to handle large loads and was often cancelled due to weather conditions, the river crossing became a major traffic bottleneck.\nLocal resident William Windham had been sub-tutor to Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, and was the former husband of Mary, Lady Deloraine, mistress to George II. As a reward for his services, George II leased Windham the right to operate the ferry until 1798. Windham sub-let the right to operate the ferry to local resident Henry Holland. With the ferry unable to serve the demands of the area, in 1772 Windham sought parliamentary approval to replace the ferry with a wooden bridge, to be paid for by tolls.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe plans for a wooden bridge proved unpopular, and in 1772 the Richmond Bridge Act was passed by Parliament, selecting 90 commissioners, including landscape architect Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown, historian and politician Horace Walpole and playwright and actor David Garrick, to oversee the construction of a stone bridge on the site of the ferry. The Act stipulated that no tax of any sort could be used to finance the bridge, and fixed a scale of tolls, ranging from Â½d for a pedestrian to 2s 6d for a coach drawn by six horses (about 50p and Â£20 respectively in 2024). Henry Holland was granted Â£5,350 (about Â£858,700 in 2024) compensation for the loss of the ferry service. The commission appointed James Paine and Kenton Couse to design and build the new bridge.\n\nThe Act specified that the bridge was to be built on the site of the existing ferry \"or as much lower down the river as the Commission can settle\". Local residents lobbied for it to be built at Water Lane, a short distance downstream from the ferry site. The approach to the river was relatively flat, avoiding the steep slope to the existing ferry pier on the Surrey bank. However, the Dowager Duchess of Newcastle refused to allow the approach road on the Middlesex bank to pass through her land at Twickenham Park, and the commission was forced to build on the site of the ferry, despite a steep 1 in 16 (6.25%) incline.\nThe bridge was designed as a stone arch bridge of 300 feet (91 m) in length and 24 feet 9 inches (7.54 m) in width, supported by five elliptical arches of varying heights. The tall 60-foot (18 m) wide central span was designed to allow shipping to pass, giving Richmond Bridge a distinctive humpbacked appearance. It was built in Portland stone, and ran between Ferry Hill (Bridge Street today) on the Surrey side and Richmond Road on the Middlesex side; sharp curves in the approach roads on the Middlesex side (still in existence today) were needed to avoid the Dowager Duchess of Newcastle's land at Twickenham Park. Palladian toll houses were built in alcoves at each end.\n\n\n== Construction ==\n\nThe building was put out to tender, and on 16 May 1774 Thomas Kerr was awarded the contract to build the bridge for the sum of Â£10,900 (about Â£1.73 million in 2024). With additional costs, such as compensating landowners and building new approach roads, total costs came to approximately Â£26,000 (about Â£4.17 million in 2024).\nMost of the money needed was raised from the sale of shares at Â£100 each (approximately Â£16,100 in 2024) in two tontine schemes, the first for Â£20,000 and the second for Â£5,000. The first was appropriately called the Richmond-Bridge Tontine, but when it became clear that the initial Â£20,000 would not be sufficient to complete construction a second tontine was set up. Each investor was guaranteed a return of 4% per annum, so Â£1,000 per annum from the income raised from tolls was divided amongst the investors in the two tontines. On the death of a shareholder their share of the dividend was divided among the surviving shareholders. To avoid fraud, each investor was obliged to sign an affidavit that they were alive before receiving their dividend. Any revenue over the Â£1,000 per annum required to pay the investors was held in a general fund for the maintenance of the bridge.\nConstruction began on 23 August 1774. The Prince of Wales was invited to lay the first stone but declined, and so the stone was laid by commission member Henry Hobart. The bridge opened to pedestrians in September 1776 and to other traffic on 12 January 1777, at which time the ferry service was closed, although work on the bridge was not completed until December 1777. A large milestone was placed at the Richmond end, giving the distances to other bridges and to local towns.\n\n\n== Operation ==\nThere was no formal opening ceremony, and little initial recorded public reaction. However, the bridge soon became much admired for its design; an article in The London Magazine in 1779 said that the bridge was \"a simple, yet elegant structure, and, from its happy situation, is ... one of the most beautiful ornaments of the river ... from whatever point of view the bridge is beheld, it presents the spectator with one of the richest landscapes nature and art ever produced by their joint efforts, and connoisseurs in painting will instantly be reminded of some of the best performances of Claude Lorraine\". James Paine proudly illustrated it among the designs in the second volume of his Plans, Elevations, and Sections of Noblemen and Gentlemen's Houses, 1783. Richmond Bridge was the subject of paintings by many leading artists, including Thomas Rowlandson, John Constable and local resident J. M. W. Turner.\n\nSevere penalties were imposed for vandalising the bridge. The Richmond Bridge Act 1772 specified that the punishment for \"willful or malicious damage\" to the bridge should be \"transportation to one of His Majesty's Colonies in America for the space of seven years\". A warning against damage can still be seen on the milestone at the Surrey end of the bridge.\nRichmond Bridge was a commercial success, generating Â£1,300 per annum in tolls (about Â£116,510 in 2024) in 1810. By 1822, the company had accumulated a sufficient surplus that all vehicle tolls were reduced to one penny.\n\nOn 10 March 1859 the last subscriber to the main tontine died, having for over five years received the full Â£800 per annum set aside for subscribers to the first tontine, and with the death of its last member the scheme expired. On 25 March 1859 Richmond Bridge became toll-free. A large procession made its way to the bridge, where a team of labourers symbolically removed toll gates from their hinges. The toll houses were demolished, replaced by seating in 1868; investment income from the revenue accumulated during the 83 years the tolls had been charged was sufficient to pay for the bridge's maintenance.\nIn 1846 the first railway line reached Richmond. Richmond gasworks opened in 1848, and Richmond began to develop into a significant town. The District Railway (later the District line) reached Richmond in 1877, connecting it to the London Underground. Commuting to central London became feasible and affordable, leading to further population growth in the previously relatively isolated Richmond and Twickenham areas.\n\n\n== 20th-century remodelling ==\nBy the early 20th century the bridge was proving inadequate for the increasing traffic, particularly with the introduction of motorised transport, and a 10 miles per hour (16 km/h) speed limit was enforced. With the remaining investment income from tolls insufficient to pay for major reconstruction, on 31 March 1931 the bridge was taken into the joint public ownership of Surrey and Middlesex councils, and proposals were made to widen it. The plans were strongly opposed on aesthetic grounds, and the decision was taken to build instead a new bridge a short distance downstream to relieve traffic pressure.\n\nThe new Twickenham Bridge opened in 1933, but Richmond Bridge was still unable to handle the volume of traffic, so in 1933 Sir Harley Dalrymple-Hay proposed possible methods for widening the bridge without significantly affecting its appearance. The cheapest of Dalrymple-Hay's proposals, to transfer the footpaths onto stone corbels projecting from the sides of the bridge thus freeing the entire width for vehicle traffic, was rejected on aesthetic grounds, and a proposal to widen the bridge on both sides was rejected as impractical. A proposal to widen the bridge on the upstream side was settled on as causing the least disruption to nearby buildings, and in 1934 it was decided to widen the bridge by 11 feet (3.4 m), at a cost of Â£73,000 (about Â£6.55 million in 2024).\nThe Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company of Darlington was appointed to carry out the rebuilding. In 1937 each stone on the upstream side was removed and numbered and the bridge widened; the stone facing of the upstream side was then reassembled and the bridge reopened to traffic in 1940. Throughout the redevelopment, a single lane of traffic was kept open at all times. It was found that the 18th-century foundations, consisting of wooden platforms sunk into the river bed, had largely rotted away, and they were reinforced with steel pilings and concrete foundations. During the widening works the opportunity was also taken to lower slightly the roadbed at the centre of the bridge and raise the access ramps, reducing the humpbacked nature of the bridge's central section.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nJames Paine went on to design three other Thames bridges after Richmond, at Chertsey (1783), Kew (1783), and Walton (1788). Paine and Couse renewed their working relationship on the design of Chertsey Bridge, the only one of the three still in existence. Paine became High Sheriff of Surrey in 1783.\nIn 1962, Richmond Council announced the replacement of the gaslamps on the bridge with electric lighting. The Richmond Society, a local pressure group, protested at the change to the character of the bridge, and succeeded in forcing the council to retain the Victorian gas lamp-posts, converted to electric light, which remain in place today.\nIn the history of Richmond Bridge there have only been two reported serious collisions between boats and the bridge. On 20 March 1964, three boats tied together at Eel Pie Island, 1+1â2 miles (2.4 km) upstream, broke from their moorings in a storm and were swept downstream, colliding with the bridge. Although no serious damage was caused to the bridge, the Princess Beatrice, an 1896 steamer once used by Gilbert and Sullivan, was damaged beyond repair. On 30 January 1987, the Brave Goose, the Â£3,500,000 yacht of National Car Parks founder Sir Donald Gosling, became wedged under the central arch of the bridge, eventually being freed at low tide the next day.\n\nThe eighth Thames bridge to be built in what is now Greater London, Richmond Bridge is currently the oldest surviving bridge over the Thames in Greater London, and the oldest Thames bridge between the sea and Abingdon Bridge in Oxfordshire. Richmond Bridge was Grade I listed in 1952 and it is the only Georgian bridge over the Thames in London. Its bicentenary was celebrated on 7 May 1977; the commemoration was held four months after the actual anniversary of 12 January, to avoid poor weather conditions.\nThe tradition of boat hire, repairs and boatbuilding continues at the bridge and tunnels at Richmond Bridge Boathouses under boatbuilder Mark Edwards, awarded his MBE in 2013 for \"services to boatbuilding\" including construction of the royal barge Gloriana.\nJust to the south of the bridge, in a park at the Richmond end, is a bust of the first president of Chile, Bernardo O'Higgins, who studied in Richmond from 1795 until 1798. In 1998, 200 years after he left Richmond, the bust, whose sculptor is unknown, was unveiled.  The patch of ground which the statue overlooks is called \"O'Higgins Square\".  The Mayor of Richmond lays a wreath at the bust every year in the presence of staff from the Chilean Embassy in London.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of crossings of the River Thames\nList of bridges in London\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources =="

    "wikipediaText": "Hall Place is a stately home in the London Borough of Bexley in south-east London, built in 1537 for Sir John Champneys, a wealthy merchant and former Lord Mayor of London. The house was extended in 1649 by Sir Robert Austen, a merchant from Tenterden in Kent. The house is a Grade I listed building and Scheduled Ancient Monument, and surrounded by a 65-hectare award-winning garden. It is situated on the A223, Bourne Road, south of Watling Street (A207) and north of the Black Prince interchange of the A2 dual carriageway and two lesser roads.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 16th and 17th century ===\nBuilding started on Hall Place in 1537 for wealthy merchant Sir John Champneys, Lord Mayor of the City of London. Building materials included stone recycled from a nearby former monastery, Lesnes Abbey. Sir John's house consisted of a splendid central Great Hall crossed at one end by a service wing and at the other by high status family accommodation including a parlour and great chamber. The outer walls are a distinctive checkerboard pattern made of flint and rubble, a beautiful example of the masonry style popular in the late 15th and 16th century.\nIn 1649, the house was sold to another wealthy City merchant, Sir Robert Austen (1587â1666), who added a second wing built of red bricks, doubling the size of the house. Little attempt was made to harmonise the two halves, which were built in highly contrasting architectural styles. Austen was created 1st Baronet, of Hall Place in Bexley, on 10 July 1660 and briefly held the office of High Sheriff of Kent.\n\n\n=== 18th and 19th century ===\n\nThe house remained in the Austen family until the mid 18th century when Robert Austen died and the estate was purchased by a distant relative Sir Francis Dashwood. Dashwood was a politician and Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1762 to 1763, but he was also a known rake and founder of the secret and immoral Hellfire Club. Hall Place was one of a number of properties owned and managed by the Dashwood family, whose principal home was West Wycombe Park in Buckinghamshire. From 1795 Hall Place was leased as a school for young gentlemen.\nIt was Maitland Dashwood, grandson of Sir Francis, who made the next set of significant changes to the fabric of Hall Place beginning in the 1870s. Maitland and his architect Robert William Edis added the lodge, linked the house to the water mains and altered the interior by adding much of the fine wood panelling and parquet flooring. These improvements were made to prepare the house for lease.\nThe 19th and early 20th century saw a series of short-term leases to the aristocratic and the fashionable. The tenants during this period reflected a new glamorous pre-war elite and included Baron Emile Beaumont d'Erlanger and his American wife Matilda, a former Gaiety girl.\nThe last tenant of Hall Place was Lady Limerick who lived here alone from 1917 â 1943, she added a number of mock-Tudor features including beams and fireplaces. Lady Limerick and the house appeared in a 1922 edition of Country Life magazine.\n\n\n=== Second World War ===\nIn January 1944 the U.S Army's Signal Corps 6811th Signal Service Detachment arrived at Hall Place to operate an intercept station, code named Santa Fe. This Y Station was set up in a new spirit of co-operation between British and American intelligence services.\nThe Signal Corps were to participate in the Enigma code breaking operation, Ultra. The Santa Fe Y station intercepted encoded Morse signals mostly from the German Air Force and the Luftwaffe. Radio aerial wires were strung over the rooftops and the Tudor Kitchen and Great Hall were converted into âset roomsâ with banks of Hallicrafters radio receivers lined up on wood-plank tables. The Great Parlour became the soldier's dormitory.\nPost-war Hall Place was used as an annex to the local technical school for girls. From 1968 to 1995 the building was used as the headquarters of Bexley's Libraries and Museums service.\n\n\n== Hall Place and gardens today ==\n\nToday Hall Place is restored to its original Tudor and later 17th-century designs. The property is managed by the charity Bexley Heritage Trust.\nIn June 2005 Bexley Heritage Trust received a Â£2 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund to develop and improve the site for the benefit of visitors. This grant enabled the construction of the Riverside Cafe alongside the River Cray, a new visitor centre and an education suite. A 17th-century stable block was also converted into an art gallery, which displays works by local artists. The house itself is used as an exhibition space.\n\n\n== Gardens ==\n\nThe Hall Place estate includes 65 hectares of landscaped gardens and grounds, a topiary lawn, herb garden, tropical garden and long herbaceous cottage garden-styled borders.\nThe gardens at Hall Place were first opened to the public in 1952 by the Duchess of Kent. The famous topiary at Hall Place, the Queen's Beasts, were planted in 1953 in celebration of the coronation of Elizabeth II.\nThe former walled gardens include a tropical butterfly house and owl sanctuary.
