Notice the two-story rendered frontage with its distinctive central block that steps forward slightly from the wings. \n\nLook up at the impressive tripartite window with its spiral columns topped by composite capitals and decorative urns. The window features elaborate Moderne glazing in its upper section, while the wings have beautiful lunette windows. The Spanish Baroque influence is evident in the triple-arched and cusped details above.\n\nThe left wing spans four bays while the right wing has just one bay, with a carriageway underneath. You'll notice the elegant coved cornice on the outer bays and the cantilevered canopy over the entrance. The metal glazing bars create a pattern of square panes across most windows.\n\nThis building, opened in 1930 as The Granada, was designed by Cecil Masey for the exterior, while Theodore Komisarjevsky crafted the elaborate interiors. It's particularly special as it's the oldest surviving London cinema designed by Komisarjevsky, and one of very few buildings in Britain designed in the Moorish style.\n\nThe building has a rich cultural history, having hosted performances by The Beatles, Buddy Holly, and John Coltrane, and was even frequented by Alfred Hitchcock himself.",

The church rises dramatically with its Bath stone exterior, and what's particularly interesting is that it's actually incomplete - look at the western end where you can see the unfinished brick section.\n\nNotice the beautiful octagonal corner turrets with their distinctive spires and gablets at each corner of the building. The main entrance, which faces Gordon Street, features a gabled porch with elegant pointed-arch doorway and decorative window above.\n\nLooking up, you'll see the impressive five-bay nave with three large lancet windows topped by five smaller ones. The church's scale is remarkable - the nave is only 13 feet lower than Westminster Abbey's! The transepts are particularly striking with their rose windows - pay special attention to the south transept, where you'll find beautiful stained glass depicting Christ in Majesty surrounded by saints and angels.\n\nOne of the most fascinating aspects is the unfinished crossing tower - it was meant to have a 150-foot spire, but was never completed. Instead, you can see the base with its blind arcading, serving as a testament to the original ambitious plans for this remarkable building.",

The building's symmetrical wings extend outward, creating a sense of monumentality typical of 1930s institutional architecture.\n\nWhat makes this building particularly interesting is how it combines modern and classical elements. The clean lines and setback form are thoroughly modern, while the use of high-quality Portland stone and formal symmetry nods to classical tradition. When completed, it was London's tallest secular building, second only to St Paul's Cathedral.\n\nThe building remains largely unaltered since the 1930s, preserving Charles Holden's original vision of a modern university building that would be \"at home in London.\"",

This historic church is listed under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 for its special architectural or historic interest.\n\nBuilt as the headquarters of the Catholic Apostolic Church of the Irvingites, only five of the seven projected nave bays were completed. The uncompleted crossing tower was designed to have a spire 300 feet high. When the last Catholic Apostolic priest died in 1963, the church became part of the Anglican University Chaplaincy, becoming the sole place of worship in 1968.\n\nThe church's exterior features a gabled entrance porch, angle buttresses, and a 2-light and oculus plate tracery window. The east facade of the Lady Chapel has an arcaded lancet window, above which a small rose window and gable. Gabled and pinnacled buttresses are also visible on the south facade.\n\nThe interior of the church boasts a timber hammer beam roof with angels and central bosses of snowflake design, as well as roll-moulded crossing arches on clustered columns. The sanctuary roof is rib-vaulted in stone with foliated bosses, while the brass sanctuary lamp by Pugin adds to the church's ornate details.\n\nThe Lady Chapel, formerly known as the English Chapel, has a richly painted timber roof and stone angel corbels. Deeply cut stone sedilia surround the chapel, and 20th-century glass adorns the interior.\n\nAttached cast-iron railings with foliated finials complete the church's exterior, while brick and stone walls flank areas. The church's history is marked by its role as a headquarters for a now-defunct Christian sect, but it remains a significant example of Gothic Revival architecture in London.\n\nThis record has been generated from a legacy data system, and its contents reflect the original listing criteria. It serves as a testament to the church's enduring historical significance and architectural value."
