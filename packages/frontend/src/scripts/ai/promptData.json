    "ai_summary": "Welcome to Langham House Close, a remarkable example of mid-20th century architectural innovation! \n\nStanding before you is a groundbreaking residential complex designed by architects James Stirling and James Gowan in 1955-58. This is a stunning example of New Brutalist architecture, featuring eighteen flats constructed with second-hand stock brick and in-situ reinforced concrete.\n\nLook closely at the exterior and you'll notice some distinctive features:\n- Rectangular plan with three projections on each long facade\n- Brick stacks on each projection\n- Concrete bands expressing roof and floor levels\n- Thick timber windows creating an irregular but rhythmic pattern\n- Inset balconies with glazed panels in thick timber balustrades\n- Concrete gargoyles inspired by Le Corbusier's designs\n\nThe building's design is particularly notable for its honest use of materials and structural expressiveness. The architects drew inspiration from Le Corbusier's Maisons Jaoul and Dutch De Stijl movement, creating a uniquely British interpretation of modernist architecture.\n\nEach flat has been carefully designed with living spaces arranged around exposed brick fireplaces, and interiors featuring quarry tile floors and pre-cast concrete mantlepieces.\n\nThis complex represents a pivotal moment in post-war British architectural design, challenging conventional speculative housing of its time."
