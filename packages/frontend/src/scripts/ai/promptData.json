The obelisk is nearly 22 meters tall and has a fascinating journey - originally erected in Heliopolis, Egypt, it was transported to London in 1877 after being gifted by the ruler of Egypt.\n\nLook closely at the surface of the obelisk, and you'll see intricate hieroglyphic inscriptions. These were originally carved by Thutmose III and later supplemented by Ramesses II, commemorating his military victories. The detailed carvings have been remarkably preserved despite being buried in sand for nearly 2,000 years.\n\nFlanking the obelisk are two bronze sphinxes designed by architect George John Vulliamy. An interesting detail - these sphinxes are actually facing the needle rather than guarding it, due to their slightly improper installation. \n\nIf you look carefully at the western sphinx, you'll notice shrapnel damage from a German air raid during World War I in 1917 - a poignant historical mark that has been intentionally left unrepaired as a memorial.\n\nThis monument is a remarkable piece of ancient history standing proudly in the heart of modern London.","model":"claude-3-5-haiku-20241022"},{"listEntry":"1066214","audioUrl":null,"prompt":"You are an architectural tour guide, giving a tour to a person with a lay interest in historical architecture.
