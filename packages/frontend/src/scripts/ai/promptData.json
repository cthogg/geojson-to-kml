Notice the two-story rendered frontage with its distinctive central block that steps forward slightly from the wings. \n\nLook up at the impressive tripartite window with its spiral columns topped by composite capitals and decorative urns. The window features elaborate Moderne glazing in its upper section, while the wings have beautiful lunette windows. The Spanish Baroque influence is evident in the triple-arched and cusped details above.\n\nThe left wing spans four bays while the right wing has just one bay, with a carriageway underneath. You'll notice the elegant coved cornice on the outer bays and the cantilevered canopy over the entrance. The metal glazing bars create a pattern of square panes across most windows.\n\nThis building, opened in 1930 as The Granada, was designed by Cecil Masey for the exterior, while Theodore Komisarjevsky crafted the elaborate interiors. It's particularly special as it's the oldest surviving London cinema designed by Komisarjevsky, and one of very few buildings in Britain designed in the Moorish style.\n\nThe building has a rich cultural history, having hosted performances by The Beatles, Buddy Holly, and John Coltrane, and was even frequented by Alfred Hitchcock himself."

Look at the striking red brick facade with its elaborate terracotta and stone decorative elements. The building features a series of dramatic steep gables, each crowned with carved finials and decorated tympanums containing seated figures.\n\nNotice the beautiful canted bay windows on the upper floors, richly adorned with carved mythical beasts and coats of arms. The word \"SARA\" appears on decorative ribbons within these carvings. The vertical lines of the facade are emphasized by attached colonnettes and rainwater pipes with distinctive lion mask spouts dated 1908.\n\nAt the corners, you'll see impressive octagonal turrets topped with conical tiled roofs. The building's Gothic character is enhanced by round-arched window surrounds and an enriched cusped cornice at the third floor level. Look up to spot the fascinating gargoyles in the form of mythical beasts that project from the decorated parapets.\n\nAlong Gower Street, you can see the original wrought and cast-iron railings with their elaborate floral finials and scrollwork designs, adding an extra layer of Victorian craftsmanship to this remarkable building."

The church rises dramatically with its Bath stone exterior, and what's particularly interesting is that it's actually incomplete - look at the western end where you can see the unfinished brick section.\n\nNotice the beautiful octagonal corner turrets with their distinctive spires and gablets at each corner of the building. The main entrance, which faces Gordon Street, features a gabled porch with elegant pointed-arch doorway and decorative window above.\n\nLooking up, you'll see the impressive five-bay nave with three large lancet windows topped by five smaller ones. The church's scale is remarkable - the nave is only 13 feet lower than Westminster Abbey's! The transepts are particularly striking with their rose windows - pay special attention to the south transept, where you'll find beautiful stained glass depicting Christ in Majesty surrounded by saints and angels.\n\nOne of the most fascinating aspects is the unfinished crossing tower - it was meant to have a 150-foot spire, but was never completed. Instead, you can see the base with its blind arcading, serving as a testament to the original ambitious plans for this remarkable building."

This striking example of stripped Classical architecture was designed by architects P Morley Horder and V Rees.\n\nLooking at the building's elegant Portland stone facade, notice the three-story structure with its attic level. The main entrance on Keppel Street features fascinating decorative details - look up to see the central carving of entwined serpents, a traditional symbol of medicine, supporting a panel showing Aesculapius in his chariot.\n\nThe first-floor windows are particularly interesting, with their metal balconies decorated with gilded tropical insects - a unique touch that reflects the school's focus on tropical medicine. Above these, you'll see a decorative frieze bearing the names of prominent medical scientists, set between pilaster capitals adorned with laurel wreaths.\n\nThe building's steel frame construction was quite modern for its time, while the metal-framed casement windows and clean architectural lines exemplify the stripped Classical style. The corner angle features a foundation stone laid by Neville Chamberlain in 1926.\n\nThe building extends in an H-plan layout, with impressive facades along both Malet Street and Gower Street. The original stone walls and horizontal band railings still frame the building, completing this distinguished architectural composition."

Notice the striking vertical emphasis of this 210-foot tall Portland stone-clad building, with its dramatic stepped profile rising like a modern ziggurat against the sky. \n\nLook at the central tower's strong vertical lines, emphasized by the broad buttresses on the east and west facades. The windows are arranged in an elegant rhythm - at the lower levels they're larger and more ceremonial, while higher up they form neat vertical strips in groups of three.\n\nAt the base, you'll see the impressive entrance with its flat canopies and distinctive metal grilles featuring geometric patterns - a classic Art Deco touch. The building's symmetrical wings extend outward, creating a sense of monumentality typical of 1930s institutional architecture.\n\nWhat makes this building particularly interesting is how it combines modern and classical elements. The clean lines and setback form are thoroughly modern, while the use of high-quality Portland stone and formal symmetry nods to classical tradition. When completed, it was London's tallest secular building, second only to St Paul's Cathedral.\n\nThe building remains largely unaltered since the 1930s, preserving Charles Holden's original vision of a modern university building that would be \"at home in London.\""

As we stand here, you can see the dramatic multi-level interior space before us, which is one of the most impressive library designs of the post-war period.\n\nLook up at the distinctive concrete diagrid ceiling with its north-facing roof lights, creating a beautiful play of natural light throughout the space. Notice how the three levels of concrete-fronted balconies cascade down, creating a terraced effect that makes the space feel both monumental and intimate at the same time.\n\nThe concrete finishes you see throughout are of exceptional quality, with fair-faced horizontal boarding visible on the main staircase. The red handrails provide a striking accent against the concrete surfaces. Take note of the original concrete book counters - remarkable survivors that speak to the building's original function.\n\nThe bookshelves you see arranged around the perimeter house over a million volumes today, significantly more than the half-million it was originally designed for. The study spaces at the bottom level, with their long tables and reading areas, create an atmosphere perfectly suited for scholarly work while maintaining visual connections across this impressive vertical space."

The building rises four storeys high with a distinctive painted stucco exterior and rusticated ground floor treatment.\n\nLook at the symmetrical east façade with its nine windows and projecting central bays. Notice how the center is emphasized by four pilasters supporting a simplified entablature and pediment at the attic level. The windows are regularly spaced in the typical Georgian fashion, creating a pleasing rhythm across the façade.\n\nThe main entrance on the south side features a projecting porch with balustrading, and if you look closely, you'll see the square-headed doorway with its elegant paneled jambs and cornice head. The building originally had a continuous balustraded balcony at first floor level before 1947.\n\nAt ground level, don't miss the original cast-iron railings with their decorative foliated finials protecting the basement areas - these are specifically included in the listing.\n\nThis building, now the Quaker International Centre, exemplifies the refined architectural style of London's early 19th century development, when this area was being transformed into the elegant neighborhood we see today.\""

As we stand here on Markhouse Road, notice the striking combination of stock brick with red brick details that creates a lively Queen Anne style façade.\n\nLook up at the church's most distinctive feature - the circular turret with its octagonal spire and domed lantern, which gives the church its name. This unique lighthouse design was inspired by the building's patron, Captain King of the Bullard King Steamers. Notice the small cross-shaped slit windows and the spiraling white stringcourse that enhance the maritime theme.\n\nOn the main façade, you can see four bays marked by red brick colonnettes. Take note of the decorative terracotta cornices and the pedimented gable end with its circular window, or oculus, showing the date 'AD 1893'. The ground floor features two sets of double doors - look at the larger pair under an impressive pediment supported by scroll brackets.\n\nThe building's style actually shares features with Salvation Army Citadels of the period, particularly in its fortress-like qualities. Originally, the lighthouse tower even had a revolving light that would beam out during Sunday morning services - a truly unique architectural feature for an inland church."

Notice the beautiful plum-colored brick construction with distinctive red brick dressings that create subtle contrast.\n\nLooking at the front of the building, you'll see it's two stories high with five bays - the two on the left projecting slightly forward. The windows are particularly noteworthy with their segmental heads and 12-paned sash windows with original glazing bars. Above the central entrance, there's an inscribed plaque from the building's construction.\n\nThe roof is especially interesting - it's a double-pitched hipped design with traditional tiles extending to the eaves. Notice the elegant moulded timber cornice that runs along the eaves.\n\nA 1756 addition extends to the north at a slightly lower height. This section features an impressive imported doorcase from Church Hill House, complete with decorative waterleaf capitals and an arched doorway.\n\nInside, though we can't see it from here, the building retains many original features including a turned baluster staircase and simple Georgian paneling in the entrance hall. The building's transformation from workhouse to police station to museum makes it a remarkable piece of local architectural history."

The building's horizontal lines are emphasized by the brick band between floors and the rubbled brick cornice above the first floor. At the very top, in the pediment, there's a distinctive blind semicircular window.\n\nTo our right, there's a recessed six-bay wing and beyond that, a stable wing with interesting blind relieving arches. The lead rainwater heads actually display the building's construction dates - a fascinating historical detail.\n\nThis is truly one of Walthamstow's architectural treasures, and its Grade II* listing reflects its exceptional historical and architectural significance."
