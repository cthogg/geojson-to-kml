Notice the two-story rendered frontage with its distinctive central block that steps forward slightly from the wings. \n\nLook up at the impressive tripartite window with its spiral columns topped by composite capitals and decorative urns. The window features elaborate Moderne glazing in its upper section, while the wings have beautiful lunette windows. The Spanish Baroque influence is evident in the triple-arched and cusped details above.\n\nThe left wing spans four bays while the right wing has just one bay, with a carriageway underneath. You'll notice the elegant coved cornice on the outer bays and the cantilevered canopy over the entrance. The metal glazing bars create a pattern of square panes across most windows.\n\nThis building, opened in 1930 as The Granada, was designed by Cecil Masey for the exterior, while Theodore Komisarjevsky crafted the elaborate interiors. It's particularly special as it's the oldest surviving London cinema designed by Komisarjevsky, and one of very few buildings in Britain designed in the Moorish style.\n\nThe building has a rich cultural history, having hosted performances by The Beatles, Buddy Holly, and John Coltrane, and was even frequented by Alfred Hitchcock himself.","model":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"},{"listEntry":"1379009","audioUrl":null,"prompt":"You are an architectural tour guide, giving a tour to a person with a lay interest in historical architecture.
