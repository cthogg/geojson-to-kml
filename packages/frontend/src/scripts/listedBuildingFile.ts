      "This building, known as the Walthamstow Granada, is a stunning example of 1930s cinema architecture. The exterior features a Spanish Baroque-inspired design, with a rendered facade and a low-pitched pantiled roof. Look at the central entrance block, which advances slightly and features a tripartite window with engaged spiral columns and triple-arched, cusped Baroque heads. Above the entrance, there is a cantilevered canopy, adding to the building's striking appearance. The windows in the foyer block have elaborate Moderne-style glazing, while the upper-floor windows in the wings have spiral columns. The rear walls are in stock brick, and there is a carriageway underneath the right wing. The interior is equally impressive, with a rich Ionic pilastered double-height foyer and a large, elaborately decorated Moorish-style auditorium. Notice the superimposed proscenium, the Moorish fretwork, and the interlacing moulded ceiling with a star-burst center. This building is a true architectural gem, blending elements of Spanish Baroque and Moorish styles to create a one-of-a-kind cinema experience.",

      "Details\n\nThis list entry was subject to a Minor Amendment on 19 April 2023 to remove superfluous source details and reformat the text to current standards\n\n1802/4/3\n\nHOE STREET (west side) No.186, ABC Cinema\n\n24-FEB-1987\n\nII* Cinema, constructed in 1929-30 as the Granada, for Sidney Bernstein. Architect: Cecil Masey (1881-1960) with the interiors by Theodore Komisarjevsky (1882-1954). Stone frontage, brick retaining walls to steel frame. Roof not seen. Cinema with single balcony, now with small screens set underneath balcony, and set behind deep foyer with sbops to either side.\n\nEXTERIOR: two storey rendered facade in Spanish Baroque style; pantiled low-pitched roof to the eaves on the wings. The roof is not visible on the central foyer block, which is higher than the wings. The left wing is of four bays and the right is of one bay. The central block advances slightly, twice, with a tripartite window having engaged spiral columns (surmounted by composite capitals and urns) and triple-arched and cusped Spanish baroque heads. There is a cantilevered canopy over the entrance. Coved cornice to outer bays. Glazing bars of metal creating square panes, except for elaborate Moderne glazing in the tops of the windows in the foyer block and lunettes in the windows in the wings. Late 20th century shop fronts to ground floor, arched paired windows to upper floor with spiral columns. The left return wall is also rendered and has exit doors and smaller windows for stairs etc. Under the right wing is a carriageway. To the right of the main entrance is an exit door from the public house on the first floor. Rear walls in stock brick. Two steps up to original entrance doors.\n\nINTERIOR: an outer lobby leads into a rich Ionic pilastered double-height foyer (there was previously a second set of doors separating the two spaces). Between the pilasters are six mirrors with arched- heads and shaped aprons. Full entablature and fielded ceiling. At the end, central stairs descend to a lower foyer and the former stalls level, while flanking flights ascend first to a landing running the full width of the foyer and then up to a large transverse balcony foyer with a fielded segmental barrel ceiling. All stairs in Travertine. The walls of this inner foyer are divided into bays by engaged half-columns and alternating bays containing arch-headed pier-glasses over console tables. Two Art Deco ventilation grills in the ceiling. Eleven French-style chandeliers in the foyer areas. Original furniture comprising four upholstered wing chairs and three arm-chairs. Behind steps at each end are twin door-cases (doors removed) into lobbies from which the balcony is accessed by short flights to entrances in the sides of the auditorium. Large and elaborate double-height auditorium in the Moorish style. Superimposed proscenium, with Moorish fretwork on the first three coves, to accommodate cove lighting. Dado running forward from the proscenium. Ante-proscenium splay with' Maqarnas' or stalactite-work above highly ornamented grills. Side walls with larger Islamic arches incorporating more stalactite-work (enclosing two smaller arches), areas of fluting and horseshoe arches over the balcony entrances. The latter have splayed voussoirs, ornamented tympana, cusping, fluting and flanked by pilasters enlivened by low-relief Moorish decoration. Ceiling of interlacing mouldings with a star-burst centre. The sides of the rear balcony have been brought in and the ceiling rises into a cove figured with lattice decoration. More quasi-Islamic decoration can be seen in the ventilation grills on the ceiling. Serpentine balcony front. The area under the balcony is subdivided making two small auditoria but the original coffered ceiling is still visible. Stage with original tableau curtains. Original suspended light fittings. On the first floor above the entrance lobby and extending down the long wing on the front of the building, is an area which was originally a cafe and is now a public house; steps leading to its former internal entrance can be seen in the left wall of the foyer. In the cafe, vestiges of the original decoration still survives. The Christie organ also survives and is in playable condition. One console, with Saracen decoration, is mounted on a trolley and can be wheeled on to the stage. The other one, now disused and partly dismembered, is beneath the apron stage. The organ chambers are in the roof over the auditorium and are positioned above and slightly forward of the proscenium.\n\nANALYSIS: an important example of the large and elaborate cinemas built by Sidney Bernstein between 1930 and 1939, generally in artisan districts where such escapist palaces of entertainment would be most popular. The exterior is largely original, while internally, most of the 1930 appearance survives. It is one of very few cinemas (in fact buildings of any type), designed in the Moorish style in Britain. There is the added interest of the organ, with a unique console. The ABC is the oldest surviving of the cinemas designed by Komisarjevsky in London.\n\nListing NGR: TQ3724389311 Legacy\n\nThe contents of this record have been generated from a legacy data system.\n\nLegacy System number: 206901 Legacy System: LBS\n\nSources\n\nBooks and journals Eyles, A, The Granada Theatres, (1998) Gray, R, Cinemas in Britain: One Hundred Years of Cinema Architecture, (1996), 74, 77 Webb, M, Greater London's Suburban Cinemas 1946-1986, (1986), 88",

      "Walthamstow Granada (previously known as Mirth, Marvel & Maud Granada/EMD, Granada Cinema, EMD Cinema, MGM Cinema and ABC Cinema) is a Grade II* listed building housing a pub, cinema and cultural centre in Walthamstow, London. The building is famous for having been frequented by Alfred Hitchcock during its time as a cinema. It was built on a site where films were shown as early as 1896.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1930 Granada plc built a 2,697 seat cinema, opened as The Granada.  The building featured exteriors by Cecil Masey and interior decorations by Theodore Komisarjevsky.\nIn later years, as a result of changes in the building's ownership, the cinema was variously known as MGM, ABC, and EMD cinema. Although never completely renovated after the 1970s, at the time of its closure as a cinema in December 2003, it was the only cinema to have an original working Christie Organ still in place at the cinema where it was originally installed.\nOften used as a concert venue, the Granada Cinema in Hoe Street, Walthamstow, held a concert by the Beatles on 24 May 1963. Other famous musical acts to have performed there include John Coltrane, Little Richard, Gene Vincent, Jerry Lee Lewis, Alex Paterson and Buddy Holly,\n\n\n== Campaign to save building and cinema ==\n\nThe cinema closed in 2003 and was purchased by Universal Church of the Kingdom of God (UCKG) with the intention of converting the building into a church.\nMany members of the local community opposed and successfully campaigned against these plans. Comedian and presenter Griff Rhys Jones, actor Paul McGann and writer Alain de Botton are among the famous names to have backed local residents in asking the local authority to stop plans to convert the building into a church. The Waltham Forest Film Society became the focal point for local campaigners. UCKG failed to gain planning permission to convert the building from Waltham Forest Council and later from the then Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles.\n\n\n== Reopening of building 2015 ==\nIn 2014, UCKG sold the cinema to pub company Antic who reopened the building under the new name of Mirth, Marvel and Maud.\nIn May 2019, Waltham Forest Council purchased the building from Antic. Waltham Forest Council and Soho Theatre have teamed up to secure the future of the former Granada/EMD, which will operate a new local theatre with a national profile as part of the legacy of Waltham Forest's year as the first London Borough of Culture.\nSoho Theatre will operate the building as a new cultural venue for North East London. The 950-seat rejuvenated venue will operate as a local theatre with a national profile, presenting the biggest names in comedy plus theatre, performance, music, pantomime and community and education programmes.\nRenovation of the site is being carried out by Willmott Dixon Interiors and is estimated to take around three years to complete, and initial plans suggest that events could be held on the site before the project is complete. A fund of £17million has been set aside for the work, which commenced in May 2020.\n\n\n== References ==",
